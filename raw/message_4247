He considered sannyasins and sadhus to be impostors and parasites and\n=\r\nfelt that no one, however great, had the right to accept the homage of\nothe=\r\nrs. But a chance meeting with Bhagavan wrought a complete transformation\nin=\r\n this doubting Thomas and turned him into a staunch devotee.\n\nDr Ramakrishn=\r\na Iyer was his friend, philosopher and guide. Like Narayana\nIyer, this doct=\r\nor was also working in Chetpet. He was well acquainted with\nBhagavan, being=\r\n the son of Lakshmi Ammal of Tiruchuzhi, one of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\nchildhoo=\r\nd playmates. He invited Narayana Iyer to go with him to\nTiruvannamalai duri=\r\nng the Deepam festival, and his invitation was accepted,\neven though Naraya=\r\nna Iyer disliked crowds and temple festivals had no\nattraction for him; he =\r\nagreed on the condition that he would neither come\ninside the ashram nor pr=\r\nostrate to the swami if perchance he met him.\n\nCircumstances forced him to =\r\naccompany his friend into the ashram. As they\nwere coming inside, a person =\r\nclad only in a white loin cloth, a towel on his\nshoulder, a kamandalu [wate=\r\nr pot] in one hand and a walking stick in the\nother stopped in his walk in =\r\nthe opposite direction when he saw them. He\nspoke kindly to the doctor and =\r\nenquired about his mother and brother. Though\nIyer guessed that this must b=\r\ne the Maharshi, he did not look up, thinking\nthat, after all, he was a comp=\r\nlete stranger to him. On being introduced as\nthe Sub-registrar of Chetpet, =\r\nout of courtesy he looked up. Let us hear him\nnow in his own words:\n\n=E2=80=\r\n=98What a wonderful face and what a welcoming smile! Bewitching, fascinatin=\r\ng\nand a powerful look too! In a moment I was at his feet on the gravel\ngrou=\r\nnd=E2=80=A6. He is not bogus=E2=80=A6. looks genuine=E2=80=A6. but has he s=\r\nolved the mystery of\nlife, of the universe that we see around us? If not, I=\r\n withdraw my homage\nand go my way=E2=80=A6. I tried to find out if he had w=\r\nritten any books. I got a\ncopy of Ulladu Narpadu [Reality in Forty Verses] =\r\nin Tamil. It had just been\npublished.=E2=80=99\n\nAs he tried to read the fir=\r\nst stanza he was confounded and filled with\ndismay at the repeated use of t=\r\nhe word ulladu, which seemed too closely\npacked. The pure language, embodyi=\r\nng the essence of absolute reality, would\ndrive even pundits of Tamil proso=\r\ndy to despair. Someone nearby said that the\nMaharshi himself would explain =\r\nthe forty verses that night. In anxious and\neager suspense Narayana Iyer wa=\r\nited for the night.\n\nA solemn stillness pervaded the air. There was absolut=\r\ne silence. The\nMaharshi read the first stanza. The mere reading of it made =\r\nthe meaning as\nclear as clarity itself. Stanza by stanza he read and explai=\r\nned in a voice\nso sweet and melodious, it seemed to come from a transcenden=\r\nt being.\n\nThe climax came when he said, after explaining a verse, =E2=80=98=\r\nGod cannot be seen\nwith our eyes and known by our senses. This is what is m=\r\neant by saying, =E2=80=9CTo\nsee God is to be God=E2=80=9D.=E2=80=99\n\nIt fla=\r\nshed upon Narayana Iyer instantly that if He whom all religions\nacclaim as =\r\nGod were to appear before him in flesh and blood, here He is.\nSuccessive wa=\r\nves of bliss flooding from within shook his frame. He went out\nto compose h=\r\nimself.\n\nHe says, =E2=80=98I came, he saw, he conquered=E2=80=99.\n\nThe spel=\r\nl was thus cast. Henceforth Bhagavan was his God. Bhagavan was the\nway and =\r\nthe support on the way as well.\n\nTo Narayana Iyer the content of Ulladu Nar=\r\npadu became a vedic truth and its\nverses veritable mantras. He took to chan=\r\nting them as japa. From then on\nnothing could stop him from frequenting the=\r\n ashram.\n\nHis job entailed frequent transfers; he was successively posted t=\r\no Arani,\nPolur, and Shankagiri (Salem) for varying periods. However, there =\r\nwas no let\nup in his regular visits. Never a Sunday passed without Narayana=\r\n Iyer\narriving at the ashram. He always had some delectable snacks with him=\r\n which\nwere prepared by his wife Lalitha Iyer, who believed that she was co=\r\noking\ndelicacies for God. These were savoured by everyone as Bhagavan would=\r\n never\naccept anything unless there was enough for all. Very often Iyer wou=\r\nld bring\nomappodi, [a snack made of gram flour and spices] which Bhagavan a=\r\nppears to\nhave been quite fond of, and occasionally he would bring other it=\r\nems in\nquantities that would suffice for all in the hall.\n\nOnce when Shanta=\r\nmmal enquired of Bhagavan whether she could prepare some\nsnacks in the ashr=\r\nam, Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=98Tomorrow is Sunday. Narayana Iyer\nwill be ar=\r\nriving and will surely be bringing something to eat.=E2=80=99\n\nSuch was the=\r\n certainty of his arrival and of the snacks that came with him.\n\nIn those d=\r\nays [the early thirties] the area surrounding the ashram was very\nbare, wit=\r\nh no trees or shrubs. The Mother=E2=80=99s Temple was yet to be\nconstructed=\r\n. Anyone approaching the precincts of the ashram could be easily\nseen from =\r\nthe old hall. Once, between two successive weekend visits by\nNarayana Iyer,=\r\n the ashram administration, feeling that Bhagavan needed some\nrest in the a=\r\nfternoon after lunch, imposed a restriction that no one would\nbe allowed to=\r\n disturb him between 12 noon and 2 p.m. Neither Bhagavan nor\nNarayana Iyer =\r\nwas aware of this new decree. The following Sunday afternoon,\nas usual, Iye=\r\nr arrived with omappodi in hand. As he approached the hall\nthose strategica=\r\nlly positioned to deflect the would-be visitors until 2 pm,\nthe new receivi=\r\nng hour, apprised him of the rule. Iyer, though still at a\ngreat distance f=\r\nrom Bhagavan, made his customary prostration from where he\nwas, retraced hi=\r\ns steps and waited until the appointed hour.\n\nAt 2 p.m. he came before Bhag=\r\navan. Bhagavan had spied him on his arrival and\nnoted his subsequent disapp=\r\nearance.\n\nAs soon as he entered the hall Bhagavan asked him, =E2=80=98Didn=\r\n=E2=80=99t you come at 1\no=E2=80=99clock? I saw you arriving through the wi=\r\nndow and was expecting you to come\nto the hall at any moment. But you didn=\r\n=E2=80=99t come. Did you have to go\nelsewhere?=E2=80=99\n\nNarayana Iyer, who=\r\n had no idea that Bhagavan was not supposed to know of the\nnew arrangement,=\r\n replied in all innocence, =E2=80=98My train arrived late and I\ncould come =\r\nonly at 1 o=E2=80=99clock. I was informed that Bhagavan nowadays rests in\nt=\r\nhe afternoons and is not to be disturbed until 2 p.m. That=E2=80=99s why I =\r\nhave\nonly come in now.=E2=80=99\n\nBhagavan listened without any comment, oth=\r\ner than his customary, =E2=80=98Oh! Is\nthat so?=E2=80=99\n\nThe next day afte=\r\nr lunch, instead of going into the hall, Bhagavan sat\noutside the hall. The=\r\n attendant very hesitantly suggested that he go inside,\nas it was becoming =\r\nvery hot.\n\nBhagavan said, =E2=80=98Nobody is allowed to enter until 2 p.m. =\r\nIs there also a rule\nthat I should not sit here until two?=E2=80=99\n\nThen B=\r\nhagavan, the very embodiment of compassion added, =E2=80=98People come from=\r\n\nfar-away places by various means, suffering innumerable hardships in order=\r\n\nto get here. How can they be sure of the exact time of their arrival? When=\r\n\nthey come after all that trouble, how fair is it to deny them ready access=\r\n?=E2=80=99\n\nHearing this, the management immediately revoked the new rule.\n=\r\n\nIn due course, owing to the profound grace of Bhagavan, Narayana Iyer was\n=\r\nposted to Tiruvannamalai itself. He was the first in a long line of devotee=\r\ns\nto have had the rare privilege of establishing a residence near the ashra=\r\nm\nin order to be in the holy presence of Bhagavan on a regular basis. His\ne=\r\nntire sadhana comprised of simply remaining with Bhagavan whenever\npossible=\r\n, in the hall or in the kitchen, cutting vegetables, grinding\nchutney and p=\r\nreparing breakfast in the wee hours of the morning. On any\ngiven morning th=\r\ne trio of G. V. Subbaramayya, Kalyana Sundaram Iyer of the\nbookstall and Na=\r\nrayana Iyer, would be found with Bhagavan.\n\nOne year, due to an unusual spe=\r\nll of drought, the ashram faced severe water\nscarcity on the eve of Jayanth=\r\ni. The devotees, organising themselves into a\nlong chain, passed vessels fi=\r\nlled with water from hand to hand from the\nAgasthya Teertham in Palakothu t=\r\no the kitchen. Narayana Iyer very\nenthusiastically participated in this col=\r\nlective endeavour.\n\nAn extensive area of twenty grounds [one acre] was the =\r\nsite of Narayana\nIyer=E2=80=99s residence where he grew a variety of fruit =\r\ntrees and fodder for his\ncow. Whatever wild creatures found in that area we=\r\nre left to themselves.\nOccasionally, he had snakes caught and released in i=\r\nsolated spots on the\nmountain.\n\nPrior to constructing the house, Iyer took =\r\nthe plans to Bhagavan to have\nthem blessed. After careful perusal Bhagavan =\r\nobserved, =E2=80=98The plan is all\nright, but where is the well?=E2=80=99\n\n=\r\nThough Iyer had a location in mind, it was not marked on the blueprint. Thi=\r\ns\nturned out to be a benediction as Bhagavan selected the site and marked t=\r\nhe\nexact location. Later, one could see what a blessing it was; not only wa=\r\ns\nthe water as sweet as tender coconut water, but the well never ran dry an=\r\nd\nwas thus a source of succour for the entire neighbourhood in times of sev=\r\nere\ndrought.\n\nHis wife was a truly sattvic woman, given to dharmic ways and=\r\n scrupulously\nadhering to the sastraic injunctions pertaining to a housewif=\r\ne. She shared\nher husband=E2=80=99s ways and views completely. Though born =\r\nin a rich family, she\nhad no pretensions or airs about her. Simple, carefre=\r\ne and unattached, she\nran the household with a contented mind and to the sa=\r\ntisfaction of the\nentire family, making optimum use of the resources availa=\r\nble to her. The\nchildren, like the mother, were an uncomplaining lot and we=\r\nre content in\ndoing what they were told to do by their father.\n\nIyer=E2=80=\r\n=99s one passion was to chant Ulladu Narpadu unceasingly. Neither\nconventio=\r\nnal vedic duties nor extravagant ritualistic observances had any\nattraction=\r\n for him. The constant chanting of Ulladu Narpadu was all the\nreligious obs=\r\nervance known to him. It would start right from the morning.\n\nDyed in brahm=\r\ninical custom, Narayana Iyer looked forward to his invigorating\ncup of morn=\r\ning coffee. The person who milked the cow used to turn up at 5.00\na.m., ann=\r\nouncing his arrival by ringing his bicycle bell. Iyer, who would\ninvariably=\r\n be chanting Ulladu Narpadu loudly, would open the gate for him.\nThe day wo=\r\nuld, therefore, begin with Ulladu Narpadu, a routine so\npredictable and pun=\r\nctual, the neighbour opposite him, an Andhra lady,\nremarked that she could =\r\nsafely set her clock by his recitation in the\nmorning. His chanting continu=\r\ned throughout the day while he watered the\nplants or gave the cow a bath.\n\n=\r\nIf ever he were to hear a voice raised in argument among the children, he\nw=\r\nould simply raise his voice and chant even louder. It was a wonder to see\nt=\r\nhe children immediately quietened, as if the mesmerising spell of this\npowe=\r\nrful mantra made them aware of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s very presence.\n\nKanakamma=\r\nl stayed in Iyer=E2=80=99s compound, occupying a small cottage for nearly\nt=\r\nen years. He looked upon me as his own daughter. He always made himself\nawa=\r\nre of my requirements when he procured groceries for his own household\nand =\r\nwould always meet my needs.\n\nNarayana Iyer and Venkataratnam used to narrat=\r\ne to Kanakammal whatever\ntranspired in the hall during the nights and on da=\r\nys when Kanakammal was\nunable to attend.\n\nSubsequently Iyer was posted to P=\r\nolur, but he did not move his residence\nfrom Tiruvannamalai. Instead, he cy=\r\ncled to the station, left his cycle\nthere, took the train to Polur and agai=\r\nn cycled to his office from there.\nHis return in the evening was by the sam=\r\ne route, but like an arrow he would\nspeed his way directly to the ashram in=\r\n order to be with Bhagavan. He was\nlike a calf rushing to its mother. By th=\r\nen it would usually be 9:00 p.m.\n\nOne evening, as Iyer came from the statio=\r\nn, Bhagavan enquired whether he had\neaten his dinner.\n\n=E2=80=98Not yet Bha=\r\ngavan.=E2=80=99\n\nBhagavan, compassion incarnate, was filled with concern an=\r\nd said, =E2=80=98It is\nalready so late. Poor Lalitha will be waiting for yo=\r\nu. Just think how late\nit will be for her to go to bed after serving you di=\r\nnner, eating herself and\nthen completing the domestic chores. From now on g=\r\no home first, have your\ndinner and then come to the ashram.=E2=80=99\n\nThus =\r\nordered by Bhagavan, and also moved by his compassion, Iyer reached his\nhou=\r\nse and exclaimed to his wife, =E2=80=98How fortunate you are to be so graci=\r\nously\nremembered by Bhagavan, despite remaining within the house. From now =\r\non I\nwill have my dinner straight away when I come home from the station. P=\r\nlease\nhave it ready then.=E2=80=99\n\nSri Bhagavan had his head shaved once a=\r\n month on the full moon day. Natesan\nwas the barber who used to do this ser=\r\nvice. Bhagavan sat on a stool and\nNatesan would stand and shave him. Once S=\r\nri Bhagavan suggested to Natesan in\nall seriousness that it would be more c=\r\nomfortable for the barber to sit on\nthe stool while he himself would sit on=\r\n the floor!\n\nIt was past 8.30 one night when I came to the Ashram on one of=\r\n my visits.\nEveryone had retired to rest after the night meal. I went to th=\r\ne office.\nChinnaswamy was sitting in his place talking to some Ashramites. =\r\nWhen he saw\nme enter he said, =E2=80=9CNarayana Iyer, don=E2=80=99t go near=\r\n Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s couch.He is\nresting on the veranda near the well. H=\r\ne had a fracture of his collar bone\nand a plaster has been put on it. He sh=\r\nould not be disturbed. Prostrate at a\ndistance and come away noiselessly.=\r\n=E2=80=9D I was shocked to hear the news. If any\nother reason had been give=\r\nn it could have restrained me, but the mention of\na =E2=80=98fracture=E2=80=\r\n=99 made me eager and anxious to see Sri Bhagavan.\nI went on tiptoe and pro=\r\nstrated quietly. He evidently saw me and said,\n=E2=80=9CNarayana Iyer, come=\r\n, sit by my side on the couch.Only then can I see you\nand talk. Otherwise t=\r\nhe bandage they have put might be disturbed and there\nmight be pain.=E2=80=\r\n=9D Implicitly I obeyed when he said this, notwithstanding my\nfear of Chinn=\r\naswamy=E2=80=99s reaction if he should happen to see me there. He said,\n=E2=\r\n=80=9CI was going up the steps. A dog was chasing a squirrel. I barred its =\r\nway by\nputting my walking stick in front of it. The stick slipped and I fel=\r\nl down\nand got hurt on the collar bone. They say it is a fracture and the n=\r\native\nbone-setter of the village, an old devotee, was sent for. He has put =\r\nthis\nbandage with some green leaves and black gram paste and I am enjoined =\r\nnot to\nmove lest it be disturbed.=E2=80=9D\n\nHe narrated the incident as tho=\r\nugh it was someone else=E2=80=99s body that was\ninjured and was suffering!\n=\r\n\nAs Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana approached, Narayana Iyer never moved aw=\r\nay from\nthe vicinity of Bhagavan. He was a witness to all that went on duri=\r\nng those\nprecious last days. At that time Bhagavan=E2=80=99s water pot [kam=\r\nandalu] and\nwalking stick were in his room as he could not use them anymore=\r\n. Iyer sensed\nthat several people had secret designs on them, wanting to ta=\r\nke them away\nand preserve them as private, sacred relics. After the mahasam=\r\nadhi of\nBhagavan, abhishekam, alankaram and arathi were performed and the h=\r\noly body\nwas taken in procession in a small ratha around the Mother=E2=80=\r\n=99s Temple. Iyer\ntook this opportune moment, picked up the walking stick a=\r\nnd kamandalu, and\nslowly walked ahead of the ratha up to the samadhi chambe=\r\nr where Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\nbody would be enshrined. A small hand spun cloth=\r\n bag encasing Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\nearthly frame was filled with vibhuti and =\r\ncamphor according to scriptural\nprocedure. It was then reverently lowered i=\r\nnto the samadhi chamber. Iyer\nhimself descended into the chamber and placed=\r\n Bhagavan=E2=80=99s walking stick and\nkamandalu on either side of the body.=\r\n The samadhi pit was then slowly filled\nin. Anyone who nurtured hopes of ac=\r\nquiring Bhagavan=E2=80=99s meagre possessions as\nrelics was disappointed.\n\n=\r\nIn the aftermath of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana Iyer did not give up his=\r\n earlier\nroutine of having Bhagavan=E2=80=99s darshan daily. He had darshan=\r\n of Bhagavan at\nthe samadhi shrine and continued to visit the old hall. The=\r\n Iyers stayed on\nin Tiruvannamalai, as did Chadwick who, for a time, took u=\r\np residence in the\nIyer compound in a small thatched-roof cottage until he =\r\nwas invited by the\nashram management to move back there again. Iyer and Cha=\r\ndwick were spiritual\ncompanions, their uniting bond being the love and devo=\r\ntion they both had for\nBhagavan.\n\nLater, when all their children had settle=\r\nd in Madras, the Iyers, who were\nbeginning to feel their age, also moved th=\r\nere to be near their children and\ngrandchildren.\n\nNarayana Iyer and his wif=\r\ne were grihasta asrama [householders] and followed\nthat dharma meticulously=\r\n. Yet mentally both had donned ochre robes. Their\nlives, the way they lived=\r\n, was a penance [tapas] that required no other\nspiritual practice. Wherever=\r\n Iyer went, his continued recitation of Ulladu\nNarpadu made the air around =\r\nhim vibrant with the holy presence of Bhagavan,\ncompelling an inner respons=\r\ne from all.\n\nSources:\n\n1)\nhttp://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/07/r=\r\nemembering-sub-registrar-narayana-iyer.html\n2) Surpassing Love and Grace Bo=\r\nok\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd138d4db02490485323c10\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nNarayana Iyer was a devotee who came to scoff, but remained as a worshipper=\r\n.

He was well acquainted with Bha=\r\ngavan, being the son of Lakshmi Ammal of Tiruchuzhi, one of Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s childhood playmates. He invited Narayana Iyer to go with him to Tiruva=\r\nnnamalai during the Deepam festival, and his invitation was accepted, even =\r\nthough Narayana Iyer disliked crowds and temple festivals had no attraction=\r\n for him; he agreed on the condition that he would neither come inside the =\r\nashram nor prostrate to the swami if perchance he met him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nCircumstances forced him to accompany his friend into the ashram. As they w=\r\nere coming inside, a person clad only in a white loin cloth, a towel on his=\r\n shoulder, a kamandalu [water pot] in one hand and a walking stick in the o=\r\nther stopped in his walk in the opposite direction when he saw them. He spo=\r\nke kindly to the doctor and enquired about his mother and brother. Though I=\r\nyer guessed that this must be the Maharshi, he did not look up, thinking th=\r\nat, after all, he was a complete stranger to him. On being introduced as th=\r\ne Sub-registrar of Chetpet, out of courtesy he looked up. Let us hear him n=\r\now in his own words:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98What a wonderful face and what a wel=\r\ncoming smile! Bewitching, fascinating and a powerful look too! In a moment =\r\nI was at his feet on the gravel ground=E2=80=A6. He is not bogus=E2=80=A6. =\r\nlooks genuine=E2=80=A6. but has he solved the mystery of life, of the unive=\r\nrse that we see around us? If not, I withdraw my homage and go my way=E2=80=\r\n=A6. I tried to find out if he had written any books. I got a copy of Ullad=\r\nu Narpadu [Reality in Forty Verses] in Tamil. It had just been published.=\r\n=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As he tried to read the first stanza he was confounded a=\r\nnd filled with dismay at the repeated use of the word ulladu, which seemed =\r\ntoo closely packed. The pure language, embodying the essence of absolute re=\r\nality, would drive even pundits of Tamil prosody to despair. Someone nearby=\r\n said that the Maharshi himself would explain the forty verses that night. =\r\nIn anxious and eager suspense Narayana Iyer waited for the night.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;A solemn stillness pervaded the air. There was absolute silence. The =\r\nMaharshi read the first stanza. The mere reading of it made the meaning as =\r\nclear as clarity itself. Stanza by stanza he read and explained in a voice =\r\nso sweet and melodious, it seemed to come from a transcendent being.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;The climax came when he said, after explaining a verse, =E2=80=98God can=\r\nnot be seen with our eyes and known by our senses. This is what is meant by=\r\n saying, =E2=80=9C&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To see God is to be God=\r\n=E2=80=9D.&lt;/span&gt;=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It flashed upon Narayana Iyer instantly=\r\n that if He whom all religions acclaim as God were to appear before him in =\r\nflesh and blood, here He is. Successive waves of bliss flooding from within=\r\n shook his frame. He went out to compose himself.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He says, =E2=80=\r\n=98I came, he saw, he conquered=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spell was thus cast. H=\r\nenceforth Bhagavan was his God. Bhagavan was the way and the support on the=\r\n way as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Narayana Iyer the content of Ulladu Narpadu became =\r\na vedic truth and its verses veritable mantras. He took to chanting them as=\r\n japa. From then on nothing could stop him from frequenting the ashram.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;His job entailed frequent transfers; he was successively posted to Ar=\r\nani, Polur, and Shankagiri (Salem) for varying periods. However, there was =\r\nno let up in his regular visits.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Neve=\r\nr a Sunday passed without Narayana Iyer arriving at the ashram. He always h=\r\nad some delectable snacks with him which were prepared by his wife Lalitha =\r\nIyer, who believed that she was cooking delicacies for God.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0The=\r\nse were savoured by everyone as Bhagavan would never accept anything unless=\r\n there was enough for all. Very often Iyer would bring omappodi, [a snack m=\r\nade of gram flour and spices] which Bhagavan appears to have been quite fon=\r\nd of, and occasionally he would bring other items in quantities that would =\r\nsuffice for all in the hall.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once=\r\n when Shantammal enquired of Bhagavan whether she could prepare some snacks=\r\n in the ashram, Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=98Tomorrow is Sunday. Narayana Iye=\r\nr will be arriving and will surely be bringing something to eat.=E2=80=99&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Such was the certainty of his arrival and of the snacks that came w=\r\nith him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In those days [the early thirties] the area surround=\r\ning the ashram was very bare, with no trees or shrubs. The Mother=E2=80=99s=\r\n Temple was yet to be constructed. Anyone approaching the precincts of the =\r\nashram could be easily seen from the old hall. Once, between two successive=\r\n weekend visits by Narayana Iyer, the ashram administration, feeling that B=\r\nhagavan needed some rest in the afternoon after lunch, imposed a restrictio=\r\nn that no one would be allowed to disturb him between 12 noon and 2 p.m. Ne=\r\nither Bhagavan nor Narayana Iyer was aware of this new decree. The followin=\r\ng Sunday afternoon, as usual, Iyer arrived with omappodi in hand. As he app=\r\nroached the hall those strategically positioned to deflect the would-be vis=\r\nitors until 2 pm, the new receiving hour, apprised him of the rule. Iyer, t=\r\nhough still at a great distance from Bhagavan, made his customary prostrati=\r\non from where he was, retraced his steps and waited until the appointed hou=\r\nr.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;At 2 p.m. he came before Bhagavan. Bhagavan had spied him on hi=\r\ns arrival and noted his subsequent disappearance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As soon as he ente=\r\nred the hall Bhagavan asked him, =E2=80=98Didn=E2=80=99t you come at 1 o=E2=\r\n=80=99clock? I saw you arriving through the window and was expecting you to=\r\n come to the hall at any moment. But you didn=E2=80=99t come. Did you have =\r\nto go elsewhere?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Naraya=\r\nna Iyer, who had no idea that Bhagavan was not supposed to know of the new =\r\narrangement, replied in all innocence, =E2=80=98My train arrived late and I=\r\n could come only at 1 o=E2=80=99clock. I was informed that Bhagavan nowaday=\r\ns rests in the afternoons and is not to be disturbed until 2 p.m. That=E2=\r\n=80=99s why I have only come in now.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan listened wi=\r\nthout any comment, other than his customary, =E2=80=98Oh! Is that so?=E2=80=\r\n=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The next day after lunch=\r\n, instead of going into the hall, Bhagavan sat outside the hall. The attend=\r\nant very hesitantly suggested that he go inside, as it was becoming very ho=\r\nt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan said, =E2=80=\r\n=98Nobody is allowed to enter until 2 p.m. Is there also a rule that I shou=\r\nld not sit here until two?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Bhagavan, the very embodime=\r\nnt of compassion added, =E2=80=98People come from far-away places by variou=\r\ns means, suffering innumerable hardships in order to get here. How can they=\r\n be sure of the exact time of their arrival? When they come after all that =\r\ntrouble, how fair is it to deny them ready access?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Hearin=\r\ng this, the management immediately revoked the new rule.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In d=\r\nue course, owing to the profound grace of Bhagavan, Narayana Iyer was poste=\r\nd to Tiruvannamalai itself. He was the first in a long line of devotees to =\r\nhave had the rare privilege of establishing a residence near the ashram in =\r\norder to be in the holy presence of Bhagavan on a regular basis. His entire=\r\n sadhana comprised of simply remaining with Bhagavan whenever possible, in =\r\nthe hall or in the kitchen, cutting vegetables, grinding chutney and prepar=\r\ning breakfast in the wee hours of the morning. On any given morning the tri=\r\no of G. V. Subbaramayya, Kalyana Sundaram Iyer of the bookstall and Narayan=\r\na Iyer, would be found with Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One year, due to an unusual =\r\nspell of drought, the ashram faced severe water scarcity on the eve of Jaya=\r\nnthi. The devotees, organising themselves into a long chain, passed vessels=\r\n filled with water from hand to hand from the Agasthya Teertham in Palakoth=\r\nu to the kitchen. Narayana Iyer very enthusiastically participated in this =\r\ncollective endeavour.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An extensive area of twenty grounds [one acr=\r\ne] was the site of Narayana Iyer=E2=80=99s residence where he grew a variet=\r\ny of fruit trees and fodder for his cow. Whatever wild creatures found in t=\r\nhat area were left to themselves. Occasionally, he had snakes caught and re=\r\nleased in isolated spots on the mountain.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Prior to constructing th=\r\ne house, Iyer took the plans to Bhagavan to have them blessed. After carefu=\r\nl perusal Bhagavan observed, =E2=80=98The plan is all right, but where is t=\r\nhe well?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Iyer had a location in mind, it was not mar=\r\nked on the blueprint. This turned out to be a benediction as Bhagavan selec=\r\nted the site and marked the exact location. Later, one could see what a ble=\r\nssing it was; not only was the water as sweet as tender coconut water, but =\r\nthe well never ran dry and was thus a source of succour for the entire neig=\r\nhbourhood in times of severe drought.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;His wife was a truly sattvic woman, given to dharmic ways and scrupulo=\r\nusly adhering to the sastraic injunctions pertaining to a housewife. She sh=\r\nared her husband=E2=80=99s ways and views completely. Though born in a rich=\r\n family, she had no pretensions or airs about her. Simple, carefree and una=\r\nttached, she ran the household with a contented mind and to the satisfactio=\r\nn of the entire family, making optimum use of the resources available to he=\r\nr. The children, like the mother, were an uncomplaining lot and were conten=\r\nt in doing what they were told to do by their father.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Iyer=\r\n=E2=80=99s one passion was to chant Ulladu Narpadu unceasingly. Neither con=\r\nventional vedic duties nor extravagant ritualistic observances had any attr=\r\naction for him. The constant chanting of Ulladu Narpadu was all the religio=\r\nus observance known to him. It would start right from the morning.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Dyed in brahminical custom, Narayana Iyer=\r\n looked forward to his invigorating cup of morning coffee. The person who m=\r\nilked the cow used to turn up at 5.00 a.m., announcing his arrival by ringi=\r\nng his bicycle bell. Iyer, who would invariably be chanting Ulladu Narpadu =\r\nloudly, would open the gate for him. The day would, therefore, begin with U=\r\nlladu Narpadu, a routine so predictable and punctual, the neighbour opposit=\r\ne him, an Andhra lady, remarked that she could safely set her clock by his =\r\nrecitation in the morning. His chanting continued throughout the day while =\r\nhe watered the plants or gave the cow a bath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If ever he we=\r\nre to hear a voice raised in argument among the children, he would simply r=\r\naise his voice and chant even louder. It was a wonder to see the children i=\r\nmmediately quietened, as if the mesmerising spell of this powerful mantra m=\r\nade them aware of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s very presence.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Kanakammal sta=\r\nyed in Iyer=E2=80=99s compound, occupying a small cottage for nearly ten ye=\r\nars. He looked upon me as his own daughter. He always made himself aware of=\r\n my requirements when he procured groceries for his own household and would=\r\n always meet my needs.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Narayana Iyer and Venkataratnam used to nar=\r\nrate to Kanakammal whatever transpired in the hall during the nights and on=\r\n days when Kanakammal was unable to attend.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Subsequently Iyer was posted to Polur, but he did not move h=\r\nis residence from Tiruvannamalai. Instead, he cycled to the station, left h=\r\nis cycle there, took the train to Polur and again cycled to his office from=\r\n there. His return in the evening was by the same route, but like an arrow =\r\nhe would speed his way directly to the ashram in order to be with Bhagavan.=\r\n He was like a calf rushing to its mother. By then it would usually be 9:00=\r\n p.m.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One evening, as Iyer came from the station, Bhagavan enquire=\r\nd whether he had eaten his dinner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98Not yet Bhagavan.=E2=80=\r\n=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan, compassion incarnate, was filled with concern and said=\r\n, =E2=80=98It is already so late. Poor Lalitha will be waiting for you. Jus=\r\nt think how late it will be for her to go to bed after serving you dinner, =\r\neating herself and then completing the domestic chores. From now on go home=\r\n first, have your dinner and then come to the ashram.=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Thus ordered by Bhagavan, and also mo=\r\nved by his compassion, Iyer reached his house and exclaimed to his wife, =\r\n=E2=80=98How fortunate you are to be so graciously remembered by Bhagavan, =\r\ndespite remaining within the house. From now on I will have my dinner strai=\r\nght away when I come home from the station. Please have it ready then.=E2=\r\n=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sri Bhagavan had hi=\r\ns head shaved once a month on the full moon day. Natesan was the barber who=\r\n used to do this service. Bhagavan sat on a stool and Natesan would stand a=\r\nnd shave him. Once Sri Bhagavan suggested to Natesan in all seriousness tha=\r\nt it would be more comfortable for the barber to sit on the stool while he =\r\nhimself would sit on the floor!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It was past 8.30 one night =\r\nwhen I came to the Ashram on one of my visits. Everyone had retired to rest=\r\n after the night meal. I went to the office. Chinnaswamy was sitting in his=\r\n place talking to some Ashramites. When he saw me enter he said, =E2=80=9CN=\r\narayana Iyer, don=E2=80=99t go near Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s couch.He is rest=\r\ning on the veranda near the well. He had a fracture of his collar bone and =\r\na plaster has been put on it. He should not be disturbed. Prostrate at a di=\r\nstance and come away noiselessly.=E2=80=9D I was shocked to hear the news. =\r\nIf any other reason had been given it could have restrained me, but the men=\r\ntion of a =E2=80=98fracture=E2=80=99 made me eager and anxious to see Sri B=\r\nhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\nI went on tiptoe and prostrated quietly. He evidently saw me =\r\nand said, =E2=80=9CNarayana Iyer, come, sit by my side on the couch.Only th=\r\nen can I see you and talk. Otherwise the bandage they have put might be dis=\r\nturbed and there might be pain.=E2=80=9D Implicitly I obeyed when he said t=\r\nhis, notwithstanding my fear of Chinnaswamy=E2=80=99s reaction if he should=\r\n happen to see me there. He said, =E2=80=9CI was going up the steps. A dog =\r\nwas chasing a squirrel. I barred its way by putting my walking stick in fro=\r\nnt of it. The stick slipped and I fell down and got hurt on the collar bone=\r\n. They say it is a fracture and the native bone-setter of the village, an o=\r\nld devotee, was sent for. He has put this bandage with some green leaves an=\r\nd black gram paste and I am enjoined not to move lest it be disturbed.=E2=\r\n=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He narrated the incident a=\r\ns though it was someone else=E2=80=99s body that was injured and was suffer=\r\ning!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana approached, Narayana I=\r\nyer never moved away from the vicinity of Bhagavan. He was a witness to all=\r\n that went on during those precious last days. At that time Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s water pot [kamandalu] and walking stick were in his room as he could n=\r\not use them anymore. Iyer sensed that several people had secret designs on =\r\nthem, wanting to take them away and preserve them as private, sacred relics=\r\n. After the mahasamadhi of Bhagavan, abhishekam, alankaram and arathi were =\r\nperformed and the holy body was taken in procession in a small ratha around=\r\n the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple. Iyer took this opportune moment, picked up th=\r\ne walking stick and kamandalu, and slowly walked ahead of the ratha up to t=\r\nhe samadhi chamber where Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body would be enshrined. A smal=\r\nl hand spun cloth bag encasing Bhagavan=E2=80=99s earthly frame was filled =\r\nwith vibhuti and camphor according to scriptural procedure. It was then rev=\r\nerently lowered into the samadhi chamber. Iyer himself descended into the c=\r\nhamber and placed Bhagavan=E2=80=99s walking stick and kamandalu on either =\r\nside of the body. The samadhi pit was then slowly filled in. Anyone who nur=\r\ntured hopes of acquiring Bhagavan=E2=80=99s meagre possessions as relics wa=\r\ns disappointed.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the aftermath of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mahanirvana=\r\n Iyer did not give up his earlier routine of having Bhagavan=E2=80=99s dars=\r\nhan daily. He had darshan of Bhagavan at the samadhi shrine and continued t=\r\no visit the old hall. The Iyers stayed on in Tiruvannamalai, as did Chadwic=\r\nk who, for a time, took up residence in the Iyer compound in a small thatch=\r\ned-roof cottage until he was invited by the ashram management to move back =\r\nthere again. Iyer and Chadwick were spiritual companions, their uniting bon=\r\nd being the love and devotion they both had for Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Later, w=\r\nhen all their children had settled in Madras, the Iyers, who were beginning=\r\n to feel their age, also moved there to be near their children and grandchi=\r\nldren.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Narayana Iyer and his wife w=\r\nere grihasta asrama [householders] and followed that dharma meticulously. Y=\r\net mentally both had donned ochre robes. Their lives, the way they lived, w=\r\nas a penance [tapas] that required no other spiritual practice. Wherever Iy=\r\ner went, his continued recitation of Ulladu Narpadu made the air around him=\r\n vibrant with the holy presence of Bhagavan, compelling an inner response f=\r\nrom all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/span&gt;:=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/07=\r\n/remembering-sub-registrar-narayana-iyer.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://sri=\r\n-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/07/remembering-sub-registrar-narayana-iy=\r\ner.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n2) Surpassing Love and Grace Book&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=\r\n=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd138d4db02490485323c10--\r\n\n"}}
