C=\r\nlairvoyants claim\n&gt; to report deeper color auras around spiritual practitio=\r\nners although they\n&gt; also claim that a highly evolved spiritual person woul=\r\nd have a white or a\n&gt; light pink aura\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.

T=\r\nhere is no universal standard of the interpretation of energy\n&gt; visualizati=\r\non. As an example, one person may associate spirituality with\n&gt; blue wherea=\r\ns another &quot;energy sensitive&quot; may associate white.

I would recommend that you get a cou=\r\nple of books on auras and learn more\n&gt; about energies and colors and they e=\r\nven have some exercises to develop this\n&gt; siddhi further.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. Most impor=\r\ntantly, as Narasimha says, don&#39;t get mesmerized by the scenery\n&gt; along the =\r\nway and lose sight of the destination. If you are attaining a\n&gt; siddhi, kno=\r\nwingly or unknowingly, then use this to get closer to the divine\n&gt; and ask =\r\nhim/her for guidance so that this may be used for the welfare for\n&gt; which i=\r\nt is intended.
