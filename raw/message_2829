At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a p=\r\nowerful divine presence.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar=\r\n hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;=\r\ns place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places.=\r\n There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example=\r\n, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Daks=\r\nhineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalig=\r\nhat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There was one sm=\r\nall temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to vis=\r\nit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homa=\r\nm in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed lik=\r\ne a small temple. The name of the=C3=82=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand i=\r\nt. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and star=\r\nted meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a visi=\r\non of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt th=\r\nat there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember th=\r\ne name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over th=\r\ne goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the r=\r\noof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that th=\r\ne goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and\n&gt;  lef=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil N=\r\nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presenc=\r\ne across India.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshin=\r\neshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitth=\r\nal temple at Aalandi near Pune.

These western countries =\r\nare so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there =\r\nis a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good =\r\nplace to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* tem=\r\nples. But some temples are really good.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If one has a c=\r\nhance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I sugges=\r\nt the following:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kama=\r\nkhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0and Narayana=C3=82=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C3=82=C2=A0in south India,=\r\n Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C3=82=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in wes=\r\nt India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam an=\r\nd Mantralayam=C3=82=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThere are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a=\r\n temple once is one thing and staying there for several months while mainta=\r\nining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam=\r\n) there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http:/=\r\n/groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Hol=\r\ny Places\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in to=\r\nday&#39;s time.
