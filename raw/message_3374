People there nam=\r\ned it Basava,\ndecorated it nicely and took a photo of it along with Sri Sam=\r\nbasiva Iyer who\nhad accompanied it. Sambasiva Iyer returned with a copy of =\r\nthe photo besides\nan old fashioned silk-fringed shawl, some vibhuti, kumkum=\r\n and prasad 1 given\nto him by the temple authorities.\n\nDue to the great cro=\r\nwd of visitors since August 15th, Bhagavan has been\nspending the days out i=\r\nn the Jubilee Hall.\n\nSambasiva Iyer came into Bhagavan=E2=80=99s presence w=\r\nith the shawl, vibhuti, etc.,\non a large plate. The brahmins who had accomp=\r\nanied him recited a mantra\nwhile all of us prostrated before Bhagavan, then=\r\n rose. Looking at me,\nBhagavan said, =E2=80=9COur bull has been sent to the=\r\n Meenakshi Temple, did you\nknow?=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CYes, I knew,=E2=80=9D I =\r\nsaid. =E2=80=9COn the day it was going, I saw it decorated\nwith turmeric, 2=\r\n kumkum, etc. and came to know of the purpose when I asked\nthe cattle-keepe=\r\nr.=E2=80=9DHolding the plate reverentially and smearing the vibhuti\nand kum=\r\nkum on his forehead, Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CSee, this is Meenakshi=E2=80=\r\n=99s gift.=E2=80=9D\nAnd his voice quivered as he said it.\n\nSambasiva Iyer s=\r\npread the shawl over Bhagavan=E2=80=99s feet, and when Bhagavan,\ndeeply mov=\r\ned, removed it with evident feeling of reverence, the attendants\ntook it an=\r\nd spread it over the back of the sofa. Adjusting the shawl\nproperly with hi=\r\ns hands, Bhagavan, looking towards us, said, =E2=80=9CMother 1\nVibhuti: sac=\r\nred ash. Kumkum: vermilion powder. Prasad: any flower or food\nconsecrated b=\r\ny being offered to the Deity.\n\n2 Turmeric: a bright yellow powder of the tu=\r\nrmeric root.\n\nMeenakshi has sent this. It is Mother=E2=80=99s gift.=E2=80=\r\n=9D And, choked with emotion, he\nwas unable to say more and became silent.\n=\r\n\nHis eyes were full of tears of joy and his body became motionless. Seeing\n=\r\nthis, it seemed to me that Nature herself had become silent. When, as a boy=\r\n,\nBhagavan was in Tiruchuli and someone had been angry with him, he had gon=\r\ne\nto the temple and wept, sitting behind the image of Sahayamba.\n\nHe alone =\r\nknows how the Mother consoled him and what hopes she gave him.\n\nThree years=\r\n ago, the Ashram doctor said that hand- pounded rice would be\ngood for Bhag=\r\navan=E2=80=99s health.\n\nThereupon the Ashramites approached Bhagavan with a=\r\n request to take such\nrice, which would be specially cooked for him. When B=\r\nhagavan asked them\nwhether the same rice would be served to all, they said =\r\nthat it would not be\npossible, as the supply of such rice was limited. Bhag=\r\navan therefore would\nnot agree to having it however much they tried to pers=\r\nuade him. At last they\nsaid that they would use the hand- pounded rice for =\r\nthe daily offerings to\nthe deity in the temple, for which rice is usually c=\r\nooked separately and\nthey requested Bhagavan to partake of that rice. =E2=\r\n=80=9CIf that is so, it is all\nright.\n\nI will take it because it is Mother=\r\n=E2=80=99s prasadam,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.\n\nAnd from that day onwards, th=\r\ney have been cooking hand- pounded rice\nseparately and, after offering it t=\r\no the goddess in the temple, have been\nserving it to Bhagavan, giving what =\r\nwas left over to all others in his\ncompany.\n\nLast summer, Ramaswami Iyer=E2=\r\n=80=99s son got married and for the occasion there was\na feast here. That d=\r\nay, Iyer noticed that there was white rice on the leaves\nof all, whereas th=\r\ne rice on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s leaf was reddish, and he enquired the\nreason. =\r\nBhagavan smiling, said, =E2=80=9CThis is Mother=E2=80=99s prasadam.\n\nWhat i=\r\ns wrong with it? It is cooked specially as an offering to Mother.=E2=80=9D =\r\nHe\nthen related the above incident.
