What this namboodiri did is the correct way.\n\nVisualize t=\r\nhe external fire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it=\r\n will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong =\r\nyour identification is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone hand=\r\nles that external fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submit=\r\nted by that person to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of=\r\n karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like=\r\n husband and wife or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on =\r\nkarmas from the entire world if you are ready and willing to face their con=\r\nsequences, but a person with a strong individualized ego should limit the k=\r\narmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very s=\r\nubtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas and face their consequence=\r\ns. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small=\r\n plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very\n big, it can give=\r\n flowers and fruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, ke=\r\nep working to burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental =\r\nconditioning) caused by them.\n\nBut some people use fire in the same way an =\r\nidol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle th=\r\ne fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s i=\r\nnternal fire with external fire does such things, it can be disastrous. How=\r\never, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not understand much =\r\nabout fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire =\r\nis practically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as m=\r\nuch as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offeri=\r\nngs into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n\nThe =\r\nbest approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you mak=\r\ne offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (b=\r\nhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a str=\r\nong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will b=\r\necome strong and burn various vaasanas.\n\n(2) There are different methods fo=\r\nr beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usuall=\r\ny standard. Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to or =\r\nwhat you are more attracted to.\n\nAs I said many times, these nyaasas are ju=\r\nst formality for most people. Placing a letter in a particular body part ha=\r\ns a higher significance than just tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a=\r\n specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after =\r\none makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So ther=\r\ne is no point in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you=\r\n that this will not block you.\n\n(3) They should be shown in the video.

Request you to kindly answer them for me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) During some homams performed at my home, I have seen the Vadhy=\r\nar (priest) ask my mother to light the homam fire during the agni invocatio=\r\nn. I am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when we had a namboothiri pe=\r\nrform the homam he would\n light the homam fire himself. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My questio=\r\nn is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam fire or do it myself ?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically the glaam =\r\nbeejam , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to touch th=\r\ne heart , then right and left breasts respectively whereas in the video you=\r\n have shown it to be heart , navel and below respctively. Is the beejam , s=\r\nhakthih and kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet for each diety ? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; 3) There are 4 more avhana mudras for suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava=\r\n, varado bhava, sarvAbhIshTaprado bhava. The manual does not talks about th=\r\nese mudras. Kindly let me know if these are imporatnt and how to show these=\r\n mudras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks and regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Girish Sundaram&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow\n ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hours i=\r\ns far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday. It is like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; fasting everyday and eating a 30-course meal once every few months vs e=\r\nating &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dal and rice everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, your request is good and I will try to create a long procedure &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; manual atleast for Mahaganapathi homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2=\r\n) I have all of them in mind. Purusha sookta homam is the simplest homam &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; and very useful for spiritual progress. I do have that in mind.=\r\n Sudarsana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam can also be done on a regular\n basis quickly=\r\n. But navagraha homam is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; more time-consuming.
