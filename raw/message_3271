Again as you already know, Shudra\n&gt; was not B.C., OBC, KBC, HS=\r\nBC etc.. :-). but a fallen man, a mean\n&gt; thinking man. I have to agree if y=\r\nou say that Ganvaar and Shudra can\n&gt; also be said about Woaman however look=\r\ning at the Doha and general\n&gt; prevailing conditions of society, it seems th=\r\nat he used those words for\n&gt; Men.\n&gt; \n&gt; Grammar...Hmmmm. i don&#39;t know if he =\r\nhas really used proper grammer in\n&gt; such Dohas.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are verse in Bha=\r\ngvad Gita which can be criticised by people from\n&gt; other faiths if they are=\r\n taken literaly and without understanding\n&gt; personality of Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; **=\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding Ramachandra, Thank you for making clear, your notable frie=\r\nnd&#39;s\n&gt; view and your detailed explanation by giving examples.

Let me try again. He is not rea=\r\nlly saying\n&gt; that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agr=\r\nees that\n&gt; Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinio=\r\nn)=C2\n&gt; God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He desce=\r\nnded\n&gt; in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+aya=\r\nna.\n&gt; A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of\n&gt; principle=\r\ns.=C2  Compare this to the name of the other great epic,\n&gt; Mahabharata, whi=\r\nch was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot;. One cannot follow\n&gt; Krishna&#39;s path.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our\n&gt;=\r\n subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper\n&gt; a=\r\nnd the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama\n&gt; di=\r\nd. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel\n&gt; ma=\r\nn, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a\n&gt; lif=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the\n=\r\n&gt; life of a great man.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, even today lot of people advi=\r\nse that one should try to\n&gt; become like Vivekananda, or that this country n=\r\needs its youth to be like\n&gt; Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean Viv=\r\nekanada was not a self\n&gt; realized=C2 saint of highest calibre, but his life=\r\n&#39;s image is like=C2\n&gt; one who=C2 lived like a lion among sheep of ordinary=\r\n=C2 men, fearless\n&gt; and uncompromising and principled. If every=C2 person w=\r\nould constantly\n&gt; think that Vivekanada was a saint=C2 who worked by the pw=\r\noer of a deity\n&gt; or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a gr=\r\neat guru,=C2\n&gt; no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C2=\r\n emulate\n&gt; his way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C2 the i=\r\nmage he\n&gt; projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can ins=\r\npire\n&gt; people.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; =C2 On the other hand=C2 you will never hear any=\r\none advising that\n&gt; one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=C2 =C2 =\r\nThat is\n&gt; impossible. He=C2  was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C2\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C2 Ramachandra\n&gt; =\r\nincomparison to Sri Krishna.

It is und=\r\nerstandable\n&gt; if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such=\r\n a great\n&gt; person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is=\r\n the\n&gt; definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated\n&gt; debat=\r\ne with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are\n&gt; all the=\r\noritical/ theological debates - nothing to do with actual\n&gt; spirituality. F=\r\ninally he stopped the debate because I was getting\n&gt; agitated and it would =\r\nhave affected our friendship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever his opinion is=\r\n asked on anything, he will only mention that\n&gt; what he can support using l=\r\nogic. Therefore he never generally discusses\n&gt; spirituality with anyone per=\r\n se. He will discuss and debate scriptures\n&gt; using exact quotations etc, (t=\r\nheology)=C3=82=C2 but not about mysticism or\n&gt; sadhana or anything which=C3=\r\n=82=C2 needs a belief system. That is why most\n&gt; people know him only as a =\r\nvery rational, massively knowledgeable and\n&gt; uncorruptable=C3=82=C2 human b=\r\neing.=C3=82=C2 =C3=82=C2 They have no clue about\n&gt; his meditations or anyth=\r\ning. He never projects himself as spiritual and\n&gt; generally would not discu=\r\nss God in public.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore our discussion was also o=\r\nn those aspects which can be\n&gt; proved or disproved theologically=C3=82=C2 -=\r\n 1) Is Rama a God as per\n&gt; Valmiki Ramayana=C3=82=C2  2) Is it wrong if peo=\r\nple consider him as\n&gt; God=C3=82=C2 .. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas =\r\nof Tulasidasji.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) To the first question, he believes=\r\n the answer is &quot;no&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) To the second question he say=\r\ns it cannot be debated from a\n&gt; spiritual point if it is right or wrong=C3=\r\n=82=C2 - but his personal\n&gt; opinion is that one should try to follow the wa=\r\ny of life shown by Sri\n&gt; Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Ram=\r\na had mastery of all\n&gt; divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and h=\r\nis whole army in a\n&gt; blink of an eye, right from the place where he was=C3=\r\n=82=C2 located when\n&gt; he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama=\r\n did not do so and\n&gt; instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the =\r\nhuman way. So as\n&gt; per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s id=\r\neas than to\n&gt; worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramch=\r\narit Manas, from a literary angle, a\n&gt; hodgepodge of langauges and styles r=\r\nanging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An\n&gt; author&#39;s paradise (since many rules o=\r\nf composition has been flouted) but\n&gt; a critics nightmare. Also, there is a=\r\n line in there which equates women\n&gt; with animals or something similar. He =\r\nbelieves that was introduces in\n&gt; the text because Tulasidas had a problem =\r\ncontrolling his own lust.\n&gt; Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence der=\r\nogatory to women.\n&gt; Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as Go=\r\nd, then the\n&gt; purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to e=\r\nxplain idea\n&gt; way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krish=\r\nna was\n&gt; maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than=\r\n\n&gt; Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The above=\r\n are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One request, if you can spea=\r\nk to him about his thought on Food\n&gt; habits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy myself.=\r\n\n&gt; But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respond.

I met him about two years back. What first\n&gt; attracted me to=C3=82=C2 =\r\n towards him was his impeccable honestly. I mean,\n&gt; he is a maniac=C3=82=C2=\r\n when it comes to=C3=82=C2 honestly.=C3=82=C2 If\n&gt; someone were to put a gu=\r\nn to his head and ask him to just say a simple,\n&gt; harmless=C3=82=C2 lie, li=\r\nke sun rises in the west, he would not say it.\n&gt; Therefore he never jokes w=\r\nith anyone too! He has actually never\n&gt; ever=C3=82=C2 spoken even a single =\r\nlie in his whole life, big or small.\n&gt; When he was in his school, once his =\r\nteacher told him that Indian\n&gt; languages are richer than English, he believ=\r\ned his teacher. Later\n&gt; someone else told him English is more comprehensive=\r\n language and the\n&gt; world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that da=\r\ny, he bought\n&gt; himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi a=\r\nnd for ten\n&gt; years every day he spend one hour reading the\n&gt; &gt; English dict=\r\nionary and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=\r\n=C3=82=C2 up\n&gt; volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=82=C2 When I ask=\r\ned him why, he\n&gt; just said it is because he wanted to be=C3=82=C2 equally a=\r\ndept at both the\n&gt; languages so that one day he can take a really detached =\r\nview to judge\n&gt; the truth about=C3=82=C2 which is more comprehensive langua=\r\nge! As I said,\n&gt; he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding=\r\n out the truth\n&gt; about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. =\r\nHe has worked\n&gt; in different fields, from banking to education to journalis=\r\nm. He did not\n&gt; last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently=\r\n, English,\n&gt; Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now h=\r\ne is\n&gt; learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When =\r\nhe\n&gt; was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a=\r\n\n&gt; job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk\n=\r\n&gt; who was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space,\n&gt; &gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.\n&gt; Seein=\r\ng this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up\n&gt; right t=\r\nhere. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu\n&gt; in the =\r\nform would have been a lie.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So this gives a basic ide=\r\na of the man I am speaking of. All his\n&gt; friends, whoever knows him, calls =\r\nhim Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was goin=\r\ng to office for some urgent meeting.\n&gt; His way to office passed by a Krishn=\r\na temple. As he was passing by\n&gt; in=C3=82=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt =\r\na strange urge to go into the\n&gt; temple. He says he still does not know why =\r\nhe went inside the temple,\n&gt; but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morni=\r\nng. Next when he sees his\n&gt; watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no =\r\nknowledge of how the time\n&gt; went. When he asked the priest, the priest said=\r\n that he went into the\n&gt; temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the =\r\nwhole time without any\n&gt; movement. The priest somehow felt scared to distur=\r\nb him. But my friend\n&gt; had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing=\r\n, as if he was in\n&gt; deep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then he started medit=\r\nating at home, and it was there=C3=82=C2 that he\n&gt; got visions etc of Krish=\r\nna. He does not say much about these, infact\n&gt; most people who know him als=\r\no do not know these things. But once he was\n&gt; in samadhi for 72 hours, not =\r\nmoving from his meditation seat, in the\n&gt; exact same place and same positio=\r\nn for 3 days continuously.=C3=82=C2  Only\n&gt; his wife and close relatives kn=\r\now about this incident. I believe\n&gt; nowadays when ever he sits for meditati=\r\non he often enters the state of\n&gt; Samadhi. When someone asked him how he fe=\r\nlt during samadhi, he just said\n&gt; it feels as if the whole universe orginat=\r\nes from me. I am the sun, the\n&gt; moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, =\r\nmen, women, children, the\n&gt; wind, the water, the space, smaller than the at=\r\nom and bigger than\n&gt; everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=82=C2=\r\n He considers Sri\n&gt; Krishna to be God and=C3=82=C2 Lord Rama to be the idea=\r\nl man.That is why\n&gt; he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks=\r\n it elevated\n&gt; &gt; Sri=C3=82=C2 Rama to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of a God whereas the =\r\naim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was\n&gt; to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=\r\n=C3=82=C2 not a God.The difference he\n&gt; says is that, an ideal man is someo=\r\nne who can be emulated, an ordinary\n&gt; man can and should aim to become like=\r\n the ideal. But a God cannot be\n&gt; emulated by ordinary men. One cannot beco=\r\nme Krishna, but one=C3=82=C2 can\n&gt; try to lead his life like Rama. I have a=\r\nrgued with him over this, but I\n&gt; am merely stating his idea. Also he does =\r\nnot have a Guru - a human guru\n&gt; at least, and advises people to not trust =\r\nmost Gurus these days.\n&gt; Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later he had once=C3=82=C2 mentioned he knew the relati=\r\non he had with\n&gt; all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he=\r\n says, was his\n&gt; daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of=\r\n time on\n&gt; different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C3=\r\n=82=C2 with\n&gt; those in=C3=82=C2 the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anyth=\r\ning and\n&gt; everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, rel=\r\nigion,\n&gt; etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who=\r\n will\n&gt; be the future of this country.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He is am omniv=\r\norous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not asked =\r\nhis\n&gt; permission before mentioning him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I would not like this mail to be=\r\n considered as a part of the\n&gt; debate.
