Or can I do it for the Rishi of \nmy Got=\r\nra and do it more number of times at one sitting?\n\n3) I am planning to do o=\r\nnly the Rishi and Dev tarpana, is that ok? \nAlso after saying the mantras, =\r\nand it is finished what to do with \nthe water pot and durvas?\n\n4) Seamease =\r\nseeds should be used only for pitri tarpan or also for \nRIshi and Deva tarp=\r\nan?\n\n5) In the deva tarpan can I take the name of my Devata for tarpan?\n\n-R=\r\negards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n"}}
