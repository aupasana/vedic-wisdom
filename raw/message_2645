You jump into the water, just move your hands and leg=\r\ns and there you go. A teacher cannot teach you. You have to jump and discov=\r\ner it yourself&quot;. It seems so easy and natural to him, but not for one who c=\r\nannot swim. If one just jumps into water and starts moving hands and legs, =\r\none may even drown!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though a swimming instructor cannot ensure that y=\r\nou learn swimming in a specific time period or that you become an expert in=\r\n swimming, he can engage in practices that maximize the probability of you =\r\nlearning swimming successfully oneday. He can also stop you from drowning i=\r\nn the beginning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is true that there is no formula to ensure self-r=\r\nealization in a specific time period. One can look at self-realization as a=\r\n happy accident that just happens. However, rishis and seers gave many ways=\r\n and factors that increase the probability of that accident considerably. G=\r\nuidance from a good guru will also increase the probability of that acciden=\r\nt considerably. However, even a good guru cannot ensure realization. One ca=\r\nn only maximize its chance.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aadi Shankara i=\r\ns so correct and wise in saying that a guru is the tiger in a dream who awa=\r\nkens you from the world of dreams. The tiger may just be a dream object and=\r\n unreal, but, one would stay in the dream much longer if not for the tiger =\r\nroaring in the dream!! Similarly, a guru is just imaginary. All that exists=\r\n is god and the tendency to see different people/obejects (instead of seein=\r\ng all as god and only god) is like imagining various dream objects. So guru=\r\n, friend, enemy, wife, son etc are all detailed imaginations of the mind an=\r\nd all that exists is god. However, one will be stuck in this long dream cal=\r\nled samsaara (wordly life), if the tiger called guru does not appear and ro=\r\nar. A beautiful and highly meaningful analogy!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; The use of gurus who are pretentious, gurus who have not realized thems=\r\nelves, gurus who have pride, gurus who have selfish agendas and gurus with =\r\na bloated sense of self-importance, is very limited. However, please rememb=\r\ner that even such gurus can be of immense benefit to *some* people. Everyon=\r\ne has a role to play and that is why Nature has created them!\n&gt;  \n&gt; But an =\r\nideal sadguru who can really give you a strong push in your spiritual pursu=\r\nits is one who has no ego, one who does not have a bloated sense of self-im=\r\nportance, one who has no pride, one who identifies with and is guided by th=\r\ne Infinite and one who is fulfilling his/her dharma without any expectation=\r\ns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. If the fact is that there is no=\r\n I but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for Brahman, why all this Maya?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me ask a similar q=\r\nuestion:\n&gt;  \n&gt; If whatever happens in a dream is not really happening and j=\r\nust being imagined in your mind, why all that imagination? Why not just be =\r\ndreamless?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *That* is not the correct or useful question! If the fact =\r\nis that you *are* in a dream, a more useful question is: How can I realize =\r\nthat I am in a dream and come out of the dream into a state of wakefulness?=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I briefly described how my relatitonship w=\r\nith my spiritual guru  started in the mail that Utpal mentioned below. Duri=\r\nng the time Manish was waiting for me to start using the rudraksha mala he =\r\nsent, he used to call me now and then and talk about spiritual matters. He =\r\nwould sometimes talk about very specific things that I was thinking of just=\r\n before he called. He would address my question without my asking. A couple=\r\n of times, I mentioned that to him and said he was answering exactly what I=\r\n was thinking of, as though he read my mind. He would humbly say, &quot;do you t=\r\nhink that I know your thoughts? I have no clue. I am just saying what I fee=\r\nl like saying. Shiva wanted to answer your question and used me as an instr=\r\nument to answer your question. It is god who does everything. We are mere i=\r\nnstruments.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Once he said, &quot;my message is *not* that I am special. My=\r\n message is that *you* are special. My message is that *everyone* is specia=\r\nl. I am not here to just experience divinity and go. I am here to show peop=\r\nle that it is possible even today and make *thousands* of people experience=\r\n divinity. I do not want people to become like me. I want to see thousands =\r\nof people becoming *better than* me.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He also said once, &quot;I am not he=\r\nre to show an alternative spiritual path to people. If one is a Krishna dev=\r\notee, let one remain a Krishna devotee. If one is an aghori, let one remain=\r\n an aghori. If one is in a religious movement, let one remain in that movem=\r\nent. If one is a Christian, let him remain a Christian. I just want people =\r\nto realize the essence of religion and spirituality, imbibe it in their thi=\r\nnking and become better in their own chosen path.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Already, so much c=\r\nhange happened in the 5.5 years since he called me first. I never thought I=\r\n could be in the state I am today. I never thought the changes in my thinki=\r\nng that happened in the last few years were possible. I never thought so ma=\r\nny seemingly normal people would be able to perform a homam regularly. When=\r\n Manish told me that today&#39;s times need a lot of people performing homam re=\r\ngularly and that a lot of people were out there who would start homam and m=\r\nake great progress with 5-6 years of homam, I was not so sure. Manish alway=\r\ns knew what to do, was quite confident and did not worry about how and whet=\r\nher it would get done. At the same time, he never lost the attitude of &quot;She=\r\n is doing and I am just an instrument&quot; and imbibed that attitude in me too!=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; As I said before, the sign of a good guru is that you see transforma=\r\ntion within yourself. The sign of a good guru is that you see things gettin=\r\ng done that once seemed impossible or very difficult. The sign of a good gu=\r\nru is that you achieve far more than before and yet have far less attachmen=\r\nt to (and pride in) what you do.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarashi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha is contemporary to us and a professional with family life.

Can a Guru help us? He took Jiddu Kris=\r\nhnamurthy&#39; s view on this. JK claims that a guru can not help any one and t=\r\nhe self realisation has to come from with in. My friend is asking, if a Gur=\r\nu is useless as JK claims, why did JK write so many books (no offence to JK=\r\n followers)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If a person has to realise on himself, how =\r\nit can be?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. If the fact is that there is no I but for Br=\r\nahman, why all this Maya? Why is Braham that is me has to go through the mi=\r\nsery and in the end realise that he is Brahman? Why not Brahman be Brahman =\r\nand not create any thing?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could not give convincing answ=\r\ners to any of the questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vijay\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
