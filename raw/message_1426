Are you really this body?\n\nOne normally identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that goes \nwith that body. This identification is very very strong.\n\nYou are actually Brahman, the all-pervading, all-knowing and all-being \nessence of the universe. The same essence manifests as various beings, \nincluding various deities and various people, including your own body. And \n*you* really are that essence and not the body. Still you identify only with \nthe body.\n\nIt is possible to destroy this self identification with the body and \nidentify with another object such as a deity. When you identify with a \ndeity, your consciousness is in communion with that of the deity. Your will, \nthoughts and actions are those of the deity.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; When somebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I have to \n&gt; do ?\n\nFirst I can tell you what exactly you have to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself \nthat you will now identify with Shiva, because Shiva is great and you want \nto be great. In other words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact, \nuntil ego completely goes, it is not even possible.\n\nBefore you can self-identify with any deity, first your false \nself-identification with body has to cease. You should absolutely not think \nof your body as &quot;I&quot;.\n\nYour will, thoughts and actions should be those of Shiva.\n\nWill Shiva think of a specific physical body as &quot;I&quot;? No. If a specific \nphysical body has good or bad things happening to it, will Shiva feel \npleasure or pain? No. If people are praising a specific person, will Shiva \nfeel proud? No. If people are attacking and criticizing a specific person, \nwill Shiva feel angry? No.\n\nThe first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. Reach a \nstate where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain to the body and \npraise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other people. Reach a \nstate where equanimity of mind can be maintained in all circumstances.\n\nWHEN you reach that state, meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking of \nShiva.\n\n*        *        *\n\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa could self-identify with not only deities, but \npretty much any object of the universe. Once he went into deep meditation \nwhile admiring the beauty of grass in the lawn with dew on it. As he was \nabsorbed in deep meditation, a bird came and walked on the grass. His \nsishyas observed that some bruises appeared on his body suddenly then!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;manish gour&quot; &lt;manishgo_in@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 05, 2009 8:14 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Self Identification\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; What does self identification with a deity means?\n&gt;\n&gt; When somebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I have to \n&gt; do ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Manish\n\n\n"}}
