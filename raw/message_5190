The blood\n&gt; pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized.\n \nI=\r\nn order to avoid mis-conceptions in some readers, I want to expand the pers=\r\npective here.\n \nIn some cases, intervention from a capable guru may indeed =\r\nremove physical/material obstacles in one&#39;s life and sadhana. However, it d=\r\nepends on the individual case. In some cases, some physical/material obstac=\r\nles may have to be presented to the sadhaka, in order to make one progress!=\r\n\n \nAt the end of the day, we have to remember that the goal of sadhana is n=\r\not physical and material well-being. It is to overcome ego and its various =\r\naspects, including attachment to physical and material well-being. However,=\r\n as we do sadhana using the physical body, which is sensitive to material c=\r\nonditions around it, some level of physical and material well-being is nece=\r\nssary for smooth sadhana and progress. However, at some stage or the other,=\r\n one needs to overcome those attachments. Depending on one&#39;s readiness and =\r\nthe conditioning one has, one may traverse a different path.\n \nAs an exampl=\r\ne, I will take the person whose first Kundalini awakening experience was de=\r\nscribed in:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476\n \nHe =\r\nwas being guided by a capable guru, who had actually told him ahead that hi=\r\ns time for Kundalini awakening had come. Yet, in the month or two after the=\r\n experience, the person&#39;s health was bad. He was getting fever frequently a=\r\nnd feeling weak and weird. Now and then, he would experience flow of electr=\r\nicity in the back, would lose awareness of the body and see sights and bein=\r\ngs or hear sounds, including mantras and beejas, all internally. It would f=\r\neel very nice. Suddenly, that experience would end and his normal body awar=\r\neness would return. His attitude and internal reaction to what others said =\r\nabout him changed drastically. He could see that he was making progress and=\r\n was generally happy. But his physical health was quite unstable and he was=\r\n uncomfortable when he was aware of the physical body.\n \nThough he was worr=\r\nied a little in the beginning about it, he later stopped bothering about ph=\r\nysical health. He told himself that this was just one layer of reality and =\r\nnot the most important one and not worth worrying much. His focus turned in=\r\nwards.\n \nAfter a few months of instability, his health became fine again. H=\r\nis nervous system perhaps reached a new equilibrium. His lifestyle changed.=\r\n He would eat much less food than before and yet feel energetic enough.\n \nI=\r\nf one experiences physical problems after taking up a sadhana, one has thre=\r\ne options: (1) stop the sadhana, (2) look for ways to improve the problem, =\r\n(3) try to overcome physical concerns and rise above the body. Differebt pe=\r\nrsons may approach differently, based on their readiness.\n \nBest regards,\nN=\r\narasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                =\r\n  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n =\r\n\n---- Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namast=\r\ne Narasimha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure to have=\r\n your &gt;&gt;&gt;learned &gt;&gt;&gt;company here.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you. It is a nice group as =\r\nI already noted in my first post.  Most importantly it is always a joy to i=\r\nnteract with you.\n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Traditional &gt;&gt;&gt;conventions are not wit=\r\nhout basis, but I suggest &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we need to understand their &gt;&gt;&gt;motivation.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Both of us share a similar approach here. As I already wrote in an earli=\r\ner post, &quot;there will be varied beliefs and opinions ranging from the very r=\r\nigid traditional extreme to the very liberal and casual new-age extreme bas=\r\ned on one&#39;s personal affiliations, family and cultural influences&quot;.   Neith=\r\ner of us is at the liberal/casual extreme nor the very rigid traditional ex=\r\ntreme. Both of us seem to be somewhere in the middle though at different po=\r\nints.   \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;If one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awak=\r\nens, things &gt;&gt;&gt;are fine. But, that may not &gt;&gt;happen. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini can take=\r\n many different paths and go to different places. Depending on the &gt;&gt;&gt;impur=\r\nities in various nadis, various experiences are possible. If a sadhaka is u=\r\nnprepared to handle &gt;&gt;&gt;the experience, it can create &gt;&gt;&gt;problems. One can e=\r\nxperience something nice and become proud and &gt;&gt;&gt;egoistic and get stuck the=\r\nre. One can experience a very fierce form of divine and get scared to death=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or go mad. Many &gt;&gt;&gt;possibilities are there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent poin=\r\nt. Here I will share something from my own experience to illustrate this. I=\r\nnitially I was hesitant to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it mi=\r\nght help put things in a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sa=\r\ndhana single-mindedly as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studi=\r\nes. Those days I used to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and san=\r\nyasis. Some of my co-sadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordaine=\r\nd monks later. Swadhyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the=\r\n mainstay of my sadhana at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of =\r\nthis period I started doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any in=\r\nitiation. Things were fine and I made some progress probably owing to a com=\r\nbination of many factors. After spending three years in spiritual studies a=\r\nnd sadhana, I decided to return home and pursue medical studies in accordan=\r\nce with my mother&#39;s wish. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursui=\r\nng my medical studies too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Around early 95, I started doing Devi Mahat=\r\nmya parayana with *more* vigour. Within a month I started having piercing h=\r\neadaches, my body would be quite hot to touch and my blood pressure would s=\r\nhoot up to around 150/110 on and off. After conducting the standard investi=\r\ngations, Dr. Rao from the Dept of Medicine, who had already taken a liking =\r\nto me, suspected that it *might* have something to do with my sadhanas too.=\r\n Things continued to be the same for some more months, till I got introduce=\r\nd to Swami Sachchidananda in what seemed to be a chance meeting. During the=\r\n course of conversation Swamiji asked me to meet him alone the next day aft=\r\ner coming to know about my practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana. After in=\r\nteracting everyday for a week Swamiji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi path.  After a week or so after the initiation all the symptoms subsid=\r\ned. The blood pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized. It has been ar=\r\nound 15 years since then and none of the symptoms have recurred. What&#39;s mor=\r\ne, I had some very powerful internal experiences in quick succession during=\r\n the following week itself after initiation. This is my experience.\n&gt;      =\r\n                            \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(6) If one is not looking for any spec=\r\nific results and doing a &gt;&gt;&gt;mantra just for spiritual progress with a &gt;&gt;&gt;se=\r\nnse of surrender, one is safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Right from the start whatever sa=\r\ndhanas I did, were all done largely as a spiritual pursuit only with no spe=\r\ncific results in mind at least consciously. However the general desire to m=\r\nake progress would have naturally been there.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (5) Especially if=\r\n one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga &gt;&gt;&gt;practices that are meant to=\r\n forcefully &gt;&gt;&gt;awaken and raise Kundalini &gt;&gt;&gt;and if one does not consciousl=\r\ny think in terms of &gt;&gt;&gt;raising Kundalini, one is &gt;&gt;&gt;safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thoug=\r\nh I was not consciously thinking of raising Kundalni or anything like that =\r\nand was just focusing on sadhana, you are right about the raja yoga/hatha y=\r\noga practices. Yogabhyasa was a regular part of my sadhana during 89-92. In=\r\n fact I became a qualified Yogacharya during this time. However Devi Mahatm=\r\nya parayana was part of my sadhana along with yogabhyasa since early 91-92 =\r\nduring which time things were fine. It was only in 94 that I resumed Devi M=\r\nahatmya parayana more seriously. Of course I was doing my yogabhyasa too at=\r\n this time. I have already written about the rest.  \n&gt; \n&gt; My stance regardi=\r\nng the role of initiation stems from my own experience as well as the instr=\r\nuctions coming down through the guru parampara. However I can appreciate yo=\r\nur stance as well. Let me add something more here. No two individuals have =\r\nthe same experience in such matters. Some may experience nothing significan=\r\nt after initiation and may still be progressing. Some may need more guidanc=\r\ne due to the nature of the specific practices that they have got into. Eith=\r\nerways She will take care.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given this statement, the dif=\r\nference of opinion between us are very subtle.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is better for=\r\n all of us to focus more on the underlying unity of our thought and not on =\r\nthe difference. Moreover overstretching such discussions can deter some sad=\r\nhakas which is not something that anyone of us would wish for.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a sense=\r\n of guilt, it blocks the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practice from working &gt;&gt;&gt;effectively. Please d=\r\no whatever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have the se=\r\nnse of guilt, work on overcoming it. If &gt;&gt;&gt;you cannot overcome it, it may b=\r\ne a good &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea to find a &gt;&gt;&gt;sadhana with which you feel comfortable and =\r\nhave no sense of guilt.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that there are many good sadhaka=\r\ns doing Sri Sri Chandipath without initiation. There is no need for anyone =\r\nto feel guilty. It is only good samskaras and vasanas that attract a sadhak=\r\na to Sri Sri Chandi. One does not need to feel guilty for worshipping or lo=\r\nving the Goddess.  If you take my own example, initially I did the sadhana =\r\nwithout initiation. It is only Her Grace that I was initiated. I didn&#39;t eve=\r\nn ask for it. If it is meant to be it will be. Things will happen on their =\r\nown accord in the natural flow. The main thing is that the sadhaka should l=\r\neave the rest to the compassionate Goddess and trust that She will take car=\r\ne of everything.                   \n&gt; \n&gt; On this note I suggest that we sho=\r\nuld wrap up the topic of initiation. From my side I wish to say nothing mor=\r\ne. \n&gt; \n&gt; I might be off the list till another fortnight or so as I am trave=\r\nlling.\n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; All Glories to the Goddess!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Satya Prak=\r\nash   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste Satya Prakash garu,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure =\r\nto have your learned company here.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Traditional conventions are no=\r\nt without basis, but I suggest we need to understand their motivation.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When one chants long prayers such as Ch=\r\nandipath, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra, Aditya Hridayam etc, it requires a l=\r\not of conscious mental activity. One mostly cannot go into samadhi while ch=\r\nanting them (though there can be exceptions). On the other hand, when one c=\r\nhants Gayatri mantra or ashtakshari mantra or dwadasakshari mantra or panch=\r\nakshari mantra or navarna mantra or various beeja mantras or other small ma=\r\nntras, it requires a minimal amount of conscious mental activity. With repe=\r\ntitive and minimal mental activity, there is a possibility of momentary ces=\r\nsation of mental activity and entering samadhi OR awakening of Kundalini an=\r\nd progress towards samadhi.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one reaches samadhi directly when =\r\nKundalini awakens, things are fine. But, that may not happen. Kundalini can=\r\n take many different paths and go to different places. Depending on the imp=\r\nurities in various nadis, various experiences are possible. If a sadhaka is=\r\n unprepared to handle the experience, it can create problems. One can exper=\r\nience something nice and become proud and egoistic and get stuck there. One=\r\n can experience a very fierce form of divine and get scared to death or go =\r\nmad. Many possibilities are there.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thus, practices that can truly=\r\n awaken one were kept limited to the initiated. Guru would assess the progr=\r\ness and readiness of a sadhaka and initiate one when one is ready.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, there are a few things that are di=\r\nfferent in today&#39;s times:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) There are very few people who are r=\r\neady to experience something. Most people will just do sadhana, burn some b=\r\nasic blocking karmas and not really experience much. At most, some people w=\r\nill experience an awakening and just a little movement of Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; (2=\r\n) There are very few gurus who are indeed capable of assessing and guiding =\r\na sadhaka well. Most initiations are a mere formality.\n&gt; &gt; (3) With the ins=\r\nistence on initiation etc, we may be blocking, in the coming years, the ver=\r\ny few sadhakas who MAY actually achieve some progress with a mantra, from e=\r\nven trying it.\n&gt; &gt; (4) If a sadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of &quot;I d=\r\no not know the right way. I am just doing what I am capable of. Please take=\r\n care of me Mother&quot;, none of the risks I mentioned above will really apply.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; (5) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga practice=\r\ns that are meant to forcefully awaken and raise Kundalini and if one does n=\r\not consciously think in terms of raising Kundalini, one is safe.\n&gt; &gt; (6) If=\r\n one is not looking for any specific results and doing a mantra just for sp=\r\niritual progress with a sense of surrender, one is safe.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Apart from assessing the readiness, there are some mo=\r\nre functions performed by an initiating guru:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) A guru can jump=\r\nstart one&#39;s sadhana with a mantra and results can come faster.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nwever, this expects a guru of some caliber and achievement with the mantra.=\r\n After all, if one wants a one-on-one audience with Sachin Tendulkar or Rog=\r\ner Federer or Barack Obama, being introduced to them by someone they know a=\r\nnd someone that had a one-on-one audience with them earlier can be helpful =\r\n(instead of introducing by oneself). If someone who merely read more about =\r\nthem but is not any closer to them tries to introduce you to them, will it =\r\neven get their attention?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Now-a-days, most people do not have acc=\r\ness to gurus who have experienced the divine with a mantra. Such people are=\r\n very rare. One&#39;s best bet is to do sadhana by oneself, using all the tools=\r\n given by rishis and various spiritual masters. When one is ready (and if i=\r\nt is needed), a guru may come and take one&#39;s sadhana to the next level.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; (2) A guru can mould the correct attitude in sadhaka before a sadhan=\r\na is taken up.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, there are sadhakas initiated in powerful =\r\nmantras and not having the right attitude. For example, I know people initi=\r\nated into Bagalamukhi mantra and trying to use it to win litigation. If one=\r\n does not know that a &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (supreme knowledge) is for overcoming con=\r\nditioning and realizing self and not for winning court cases, one&#39;s initiat=\r\nion is no good.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I know some people not formall=\r\ny initiated into Chandipath, but doing Chandi homam daily with saptashati a=\r\nnd also navarna mantra. I know that they do not have any specific material =\r\ngoals and are overcoming the few desires that were originally there at the =\r\nback of the mind. The are making quick progress spiritually and their think=\r\ning is getting transformed nicely. Despite having no formal initiation, are=\r\nn&#39;t they worshipping Chandi as a Mahavidya?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that on=\r\ne can mould one&#39;s own attitude through a formal initiation or through readi=\r\nng scriptures, satsanga and constant contemplation. One thing may work bett=\r\ner in one case and another thing in another case.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (3) A guru can =\r\nteach the correct procedure of a sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, role of proced=\r\nural correctness in success is a higher in sadhanas for specific results th=\r\nan sadhana for spiritual progress. I maintain that the art of getting speci=\r\nfic results from sadhanas is being hidden more and more as Kali progresses,=\r\n for a reason. I suggest that it is useless to even think in those terms an=\r\nd pursue it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Mantras like navarna mantra can just be meditated on=\r\n, without any specific procedure. When one is ready and pure enough, they c=\r\nan give one an experience of the divine. Mantras like Siddha Kunjika stotra=\r\n, that codify several specific sadhanas to get specific results, are anyway=\r\n inaccessible to most people of this age! They are only available in codifi=\r\ned form and gurus who can decode them will keep disappearing more and more.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are already doing =\r\nSri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no need to worry or =\r\nbe confused. ... Please keep doing whatever you are doing.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Given =\r\nthis statement, the difference of opinion between us are very subtle.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a sen=\r\nse of guilt, it blocks the practice from working effectively. Please do wha=\r\ntever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If you have the sense of gu=\r\nilt, work on overcoming it. If you cannot overcome it, it may be a good ide=\r\na to find a sadhana with which you feel comfortable and have no sense of gu=\r\nilt.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow=\r\n. Leave the rest to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the compassionate Goddess.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s the b=\r\nottomline. Even if one were initiated, it would be quite difficult to not l=\r\neave things to the Goddess and make things happen as one wanted. Start sadh=\r\nana with some level of surrender. Then, sadhana will help increase the leve=\r\nl of surrender. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj garu,\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; The opinion referred to in your question 2 is not without basis. But a=\r\ngain, we need to understand the motivation to put it in the right perspecti=\r\nve.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one experiences divine through sadhana with Gayatri mantra=\r\n (or any mantra), then it is easy for one to experience divine with another=\r\n mantra. One can just pick up a mantra, do it and experience relatively qui=\r\nckly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, if one was merely initiated in Gayatri mantra (or =\r\nany mantra) and did not really make much spiritual progress with it, that d=\r\noes not place one in any kind of advantage when it comes to sadhana with an=\r\nother mantra. That is my opinion.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;             =\r\n      http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Dr. Satya Prakash, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do see your points and do understand =\r\nthat Sankara peethams discourage the practise of mahavidyas without the Ini=\r\ntiation. But here are a couple of questions. Since you seem to be deeply kn=\r\nowledgeable, please clarify these questions. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. In the devi =\r\nmahaatmyam, mother is saying in sloka 11 of chapter 12, that she would be h=\r\nappy if one does this with or without knowledge. Could you please comment o=\r\nn that. My understanding/interpretation could be wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. I =\r\nheard from one of the pundits that since Gayatri Mantra is considered the g=\r\nreatest of all mantras, one who has initiation in Gayatri Mantra (which is =\r\ngiven as part of upanayanam) need not have any other initiation. You could =\r\ngive your valuable opinion on the same. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Nagraj  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially I agree with Narasimha =\r\ngaru in most matters in this discussion. The only major point where I disag=\r\nree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The res=\r\nt of the confusion on translation of mantras needs some clarification as th=\r\nere seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.=\r\n\tThere are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas=\r\n etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, st=\r\notras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahaman=\r\ntras and mantras.  The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as m=\r\nantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.\tUndoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted=\r\n in the original. Reading a translation is not even comparable to chanting =\r\nthe original chant. So far it is fine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.\tWhilst mantra, stotr=\r\na and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction bet=\r\nween them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.\tAs per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t nee=\r\nd to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same wi=\r\nth most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of=\r\n Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from=\r\n the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that need initiat=\r\nion, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever yo=\r\nu call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral par=\r\nts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as i=\r\nn the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5.\tVishnusahasr=\r\nanama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they f=\r\nall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are tr=\r\naditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a l=\r\narger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them withou=\r\nt initiation is not recommended especially when the reader combines the nav=\r\narna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    =\r\n        \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6.\tI know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging =\r\nto both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both=\r\n the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective N=\r\nAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (=\r\nANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs=\r\n to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7.\tRecapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text =\r\nthat has an independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simu=\r\nltaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spi=\r\nrit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part=\r\n of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initi=\r\nated to chant it. However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or=\r\n Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in th=\r\ne vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original =\r\nalong with the navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya=\r\n. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and go through the special=\r\nised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8.\tArguably if an unin=\r\nitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of=\r\n the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem=\r\n in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatm=\r\nyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers inadvertentl=\r\ny end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunj=\r\nika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 9.\tI you caref=\r\nully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere =\r\ndo I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I attempted =\r\nto write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power =\r\nof the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know t=\r\nhe essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting i=\r\nt. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10.\tFor those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path withou=\r\nt initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a c=\r\nertain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We =\r\nall have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiatio=\r\nn). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sa=\r\nkama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to jus=\r\nt do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude i=\r\ntself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on the=\r\nir own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Godd=\r\ness.              \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope the above pointers help in clearing an=\r\ny confusion.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash                \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h rama=\r\nlingam &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wa=\r\nnt to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Swamigal was staying=\r\n in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned persons=\r\n male and female alike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu S=\r\nahasraNamam in kannada language\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so that they can chant knowing the =\r\nmeaning fully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made=\r\n early in the morning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc we=\r\nre over as usual Postman came to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camp to deliver the posts came to =\r\nKanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; in front of the learned members and was looking at one line written =\r\nas PIN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Code and followed by six numbers.

Similarly not knowing the meaning of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vishnu Sah=\r\naranamam will not take away the benefits of chanting the stothsram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwas he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring some clue to our\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; discussion forum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Oct 26, =\r\n2010 at 9:10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n Girish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not at all against knowing the meaning, s=\r\no that one can immerse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oneself in what one is chanting. That is d=\r\nefinitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If that is not possible,=\r\n what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; composed by an elevat=\r\ned being even without understanding the meaning is very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful. S=\r\nuppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it=\r\n is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correct attitude an=\r\nd surrender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific m=\r\neaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the mean=\r\ning and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important layers =\r\nare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of meaning are=\r\n never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only experienced internally=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra=\r\n with a calm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Ma=\r\nny people keep a target\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechan=\r\nically with a sense of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit=\r\n of love and surrender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key=\r\n to success with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is f=\r\nilled with thousands of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; one of those thousand activities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subside and mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that=\r\n is when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are =\r\n4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\naccompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras=\r\n composed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially bei=\r\nngs with very stable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the p=\r\nhysical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can eventually cause the correspo=\r\nnding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when other mental activit=\r\ny subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calming the mind=\r\n down, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in y=\r\nour mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of BhagavadGita and Sa=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power of their own, as th=\r\ney were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized souls.

They are tools to silence the mind and channel it=\r\ns energy. They are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yog=\r\nis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, right\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra t=\r\nhat was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellec=\r\ntually understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be more effective for spiritual progress, t=\r\nhan the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person that one can intellectually unde=\r\nrstand and appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying about whether o=\r\nne understands or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming from gr=\r\neat rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman m=\r\nay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to =\r\nsee the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how g=\r\net into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a straight bat,=\r\n when to play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. But that=\r\n does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; batsman. If one practices, =\r\nTHAT can make one a good player. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basic understand=\r\ning of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more im=\r\nportant than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some con=\r\nceptual understanding is important in spirituality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, but abov=\r\ne that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of a=\r\nll scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very simpl=\r\ne. It is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nings and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives correspond=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the=\r\n notions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I disl=\r\nike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and o=\r\nne knows it, one may be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and again. There is no magi=\r\nc formula to internalize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and overcome th=\r\ne instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So=\r\n, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watchi=\r\nng over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable=\r\n thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of =\r\nsadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is fin=\r\ne to meet spiritual people (physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) a=\r\nnd discuss good things. But that will only create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical u=\r\nnderstanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of wha=\r\nt is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person running around=\r\n a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but h=\r\naving an excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person wh=\r\no knows that he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at=\r\n the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is important in ta=\r\nntric path but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths=\r\n or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccur=\r\nate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik =\r\nvs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody=\r\n who wants specific material results needs to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; careful regardin=\r\ng how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; partic=\r\nular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for self-realization=\r\n. That is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant M=\r\nanyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for lon=\r\ngevity, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a g=\r\nross substance in an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion tha=\r\nt &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards som=\r\ne objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbru=\r\nle is this. If you are looking for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu need clear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiat=\r\nion or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-m=\r\ninded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to Calcu=\r\ntta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directions and some supervision. =\r\nIf you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can keep walking toward=\r\ns north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too, but you c=\r\nan do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n\n\n"}}
