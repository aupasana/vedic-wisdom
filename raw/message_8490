I absolutely lov=\r\ne it. \n\nDidn&#39;t know about Saawan being dear to Lord Shiva, but will certain=\r\nly be spending this holy month learning more about him via this program, an=\r\nd doing some extra chanting of His Names. Thanks for writing about it here,=\r\n and &#39;accidentally&#39; introducing me to it too. :) \n\nHara Hara Mahadev! Prost=\r\nrations to Shiva, Vishnu and Devi who are different wonderful forms of the =\r\nsame Divinity.  \n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, dolly jh=\r\na &lt;jha.dolly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; dear aparna,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; thanks for being my puras=\r\nhcharan buddy.\n&gt; sounds very cool...:) :) :)\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; yes, we sure will prod=\r\n each other to do our bests\n&gt; and keep boosting each other&#39;s morale :)\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; m waiting for puja coz beginning this puja m\n&gt; planning to do somethi=\r\nng that i plan to follow\n&gt; for the rest of my life hence this intezaar of p=\r\nuja :)\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; for now i&#39;ll cleanse my body and strengthen it\n&gt; so m able t=\r\no contain the energy that all those chants\n&gt; will invoke in me.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; so =\r\nall those sessions of=A0laghu shankh prakshalan\n&gt; will soon begin...in fact=\r\n in a day or two.\n&gt; and then i&#39;ll have to try to sit in one aasan for a lon=\r\nger\n&gt; period of time.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; also, m planning to do shiv panchakshar mantr=\r\na\n&gt; (namah shivaay ya vashi mana)\n&gt; purashcharan for now... as it is the ho=\r\nly month of saawan.\n&gt; will start it this monday..and try to complete it wit=\r\nhin saawan.\n&gt; i love my innocent macho man...Shivaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!! :)\n&gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; i hope i have something worthwhile to share with you\n&gt; after m thru with=\r\n the &quot;Big P&quot;.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; take care :)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
