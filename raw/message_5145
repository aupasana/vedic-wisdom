The only major point where I disagree is whether one c=\r\nan do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion o=\r\nn translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some=\r\n unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:\n\n1.\tThere are various sacred chants=\r\n embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacr=\r\ned chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. S=\r\nome stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras.  The Samhita p=\r\nortion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.\n \n2.\tUndoubtedly mantras=\r\n and stotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is n=\r\not even comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.\n\n3.\tW=\r\nhilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition make=\r\ns a distinction between them.\n     \n4.\tAs per the traditional view one does=\r\nn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the =\r\nsame with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, man=\r\ntras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantr=\r\nas from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that need =\r\ninitiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. What=\r\never you call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integ=\r\nral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiatio=\r\nn, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n \n5.\tVishnusahasranama=\r\n, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall u=\r\nnder stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditi=\r\nonally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger=\r\n status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without ini=\r\ntiation is not recommended especially when the reader combines the navarna =\r\nor shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.\n           \n6.=\r\n\tI know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as=\r\n well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of =\r\nSri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHO=\r\nDASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadh=\r\nana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to be initiated =\r\nto chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n \n7.\tRecapping my e=\r\narlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independent statu=\r\ns by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yog=\r\nasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As =\r\na Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. T=\r\nhus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if =\r\none wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the D=\r\nevi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recomme=\r\nnded in my write-up, as chanting the original along with the navakshari  am=\r\nounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommen=\r\nded to be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properly under =\r\nguidance.\n \n8.\tArguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam i=\r\nn the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mah=\r\navidya, it has an inherent problem in our times.  The problem with attempti=\r\nng to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation)=\r\n is that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra=\r\n or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksh=\r\naras.\n \n9.\tI you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget=\r\n translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Nei=\r\nther have I attempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras =\r\ndo not have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is=\r\n recommended to know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sa=\r\ndhana while chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;=\r\n, not a translation! \n\n10.\tFor those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi p=\r\nath without initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has=\r\n to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path i=\r\ntself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no=\r\n initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious no=\r\nt to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is bet=\r\nter to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That =\r\nattitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will hap=\r\npen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassi=\r\nonate Goddess.              \n\nHope the above pointers help in clearing any =\r\nconfusion.  \n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash                \n\n\n\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namas=\r\nte everybody\n&gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Mah=\r\na Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; When Swamigal was =\r\nstaying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the\n&gt; learned person=\r\ns male and female alike\n&gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu Sahasr=\r\naNamam in kannada language\n&gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning ful=\r\nly.\n&gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in the mor=\r\nning.\n&gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were over as usual Postma=\r\nn came to\n&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamiga=\r\nl was\n&gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; in front of the learned members an=\r\nd was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; Code and followed by six numbers=\r\n. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; explain the meaning of PIN Code an=\r\nd no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; understood the significance of tha=\r\nt number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbr=\r\neviations book from his library and read\n&gt; the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMB=\r\nER and told the group that even the meaning\n&gt; of PINCode was not known to t=\r\nhe group and still it serves the purpose and\n&gt; people are using it in day t=\r\no day work. Similarly not knowing the meaning of\n&gt; Vishnu Saharanamam will =\r\nnot take away the benefits of chanting the stothsram\n&gt; was he told the grou=\r\np. Hope the above incidence bring some clue to our\n&gt; discussion forum\n&gt; Ram=\r\nanaPatham\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 9:10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Girish,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not at all agains=\r\nt knowing the meaning, so that one can immerse\n&gt; &gt; oneself in what one is c=\r\nhanting. That is definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that is not pos=\r\nsible, what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; &gt; composed by an elevat=\r\ned being even without understanding the meaning is very\n&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose=\r\n someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; means, thin=\r\nks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of\n&gt; &gt; everything and =\r\nchants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can\n&gt; &gt; still benefit=\r\n immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is more\n&gt; &gt; likely beca=\r\nuse one does not have the correct attitude and surrender and\n&gt; &gt; probably n=\r\not because one does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; Atharvaseers=\r\nham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; experience n=\r\nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many =\r\nlayers and\n&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some importan=\r\nt layers are\n&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of meaning =\r\nare never\n&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a targ=\r\net\n&gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty=\r\n. If it\n&gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the dei=\r\nty, it can do\n&gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra is calmness o=\r\nf the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thoughts and chanting=\r\n of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; one of those thousand activities, nothing will h=\r\nappen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; subside and mind is essentially reverberating w=\r\nith a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are =\r\n4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is\n&gt; &gt; accomp=\r\nanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; inst=\r\nincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras composed\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially beings with very stab=\r\nle\n&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the physical vibration of the=\r\n mantra\n&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the corresponding imagery in the mind by r=\r\nesonance,\n&gt; &gt; when other mental activity subsides. Thus, after repeating th=\r\ne mantra and\n&gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery =\r\nand thought system\n&gt; &gt; in your mind. That can permanently alter the way you=\r\nr mind workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and=\r\n calm mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of BhagavadGi=\r\nta and Sant\n&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power of their own, as=\r\n they were\n&gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, for examplle, Satyadevaashtak=\r\nam composed by\n&gt; &gt; me, though in metrical Sanskrit, will not have a similar=\r\n power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedi=\r\ncastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;geniusgirish@...&lt;geniusgirish%40yaho=\r\no.co.in&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it not be of immense help =\r\nto the ordinary person whose knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; Sanskrit is limited not only =\r\nto &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more\n&gt; &gt; interest, enjoyment, an=\r\nd truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ reading?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is=\r\n the reason for the great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar to\n&gt; &gt; compose the B=\r\nhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I agree with you that the sacred sto=\r\ntras should be recited in\n&gt; &gt; sanskrit...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Humbly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Shahap=\r\nurkar\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40ch=\r\narter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@... &lt;pvr%40=\r\ncharter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Translations, Initiation, Vedic=\r\n vs Tantrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents on a few points.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother =\r\ntongue Telugu\n&gt; &gt; in poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati=\r\n too complicated to\n&gt; &gt; read or feel uncomfortable because they do not know=\r\n the meaning, can read\n&gt; &gt; the Telugu version instead. When I floated the i=\r\ndea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He=\r\n said that it could be considered\n&gt; &gt; later, but firmly told me to drop the=\r\n idea for then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that the goal of sadhan=\r\na, such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; mantras and prayers, is NOT just=\r\n an intellectual understanding of what they\n&gt; &gt; mean. They are tools to sil=\r\nence the mind and channel its energy. They are\n&gt; &gt; storehouses of some shak=\r\nti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the ri=\r\nght mood, right\n&gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, =\r\na mantra that was\n&gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot inte=\r\nllectually understand\n&gt; &gt; can be more effective for spiritual progress, tha=\r\nn the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; person that one can intellectually understand a=\r\nnd appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; not worrying about whether one understands=\r\n or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sad=\r\nhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to g=\r\nive an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may\n&gt; &gt; read a lot of=\r\n scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball\n&gt; &gt; from the =\r\nhand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; ball=\r\n, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nto play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; ba=\r\ntsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Simila=\r\nrly, some conceptual understanding is important in spirituality\n&gt; &gt; also, b=\r\nut above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The essen=\r\nce of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; &gt; very simp=\r\nle. It is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; things =\r\nand realize that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; &gt; thr=\r\nough each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding\n&gt; &gt; rea=\r\nctions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though t=\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be delud=\r\ned again\n&gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this under=\r\nstanding fully\n&gt; &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is min=\r\ne&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one=\r\n does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; understand, that is ok. As long as the basic e=\r\nssence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly co=\r\nntemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root=\r\n out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating th=\r\ne need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is=\r\n fine to meet spiritual people (physically\n&gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) and=\r\n discuss good things. But that will only create\n&gt; &gt; a theoretical understan=\r\nding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, t=\r\nhoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One d=\r\noing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is\n&gt; &gt; what =\r\nand what we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; ins=\r\ntead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\noretical understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the stateme=\r\nnt that initiation is important in tantric path but\n&gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, =\r\nI want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik=\r\n paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. T=\r\nhere are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The iss=\r\nue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt; what=\r\n one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be\n&gt; &gt; car=\r\neful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n particular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; constraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some may =\r\nsub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting\n&gt; &gt; specif=\r\nic material results and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is\n&gt; &gt; inc=\r\norrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; vi=\r\nctory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; Simila=\r\nrly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific m=\r\naterial result,\n&gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and supervision, which not many=\r\n are capable of\n&gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress a=\r\nnd an increase of\n&gt; &gt; your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana witho=\r\nut initiation or\n&gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other li=\r\nke-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to C=\r\nalcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; directions and some supervision. If=\r\n you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; can keep walking towards north.=\r\n Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; too, but you can do without =\r\nit!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do=\r\n It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswati=\r\nfilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@... &lt;vedic_pathak=\r\n%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in Engli=\r\nsh or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language is because understanding the meaning=\r\n and &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads t=\r\nhe &gt;text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its understandable.

Si=\r\nnce\n&gt; &gt; the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet foru=\r\nms due to\n&gt; &gt; various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted=\r\n on an internet\n&gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of=\r\n the original post\n&gt; &gt; with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum a=\r\nnd quickly browsed\n&gt; &gt; through some posts. I am happy to note that the gene=\r\nral atmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; far better and more sincere than a lot of other =\r\nforums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; browsed through this particular thread, I though=\r\nt that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessity=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the M=\r\nANY\n&gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolu=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. Howev=\r\ner if\n&gt; &gt; the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra=\r\n sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage=\r\n goes; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths=\r\n. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-In=\r\ndian context there are\n&gt; &gt; many paths for sadhana. But in the current conte=\r\nxt of this question I will\n&gt; &gt; restrict myself to only the five that are re=\r\nlevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marg=\r\na (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga=\r\n (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/=\r\nor Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is =\r\nnothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; &gt; abstract Truths of the Co=\r\nsmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular\n&gt; &gt; methods and techniq=\r\nues in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at\n&gt; &gt; an experienti=\r\nal level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/\n&gt; &gt; techniques em=\r\nployed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predomin=\r\nantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; &gt; speaking even the external gu=\r\nru is not necessary, though one can greatly\n&gt; &gt; benefit from the wisdom and=\r\n experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path\n&gt; &gt; of Advaita emphasises=\r\n the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara\n&gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Adv=\r\naita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; system it has retain=\r\ned the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular\n&gt; &gt; self-study of texts) too=\r\n as an important practice. All of these practices\n&gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in=\r\n a big way with a marginal role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schoo=\r\nls of\n&gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself=\r\n towards\n&gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yoga=\r\nmarga\n&gt; &gt; emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasise=\r\ns unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to =\r\nthe Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; &gt; emphasis in Karma marga is on Action a=\r\ns advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; Engaging in actions without attachmen=\r\nt to the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; &gt; Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra=\r\n sadhana where\n&gt; &gt; alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby=\r\n the necessity of a\n&gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicali=\r\nzation of certain occult\n&gt; &gt; truths via the energetics of Sabda through the=\r\n employment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab =\r\nexperiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; certain regulations and safe practices. It shoul=\r\nd be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni=\r\n at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; predominantly invokes Soma (the refere=\r\nnce here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invok=\r\ne Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; the fire of the intellect, another the=\r\n fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; &gt; austerity, and yet another the phy=\r\nsical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tan=\r\ntra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through\n&gt; &gt; the la=\r\nb-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful\n&gt; &gt; tec=\r\nhniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; adhik=\r\nara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualification.\n&gt; &gt; Woul=\r\nd you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision?\n&gt; &gt; Do=\r\nes the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other lab\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; experiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apar=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. Howe=\r\nver the\n&gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakeni=\r\nng the Sakti\n&gt; &gt; within the individual consciousness (also referred to as K=\r\nundalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I=\r\n will refrain from\n&gt; &gt; further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going i=\r\nnto other needless\n&gt; &gt; details here, I will just elaborate on initiation an=\r\nd Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking =\r\nabout Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise\n&gt; &gt; it within the larger Tan=\r\ntric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river\n&gt; &gt; within the Tantric c=\r\nontext. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta\n&gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehen=\r\nsively. However there are actually three major schools\n&gt; &gt; that are full-fl=\r\nedged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; &gt; Srikula an=\r\nd Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; Vidya=\r\n sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who ar=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 fo=\r\nrms of\n&gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as wel=\r\nl as the\n&gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is n=\r\not\n&gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least =\r\nat the\n&gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, =\r\nmantra,\n&gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of s=\r\nynchronistic\n&gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation i=\r\ns the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritua=\r\nl lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an=\r\n INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; himself at the root from where the trunk arise=\r\ns. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively down=\r\nward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can=\r\n visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; &gt; metaphor that one can use is that of elec=\r\ntricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt; &gt; advocate that initiation not only co=\r\nmpletes the circuit necessary for the\n&gt; &gt; conduit of electricity but also p=\r\nrevents short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; &gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at eac=\r\nh point in this inverted tree of live wires, where\n&gt; &gt; there is a long seri=\r\nes of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up\n&gt; &gt; till Siva hims=\r\nelf. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now ba=\r\nck to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated=\r\n Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the\n&gt; &gt; individual consciousnes=\r\ns through an integrated approach that combines the\n&gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, =\r\nDhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and\n&gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved =\r\ninto highly comprehensive and integrated approaches\n&gt; &gt; that can simultaneo=\r\nusly hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly\n&gt; &gt; starts with the=\r\n Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic=\r\n text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text\n&gt; &gt; on Yogasast=\r\nra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is\n&gt; &gt; relevant only=\r\n to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the text\n&gt; &gt; as a ma=\r\nntramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt; eso=\r\nteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nrite-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through i=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glor=\r\ny in the text is the\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in fu=\r\nll-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; fashion that She is one without a second, saying=\r\n &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5)=\r\n. Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on=\r\n the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reas=\r\non I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; &gt; other regional =\r\nlanguage is because understanding the meaning and constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection a=\r\nre possible only when one repeatedly reads the text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that =\r\nthey can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to\n&gt; &gt; explore the t=\r\next as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obvious\n&gt; &gt; status as =\r\nSacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as\n&gt; &gt; Sruti j=\r\nust as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard\n&gt; &gt; all =\r\nthe applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; possib=\r\nle with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; Anyone=\r\n who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway\n&gt; &gt; ide=\r\nntify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a =\r\none\n&gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an =\r\nintegral part of Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic ap=\r\nproach, there are those\n&gt; &gt; who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the s=\r\nadhana as per the mantra\n&gt; &gt; marga. It is this particular approach that nee=\r\nds initiation as per its own\n&gt; &gt; principles. Initiation is not mandatory if=\r\n one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; &gt; Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path =\r\nof Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt; &gt; Pauranic approach of reading the t=\r\next devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one =\r\nis not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. =\r\nOne may benefit from any or all of these\n&gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. =\r\nHowever one has to bear in mind that the\n&gt; &gt; living and breathing tradition=\r\ns of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; &gt; practiced originally in variou=\r\ns parts of the subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; &gt; themselves to Tantra marga=\r\n and hence the importance of initiation for those\n&gt; &gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, =\r\none can make spiritual progress through any of the\n&gt; &gt; merthods/practices u=\r\nsing Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; &gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhy=\r\nasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc\n&gt; &gt; are all effective.=\r\n However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude\n&gt; &gt; etc., some o=\r\nf these methods are more suited relatively to different\n&gt; &gt; practitioners. =\r\nOne may progress through a combination of any of these\n&gt; &gt; methods in spiri=\r\ntual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of\n&gt; &gt; KALIKULA i=\r\nnvolves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which\n&gt; &gt; the ans=\r\nwer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path,\n&gt; &gt; SWAD=\r\nHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us.\n&gt; &gt; Swadh=\r\nyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the\n&gt; &gt; truth=\r\ns expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language that one is\n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; &gt; =\r\namong all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as\n&gt; &gt; pow=\r\nerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nlone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, listening\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger da=\r\nys.\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a =\r\ncomplaint by householders nowadays that there\n&gt; &gt; are no good Mahatmas. Thi=\r\ns is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a\n&gt; &gt; question of supply and d=\r\nemand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will\n&gt; &gt; come at once. This=\r\n is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really\n&gt; &gt; thirsty, you will f=\r\nind your Master at your threshold. You lead a\n&gt; &gt; happy-go-lucky life, your=\r\n mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do\n&gt; &gt; not care a bit for =\r\nhigher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping\n&gt; &gt; and vain, wor=\r\nldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed,\n&gt; &gt; and nam=\r\ne and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; Make=\r\n yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, gui=\r\nde\n&gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high so=\r\nuls are\n&gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas ar=\r\ne in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are =\r\nno good\n&gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no =\r\nreal seekers\n&gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for\n&gt; &gt; Satsangha=\r\n.

However, one without a rich father is still better=\r\n off\n&gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slow=\r\nly with\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can stil=\r\nl do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account.=\r\n If you find a\n&gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly init=\r\niate you), get\n&gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for tw=\r\no purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; getting specific material results and (ii) as tool=\r\ns of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. In the case of=\r\n (ii), initiation is not that\n&gt; &gt; important. But, in the case of (i), there=\r\n are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; prepare one sufficiently. One can get in t=\r\nrouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I=\r\n said several times, there are very few people who\n&gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-day=\r\ns. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a\n&gt; &gt; reason, as Kali prog=\r\nressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for\n&gt; &gt; increasing surrend=\r\ner, getting whatever material results god wants to give\n&gt; &gt; and making spir=\r\nitual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting\n&gt; &gt; *specific* =\r\nmaterial results (for oneself or others or society/universe in\n&gt; &gt; general)=\r\n, Nature will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; suc=\r\nh rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of\n&gt; &gt; (i=\r\ni).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chand=\r\nipath or any mantra or any ritual or\n&gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitude=\r\n of &quot;I have several material desires, but\n&gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil t=\r\nhem. Because of this ritual, god may give any\n&gt; &gt; material results or spiri=\r\ntual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires.\n&gt; &gt; I will accept whate=\r\nver god gives. I want to increase my devotion and\n&gt; &gt; surrender and make sp=\r\niritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not\n&gt; &gt; required. That =\r\nattitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are\n&gt; &gt; fewer hic=\r\ncups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some\n&gt; &gt; hiccups. =\r\nI gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking\n&gt; &gt; rotte=\r\nn fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may =\r\ndo\n&gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be min=\r\nimal. If\n&gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be =\r\nmore spillage\n&gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck u=\r\nnder the rotten\n&gt; &gt; fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of yo=\r\nur karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and th=\r\nrow them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some=\r\n spillage. A gentle deity\n&gt; &gt; like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take mo=\r\nre time to get out the good\n&gt; &gt; fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A =\r\nfierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have mo=\r\nre spillage, but the good fruit\n&gt; &gt; comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you woul=\r\nd&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good frui=\r\nts!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to=\r\n take some of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; &gt; fruits is better off avoiding fier=\r\nce deities such as Chandi and staying with\n&gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiati=\r\non if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a\n&gt; &gt; guru before starting a p=\r\nractice. If you realize the above, you can start\n&gt; &gt; mantras without initia=\r\ntion. If some bad results occut, you have to realize\n&gt; &gt; that it is a fruit=\r\n of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate\n&gt; &gt; good results=\r\n. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life an=\r\nd were\n&gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who =\r\ntook several\n&gt; &gt; hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years=\r\n back are now\n&gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I kno=\r\nw that some of them\n&gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and have experienced some th=\r\nings too. Obviously, they\n&gt; &gt; have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of th=\r\ne Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; &gt; Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialis=\r\nm, if someone\n&gt; &gt; has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is importan=\r\nt, is looking for\n&gt; &gt; god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (=\r\ne.g. Chandipath), that\n&gt; &gt; person obviously has some good karmas and good v=\r\nasanas. That person has done\n&gt; &gt; that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s =\r\nsadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what is what, how\n&gt; &gt; things wor=\r\nk, why one should do something, how to do it, what is more\n&gt; &gt; important an=\r\nd what is less important, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; H.Ramalingam\n&gt; \n&gt; Managing Director\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nShri Ramana Heavy Engineering Private Limited\n&gt; \n&gt; No.769, 59th Street, 10t=\r\nh Sector, K.K.nagar\n&gt; \n&gt; Chennai-600078\n&gt; \n&gt; Ph: Off-044-23662346\n&gt; \n&gt; Cell=\r\n: +91-93847 41969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99620 31969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99406 51969\n&gt; \n&gt; Email: hra=\r\nmalingam@...\n&gt; \n&gt; hramalingam@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
