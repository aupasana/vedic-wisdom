Thou =\r\nart dear to the Lord. That is the reason why He gives troubles. If He wants=\r\n to take anyone to His side, He takes away all money. He removes his dear k=\r\nith and kin. He destroys all his pleasure-centres, so that his mind may ful=\r\nly rest at His Lotus-Feet. Face everything with a smiling, cheerful counten=\r\nance. Understand His mysterious ways. See God in everything, in every face-=\r\nout of sight, but not out of mind. We are closer when we live physically at=\r\n a distance. Let us dwell in our hearts. Krishna suddenly hides Himself, so=\r\n that Radha and the Gopis might thirst for Him more eagerly. Sing like Radh=\r\na. Thirst like Gopis for his vision. Krishna&#39;s grace is bound to descend. H=\r\ne is thy Immortal Friend. Forget not the Flute-Bearer of Brindavan, thy Sol=\r\nace and the joy of Devaki. \n\n\n"}}
