If Mother decides, She can convert anybody into a great saint in a split second. I am glad you and your parents have taken important steps and good luck.\n \nEach being has a different background and different conditioning and hence a different purpose to serve in the world. We do not know what is right for us, but Mother does. As we plead with her to help us, She gives us exactly what is needed by us for progressing spiritually, pay off the kaarmik debts and become free. One person may first need material stability to progress spiritually. One person may need to give up material life and go to a monastery. One person may need to become affluent and construct temples. The kaarmik forces are driving each person in different paths. Mother finds the best course for each person to reach the same place based on where they are and what their momentum is.\n \nShe may give money to one person to provide some stability so that the person does sadhana without distractions. She may give money to another person to test him and see if his focus on god wavers. She is the Director with the full script of the movie, while we are two cent actors who act in one or two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie.\n \nI suggest not worrying too much about any specifics. Just learn to think that the Mother (or Father if you prefer that way, because Father and Mother are not really two different *people* but two different personifications of the same Force that runs the universe) knows what is best and we need to do what we can and accept what She gives us. Try to develop an equanimous state of mind where you accept anything She gives you (riches or poverty, health or sickness, fame or ridicule) with an equal vision.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;

wrote: \n&gt; Pranam Guruji,\n&gt; and to all my seniors,\n&gt; \n&gt; i just want to share few of my experiences that i am undergoing and wish to share it with all of my respected fellow friends in here.. i with three other friends of mine have visited Venaras (kashi) during the last week of January 2010. we visited the Manikarnika shamshan and all possible temples that we had planned to visit.. just before going there i had a set frame of mind  that when i will come back to home .. in Kolkata (Calcutta) i&#39;ll be starting Maha Ganapati  homam.. atleast in the weekends if not .. regularly as i was having a very bad situation both financially and in the home front as well .. i brought a Baneshwar from there as well. while coming back to home i was severely ill and was having Fever with stomach upset as well... i didnt bother much about my health as i had a feeling may be its coz of the past bad karmas i am facing it ..since i have been lucky enough in getting guidance from two of Manish ji&#39;s direct disciples.. my friend who\n&gt;  have been doing Ganapati homam for quite a long time and now he is doing Chandi homam.. showed me how to do it ,,and there again i met another friend of mine who is regular in doing Chandi homams who inspired me to start as well... i was very tensed to start off as i didnt had even that much of money to start off regularly.. and there again i was a bit tensed about how my parents would react to the things like .. i am turning out to be a veg and will be doing homams on a regular basis.. where as my income was nil at that time .. !!\n&gt; \n&gt; now comes the suprises as follows:-\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Manish ji  called up my friend who was staying in my home ,who was staying in my home .. after we had returned .. from Venaras..\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I was so happy and excited about the fact that without even knowing .. how .. i just took the decision .. that i am going to start ..my Homams DAILY.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) To my  very surprise.. my parents did not objected, to my decision of doing Homams on a regular basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The very 1st day i did my homam.. i got a call for regular work.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) By profession i am an Actor / Anchor .. so i dont have any permanent salaried job..it implies of a inconsistent income .. now .. i get calls for a lot works regularly .. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6) My mom started to recite Chandi ..path regularly and the biggest of all suprises.. my Dad who never was so much into spirituality is starting Saptashloki Chandi path .,,\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) In total.. i got very fast results ..of my homams..and was lucky and blessed enough to help two others to start Ganapati homams regularly ..all the problems that i have been facing for a long time .. does not exists right now .. at all... \n&gt; \n&gt; Right now .. i am preparing . for Chandi homam.. and trying to my best of possibilities.. to read the 13 chapters of Chandi fluently ..\n&gt; \n&gt; now i have a question to my respected seniors...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) i am happy that my monetary problem .. is solving very fast .. but in no way i was, nor am i now .. attached to the mundane.. and earthly materialistic desires...so i am a bit confused.. that getting earthly benefits ..without even asking for it.. in the homam.. hope is not a way or a procedure.. to deviate me .. from.. the sadhana.. i mean getting very fast results from .. the homam.. is it a way God is testing me ????\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) plz do correct me ,.., if at any place .. i am wrong and incorrect ,., \n&gt; \n&gt; i beg of mercy .. if i have said anything wrong .. i dont know much . and just a beginner.. its just my devotion and faith are all that i have.. while doing my homams..and i am sure .. i do a plenty of mistakes in my steps.. while doing the homam..but i am thankful that God has been merciful enough to forgive me and bless...i am enjoying my state of bliss..and after a very long search .. i think this is  the right way meant for ..me .. my life has changed..and i hope it will be the same or even more.. for the new friends who are yet to come.. i did three homams at a stretch today for the 1st time and i am happy for that fact very much ,, \n&gt; Despite of the factor. that i havent been lucky enough . to meet or even to interact with   Manish ji ..  i think of him as my Guru .. and i feel blessed at all times..\n&gt; and a special thanks to Rajarshi da and Arnab ,, \n&gt; \n&gt; regards sayantan, \n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Maa ! \n\n\n"}}
