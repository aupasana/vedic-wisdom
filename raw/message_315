Very correct..\n   \n  I personally feel a terrific devotion for Ramakrishna Paramhamsa and Lahiri Mahasaya.. not that the other saints any less..(it is foolish for us to compare them).. but Ramakrishna Paramhamsa i find to be just amazing.. specially if  u read that book by Sri Saradananda where a lot of details is mentioned about thakur&#39;s sadhana days.. its mind boggling..\n  and Lahiri Mahasays.. what a man.. what a yogi.. being a houselholder goign to these heights.. oh my god.. its just too much..!\n   \n  -Regards\n   Rajarshi\n\nkumar_gh_2000 &lt;kumar_gh_2000@...&gt; wrote:\n          Dear Rajarshiji,\nThank you very much for the response. Sometimes I feel I missed the \ngolden era(1800- early 1900). It was the time many saints were born. \nSri Shirdi Saibaba, Sri Swami Samarth(Akkalkot maharaj), Sri Ramana \nMaharshi, Sri Tajuddin baba, Sri Bhagavan Nityananda, Nisargadatta \nMaharaj, Ramakrishna parmahansa, Trilinga swami, Lahiri baba, \nYukteswara Maharaj, Pakalapati guruji and many other saints were \nborn in that golden era. I too accept that the presence of the \nsaints just near to us is highly benificial than anything. However \nstill many people near to those saints didn&#39;t use those great saints \nhelp. Sri Shirdi Saibaba himself told that everybody was coming to \nhim for material wealth and nobody was asking spiritual wealth. In \nmy opinion, if we pray sincerely, even now also those saints will \nrespond to us. In my observation, devotion with other kinds of \nmeditation gives excellent results. Combination of strong conviction \non guru or god, meditation on beingness(I like pranayama, vipasana, \nand zen too), chanting of the powerful Gayatri Mantra or any other \nmantras we are connected gives highly benificial results. Finally it \nleads us to sarwasya saranagati and complete detachment. As human \nmind needs variety, we can increase our sadhana time by trying all \nthese different approaches. \nIndeed this is also great time. As technology advanced \nvery well with internet and computers, now we can have a great \nawareness on many spiritual topics. We can read and analyze about \nvarious kinds of spiritual practises and choose which one fits best \nto our temper irrespective of religion. \n\nHowever as sri Sivananda swami told as ounce of \npractise is better than tons of theory. Let us practise, practise, \npractise until being one with oneness.\n\n\nThanks and Regards\nKumar Ghanta\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Kumar,\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes &quot;I am that&quot; is a wonderful book.

Anyone who has ever tried even a minutest \nfraction \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; sadhana not to gain a better happy life but to get that one \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; fraction of an inch closer to God will know the millions of \n&gt; troubles \n&gt; &gt; and frustation that come in the path. It was on one such moment \n&gt; when \n&gt; &gt; I came across this writing and felt humbled. Ganapati Muni was \n&gt; known \n&gt; &gt; as a siddha who had done terrific, i repeat terrific amount of \n&gt; &gt; penances, even before he met Sri Ramana Maharishi.

One day he was assailed by pains, \n&gt; &gt; troubles, doubts. He remembered that the young Swami was on the \n&gt; &gt; hill, and at midday, a little after noon, he climbed and found \nhim \n&gt; &gt; sitting outside Virupaksha cave, alone. He prostrated and \n&gt; said, &quot;All \n&gt; &gt; the scriptures that have to be read, I have read. All the \nmantras \n&gt; &gt; and japa that have to be done, I have done. Still I have no \npeace. \n&gt; &gt; Please save me.&quot; The young Swami took a little time. For at \nleast \n&gt; &gt; fifteen minutes he silently gazed at him. Then in Tamil, he \nspoke. \n&gt; &gt; The English translation is simple:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If one watches whence the notion &#39;I&#39; arises, the mind is \nabsorbed \n&gt; &gt; in That; that is tapas.
