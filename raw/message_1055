True, some damage has been done, but it is =\r\nstill standing tall &lt;BR&gt;and firm &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough. Isn&#39;t it amazing?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In fact, Hinduism is a word coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;correct term &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is &quot;sanatana dharma&quot;, i.e. perennial spirit of rig=\r\nhteousness. By &lt;BR&gt;definition, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it is perennial. I am firmly convin=\r\nced that it cannot be destroyed. &lt;BR&gt;Even if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it seems close to ext=\r\ninction, it will come back up. That is the &lt;BR&gt;nature of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this dhar=\r\nma. I am not worried about Sanatana dharma being damaged &lt;BR&gt;or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; de=\r\nstroyed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I will continue to discharge what *I* believe nat=\r\nure expects from &lt;BR&gt;*me* and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what I believe is *my* dharma, witho=\r\nut any worry whatsoever that &lt;BR&gt;sanatana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma is in some kind o=\r\nf danger of extinction. However, such a &lt;BR&gt;belief is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vital for so=\r\nme people to discharge *their* dharma and hence we have\n &lt;BR&gt;some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\npeople driven by that sense of danger and the resulting fear and &lt;BR&gt;anger.=\r\n That &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is ok too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sadguru S=\r\namartha Ramadas is not an ordinary soul. He is born with &lt;BR&gt;an amsa of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Lord Hanuman. His words may be slightly misunderstood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; To somebody like him, it would not matter whether a nation calls &lt;BR&gt;its=\r\nelf &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hindu or secular or whatever. What would matter is whether dha=\r\nrma &lt;BR&gt;is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; followed or not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Right now, we do not =\r\nhave sanatana dharma being followed in any &lt;BR&gt;country, in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; secular=\r\n India or in Hindu Nepal or in many other countries &lt;BR&gt;following &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nsecularism or various religions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If it is indeed God&#39;s wis=\r\nh that sanatana dharma be established in &lt;BR&gt;the world, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it will ha=\r\nppen when its time comes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ---------\n --------- --------- --------- -&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spir=\r\nituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nvedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.=\r\nVedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJag=\r\nan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n From=\r\n: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@ yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 6:14 AM&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Hindu Rastra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Memb=\r\ners&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was hearing of a famous sentence attributed=\r\n to Swami Ramdas who &lt;BR&gt;had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told Shivaji &quot;hindavi swarajya wh=\r\nave...hi shrrenchi ichcha&quot;..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Which means, to have=\r\n a Hindu Rastra is God&#39;s desire.
