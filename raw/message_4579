The meth=\r\nod\nof practice here is only to let go of that oppressive spirit. Here we ca=\r\nn\nfor once at least experience the truth of Patanjali&#39;s aphorism: &quot;Yoga is\n=\r\ncontrol of the modifications of the mind.&quot;\n\nHis Routine\n\nEven at the first =\r\ncrow of the cock, the Sage leaves his bed and goes to the\nhill to answer th=\r\ne calls of nature. At four o&#39;clock he is engaged in the\nroutine of the day.=\r\n The first thing the Sage does every day is to chop\nvegetables. Sometimes h=\r\ne himself prepares the morning meal. There is no\nconflict between jnana and=\r\n daily work. Bodily labour is not degrading. To\nteach this truth about work=\r\n is the Sage&#39;s motive.\n\nWhen the first bell rings at five, the Sage is seat=\r\ned at ease upon the sofa.\nThe disciples now begin to enter the hall, and as=\r\n the cool morning breeze,\ncharged with the light of dawn is lightly stirrin=\r\ng, the Vedic recitation\nbegins. The students of the Ashram school raise the=\r\nir voices with so much\nfeeling and chant with such devotion that there is n=\r\no one who will not be\novercome by it. And for a time it is as though the Di=\r\nvine Mother of India&#39;s\neternal spirituality dances before us. The ladies wh=\r\no had left the Ashram\nthe previous night, now return. The Maharshi goes for=\r\n his bath, and at\nhalf-past seven the bell rings. Together with the guests =\r\nand inmates the\nSage takes two rice-cakes and half a cup of coffee. After t=\r\nhis he comes to\nthe hall. The sadhakas engage in their sadhana before him. =\r\nSome go about the\nwork of the Ashram. The Vedic students attend to the work=\r\n and worship of the\ntemple, as the devotees come and receive the silent ble=\r\nssings and are\nsatisfied.\n\nLunch will be over by noon, afternoon coffee by =\r\nthree. The Sage will be\npresent in the hall from three till supper time at =\r\neight P.M. He goes out\nonce towards the cowshed in the morning and once by =\r\nthe adjoining sadhus.\ngarden in the afternoon to ease himself. So few are h=\r\nis movements. At five\nin the afternoon music begins from the radio in the h=\r\nall. The songs of\nTyagaraja, the poet, singer-bhakta, siddha, can be heard =\r\nwith enjoyment. The\nSage is a lover of the fine arts. He is an aesthete who=\r\n can appreciate the\nsweetness of music.\n\nIn the evening of the first day I =\r\noffered him my composition, titled Govinda\nRamayana. For a while he read it=\r\n to himself here and there. Reading the\nprose colophon he remarked, &quot;He too=\r\n is of Parashara gotra.&quot; It seemed as\nthough this Sage who has sprung from =\r\nParashara gotra was a little pleased at\nthis. When I mentioned that my mate=\r\nrnal gotra was also Bharadwaja, the same\nas his, a little further pleasure =\r\nwas visible. When I told him that I was\nputting the entire Ramayana in vers=\r\ne, I felt that the Sage blessed me.\n\nTowards the evening there is the Vedic=\r\n recitation once again. After this the\ndevotees sing the praises of the Sag=\r\ne and his verses. For a while after\nsupper the Sage is immersed in samadhi,=\r\n his devotees with him. Such is the\ndaily routine.\n\nHe Rules by Silence\n\nI =\r\nstayed for three days and only once or twice a day was his sweet voice\nhear=\r\nd. He rules all through silence only. I drew near that sea of love and\npros=\r\ntrating said, &quot;I take leave. Bless me.&quot; The Sage nodded his head in\nassent =\r\nand blessing. He looked on me for once to my heart&#39;s content with his\ngraci=\r\nous countenance. Somehow my foot was unable to move back, arrested by\nthe p=\r\nower of that stupefying arrow. I again prostrated. I felt he told me,\n&quot;Now =\r\nyou may depart.&quot; I came out from the Sage&#39;s hall with peace in my\nheart. I =\r\nsaid to myself, &quot;I am blessed.&quot; I left the Ashram pondering the\nwords of Bh=\r\navatrihari:\n\n&quot;When I knew a little I was blinded by pride as an elephant by=\r\n rut,and my\nmind was covered over by the thought, &#39;I know everything&#39;. But =\r\nwhen through\nthe company of the enlightened I learned little by little, the=\r\nn I found that\nI was a fool and the fever of my pride departed.&quot;\n\nIt seemed=\r\n as though my heart had been graven with Bhavatrihari&#39;s lines:\n\n&quot;Some inner=\r\n cause brings things together. Attachments are by no means\ngrounded in exte=\r\nrnal causes.&quot; The hairs of my body stood on end. With the\nsilent words, &#39;I =\r\nam thy servant,&#39; I offered the great Sage my heartfelt\nadorations.\n\nSource:=\r\n http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2008/?pg=3Dmar-apr#article.1\n\n-- \n=\r\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e659f444c4abea048a122c70\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe Upanishadic line: &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Min=\r\nd alone is the cause of bondage and liberation of men&lt;/span&gt;,&quot; rises f=\r\nrom my heart and dances in the pathway of the mind.
