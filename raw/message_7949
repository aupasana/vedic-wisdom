Thi=\r\ns is a loaded question, \nbut I will share a few random thoughts on this and=\r\n several related \ntopics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I =\r\nwill be writing \non how NOT to try to recognize it!\n\nIf you don&#39;t like my 2=\r\n cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow \nyour gurus and others who=\r\nm you may prefer.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMATERIAL RESULTS\n\nOne obvious thing=\r\n is that some people get material benefits, like \nmarriage, job, promotion,=\r\n childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases \nfaith in the initial stages =\r\nand makes one continue sadhana.\n\nHowever, that may not happen to everyone. =\r\nMoreover, such material \nresults do not necessarily show spiritual progress=\r\n. So, how do we \nidentify spiritual progress?\n\n*        *        *\n\nGOAL OF=\r\n SADHANA\n\nSpiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized=\r\n in \nscriptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it al=\r\nl \nboils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, \nattachme=\r\nnts and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the \nmind. How free=\r\n we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and \novercome this i=\r\nnnate conditioning.\n\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in &quot;Yoga Vaasishth=\r\nam&quot; that \nSelf-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined=\r\n Yoga \n(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; as &quot;yogaH chitta vRtti nirodh=\r\naH&quot; \n(Communion is resisting the working of conditioning).\n\nThis conditioni=\r\nng inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, \nwe can deflate the=\r\n ego completely and then identify with the entire \nuniverse, instead of a s=\r\ningle entity with a single agenda.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIDENTIFYING CONDIT=\r\nIONING\n\nInnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines=\r\n our \nlikes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike=\r\n) \nsome people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things \nt=\r\nhough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those \nthi=\r\nngs. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated \nover man=\r\ny lives.\n\nWhen someone praises us, we may know that it is irrelevant (our i=\r\nnner \nvoice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone puts us \n=\r\ndown, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us so) \nand =\r\nyet we may feel offended and feel like doing something about it. All \nthis =\r\ncomes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over many \nlives.\n\nIdne=\r\ntifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, \ncalculati=\r\nons and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key \nis to lear=\r\nn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the \ninner voice of =\r\nconscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled \nfrom inside to do o=\r\ntherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of \nconditioning. We often =\r\nsuppress the inner voice of conscience and obey \nthe inner voice of our con=\r\nditioning.\n\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical o=\r\nr mental \n- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it means our \nco=\r\nnditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of \nspi=\r\nritual progress. This may in general be difficult for others to \njudge, but=\r\n one can certainly judge for oneself.\n\nThe tricky thing is that our self-an=\r\nalysis and self-judgment is also \ncontrolled by our conditioning!! Suppose =\r\nI engaged in an action against \nmy inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze w=\r\nhat just happened and whether \nI violated my inner voice of conscience. Tha=\r\nt whole process is governed \nby the conditioning too. Depending on how deep=\r\nly I am conditioned to \nthink that I am a good person doing the right thing=\r\n and not making a \nmistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voi=\r\nce of conscience \nas a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance.=\r\n Instead, it \nwill focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts o=\r\nut from \ninside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I d=\r\nid the \nright thing.\n\nThe grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome in =\r\na day or two! But, \nthe inner voice of conscience does tell everyone when o=\r\nne is doing \nsomething wrong under the influence of conditioning. If one ke=\r\neps \ntrying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome conditioning.\n\n* =\r\n       *        *\n\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCES\n\nSometimes, as one makes spiritual p=\r\nrogress, one may have super-normal or \nmystical or out-of-body experiences,=\r\n visions and dreams.\n\nFor example, one person I know started to feel very l=\r\night in the head \nwith a vision of bright light of a particular color, when=\r\n he meditated \nwith a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a=\r\n big fire at \nthe base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (=\r\nhe actually \nfelt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra=\r\n. Another \nperson saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked t=\r\no him. \nInterestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was al=\r\nso \nsitting there at the same time and that person had a totally different =\r\n\n(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the same \nti=\r\nme. Another person felt like he became very light and was floating in \nair =\r\nand there was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, one \nsadhaka whe=\r\nn meditating was filled with the sense that his job was done \non earth and =\r\nhe could now leave. He thought, &quot;let me leave and let me \ntake some more wi=\r\nth me&quot;. He felt like he was a point moving up with a \ntremendous speed. At =\r\nthe same time, another person who was meditating a \nfew feet away in front =\r\nof a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling \nthat person forcibly throug=\r\nh a cave and felt really overwhelmed.\n\nThere are so many possible experienc=\r\nes. But the key point is that \nexperiences are secondary. They are NEITHER =\r\nNECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for \nspiritual progress. I had my share of experie=\r\nnces, progress and setbacks \nand I am 100% sure of the above. You&#39;ll do wel=\r\nl to remember this \nsentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or=\r\n desire them \nconsciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later=\r\n on the \ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPER=\r\nIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION\n\nWe say that god can be known only by exper=\r\nience and not by reading \nbooks. That is not incorrect. However, when one i=\r\ns deeply desirous of an \nexperience, one may experience an aspect of god&#39;s =\r\nDelusory Power instead \nof god and that may increase false pride (a true ex=\r\nperience of god will \ninstead produce infinite humility). Not all experienc=\r\nes are equal.\n\nThere is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better th=\r\nan a ton of \ntheory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even=\r\n a ton of \nexperience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a t=\r\non of \ntheory may actually be better if it actually reduces one&#39;s ego to a =\r\n\npound or an ounce!\n\nThe issue is not whether one needs practical experienc=\r\ne or theoretical \nunderstanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is wh=\r\nat is happening \nto one&#39;s ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is =\r\nundoubtedly \nthe main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretic=\r\nal \nunderstanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to=\r\n \na pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct experience, \n=\r\nthat&#39;s awesome. That is better than getting a ton of experience and ego \nbe=\r\ning inflated from a pound to a quintal.\n\nThough it is true that ego does no=\r\nt become complete zero without an \n&quot;experience&quot; of god in the end, it is st=\r\nill a bad idea to seek that \n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego is still a ton or =\r\na quintal. First reduce it \nto as small a quantity as you can. Experience o=\r\nf god will then come by \nitself.\n\nIn the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, th=\r\nere is a nice line: &quot;Don&#39;t \nchase success, but chase capability. Success wi=\r\nll follow automatically.&quot; \nSimilarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase de=\r\ntachment and deflation \nof ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasi=\r\nng experience without \ntrying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before=\r\n the horse. To use \nthe analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one then runs th=\r\ne risk of \nbecoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias Si=\r\nlencer) \nof that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego from lim=\r\nited \nsuccess and failed in the end!\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCE AND C=\r\nONDITIONING\n\nAs said above, it is a bad idea to seek an &quot;experience&quot; when o=\r\nne&#39;s ego \nis still a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one&#39;s condition=\r\ning is \ndense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be \ncounter-pro=\r\nductive. The reason is that any experience will be \ninterpreted (and absorb=\r\ned into one&#39;s system!!!) through the color of \none&#39;s conditioning.\n\nIf I go=\r\n into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see \nthat Sun is=\r\n orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass \nwindows of a hous=\r\ne. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through \ngreen eyeglasses. In=\r\n either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am \nexperiencing the real Sun=\r\n, but I will get the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun \nis green&quot;.\n\nSimilarly, even=\r\n a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN \ngenerate false know=\r\nledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one&#39;s conditioning is \nconducive (e.g. green =\r\neyeglasses!).\n\nThe key is not just to experience, but the ability to interp=\r\net, *digest* \nand absorb the experience into one&#39;s system well. One&#39;s condi=\r\ntioning \ninfluences how one digests various life experiences, including spi=\r\nritual \nexperiences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in=\r\n the \nabove example!\n\n*        *        *\n\nDIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES\n\nIn ayu=\r\nrvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic \nbuildup in =\r\nthe system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various \ntissues and =\r\ncreate various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and \nfeel healthy d=\r\nespite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one \ndevelops serious =\r\ndiseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts \nof the body. The a=\r\nma may even interfere with the digestion of good food \nbeing taken in and t=\r\nhe working of even medicines one may take in. When \ntoo much ama has accumu=\r\nlated and destabilizes the system, one may need \nto go through a painful de=\r\n-toxification process.\n\nSimilarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest =\r\nwell become spiritual \nama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can sl=\r\nowly build up, get \nabsorbed into various aspects of one&#39;s being and create=\r\n various diseases \nin the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and=\r\n feel \nspiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritua=\r\nl \nama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can \nev=\r\nentually affect one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for \nde-tox=\r\nification) may be far more difficult than the physical \npancha-karma.\n\n*   =\r\n     *        *\n\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS\n\nTo illustrate what I mean by spi=\r\nritual ama and delusions, let me give a \n*hypothetical* example.\n\nSuppose s=\r\nomeone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates. \nSuppose one star=\r\nts to get some special inner experiences and some \nseemingly supernatural t=\r\nhings start happening externally around one. \nSuppose these experiences giv=\r\ne one the impression that one is special \nand one is making excellent spiri=\r\ntual progress. Suppose one reads some \nspiritual books and fantasizes &quot;beco=\r\nming like Shiva&quot; mentioned in those \nbooks. Then one may start to think &quot;ma=\r\ny be, I have become like Shiva&quot; \nand slowly convince oneself that one HAS b=\r\necome like Shiva. Suppose one \nreads a spiritual book that claims &quot;If one b=\r\necomes like Shiva, the whole \nuniverse connives against one who causes an o=\r\nffense to him&quot;.\n\nOf course, there is a context behind every statement and n=\r\no statement is \nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and abs=\r\norb it into \none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said,=\r\n &quot;if one \nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one=\r\n and \nthere is no way anyone can really cause offense to that person&quot;.\n\nAny=\r\nway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one has indeed \nbecome l=\r\nike Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing offense \nand suffer=\r\ning bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shapes in \nclouds, one =\r\ncan find any correlations in things happening around one. \nOne will find a =\r\nfew examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one \nhas become like Shi=\r\nva. When good and bad happen to people around one, \none may start correlati=\r\nng them to good and bad done by those people to \none and/or to things one h=\r\nas done. Over time, the delusion may become so \ndeep that it just feels so =\r\nnatural and obvious. This is like a serious \ndisease developing from a toxi=\r\nc buildup of undigested or badly digested \nfood. Inability to fully underst=\r\nand the spiritual experiences one had, \nthe fantasy of becoming like Shiva,=\r\n the pre-exising pride (like \npre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digeste=\r\nd notion that offense to \nShiva causes harm, have together created spiritua=\r\nl ama buildup that now \nresulted in a serious disease.\n\nThough original exp=\r\neriences may have been genuine, experiences coming \nlater on MAY be the res=\r\nult of accumulated delusions (disease) from the \nill-digested experiences a=\r\nnd notions (ama). Please note that ama is \nconducive to creating more ama. =\r\nWhen unchecked, disease in one part of \nthe system can spread to others.\n\nA=\r\ns said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or \ndeflated. =\r\nIf ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track. \nOne is either =\r\ndeluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due \nto pre-existing =\r\nconditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either \ncase, whatever one i=\r\ns experiencing is not being digested well and is \nweakening the system inst=\r\nead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, \nego is getting deflated, t=\r\nhen one is on the right track. Whatever one is \nexperiencing is being diges=\r\nted well and strengthening the system.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSHAKTI, SIDDHI=\r\nS AND MIRACLES\n\nThis emphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder =\r\nabout the \nprominence given in some books to accumulation of shakti, siddhi=\r\ns and \nmiracles. For example, some books describe what a being like Shiva o=\r\nr \nsomeone less but still with high enough shakti, can do.\n\nYes, SOME enlig=\r\nhtened beings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY \nhave a lot of spir=\r\nitual shakti and be able to do some special things. \nBut, no book said that=\r\n you get those abilities by being proud or \npursuing something that can mak=\r\ne one proud.\n\nIn fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books a=\r\nnd adores \nthem from one&#39;s *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is qu=\r\nite akin \nto looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from green eyeglasses and admiring th=\r\ne \ngreenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point.=\r\n \nOne with dense conditioning can&#39;t even understand what that shakti or \nab=\r\nility really means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti \nis, t=\r\no accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST \ndeflate one&#39;=\r\ns ego.\n\nBottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous=\r\n in \nteaching the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No =\r\n\nscripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It&#39;s as \nsimpl=\r\ne as that.\n\n*        *        *\n\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS\n\n=\r\nWe encounter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses \na=\r\nnd also conversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime \ncom=\r\ning from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine \nbeings=\r\n supposedly said is well within what one consciously or \nsub-consciously al=\r\nready knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nThis may remind one of the en=\r\ncounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character \nplayed by Sanjay Dutt in hit b=\r\nollywood movie &quot;Lage Rahe Munnabhai&quot;. In \nthat movie, the visions are due t=\r\no &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in Munnabhai&#39;s \nmind and the Gandhi he sees and can =\r\ntalk to, cannot answer questions \nthat Munnabhai himself does not know (but=\r\n real Gandhi should know). So \nthe conclusion is that the person Munnabhai =\r\nimagines seeing is a \ncharacter in his own mind constructed based on what M=\r\nunnabhai \nunderstands of Gandhi.\n\nIn the case of divine encounters, it may =\r\nbe a little different from this \nmovie. It MAY be a divine being one truly =\r\nfancied meeting based on all \nthat one consciously and sub-consciously knew=\r\n already, OR it may be a \nreal being. Even in the latter case, the being an=\r\nd his/her actions are \ninterpreted strictly based on one&#39;s conditioning, li=\r\nke the &quot;green Sun&quot; \nin our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, =\r\nwhat divine \nbeings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one conscio=\r\nusly or \nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nIn=\r\n the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a \nreal di=\r\nvine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or \nfather, and=\r\n there is a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and \nwisdom.\n\nAga=\r\nin, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be \nde-conditioned eno=\r\nugh to really benefit from it!\n\n*        *        *\n\nKUNDALINI AWAKENING & =\r\nRISE\n\nOne more thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and ris=\r\ne. \nKundalini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this =\r\n\nis &quot;I&quot;). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not \ne=\r\nven question who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties \nse=\r\nlf down to the physical body and physical senses. However, \nself-awareness =\r\nrising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual \nprogress or enlighte=\r\nnment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of \na long process. If one=\r\n&#39;s conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle \nideas of who one is (e.g.=\r\n I am a great spiritual soul who saved the \nworld many times in the past an=\r\nd came back to save it), an awakened \nKundalini may take one&#39;s notion of se=\r\nlf beyond the physical body, but \nwill get stuck somewhere else. In fact, o=\r\nne&#39;s subtle notions of self may \nbecome aggrandized when Kundalini reaches =\r\nconducive regions and one may \nexperience things that aggravate and strengt=\r\nhen those notions. One may \nget badly stuck.\n\nAs mentioned above, any spiri=\r\ntual experience can create spiritual ama \nwhen not digested properly. Any p=\r\nre-existing conditioning may make it \ndifficult to digest anything complex.=\r\n Instead of eating a heavy-duty \nprotein bar that one cannot digest and get=\r\nting toxic buildup in the \nsystem, one is better off eating simple food tha=\r\nt one&#39;s own system can \nprocess and digest well.\n\nTo be clear, whether one&#39;=\r\ns Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one&#39;s \nKundalini is currently, is=\r\n NOT a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress. As \nKundalini does not rise thr=\r\nough a single path, as the rise is not linear \nand as the obstructions are =\r\nnot uniform in all people, one cannot \ncompare two people based on Kundalin=\r\ni experiences.\n\nOne can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slo=\r\nwly and \noneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Ano=\r\nther \nperson may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it i=\r\ns \nextremely difficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.\n\nThe bot=\r\ntomline is that how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced \none&#39;s eg=\r\no is is the correct measure of spiritual progress and not \nwhether Kundalin=\r\ni is awakened and where Kundalini is.\n\n*        *        *\n\nCORRELATIONS GA=\r\nLORE\n\nDo not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or ma=\r\ny \nnot mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, &quot;wow, I was \n=\r\njust thinking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something and someone says, \n&quot;=\r\nwow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read \nmy m=\r\nind.&quot; Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in some region of \nthe w=\r\norld, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened \nthere. Or s=\r\nuppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did some \nsadhana and the=\r\n desire was fulfilled.\n\nIn several such cases, correlating a result with so=\r\nmething you did can \noften increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And=\r\n, doing that will \nnot enable you to do your dharma any better.\n\nKeep think=\r\ning your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and \nkeep doing your=\r\n sadhana. That&#39;s it. Don&#39;t correlate actions and results \nand think that yo=\r\nu made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and \ngod gives results. T=\r\nhe sense of &quot;I made X happen&quot; is conducive to pride \nand ego inflation. Mor=\r\neover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether \naction A or B caused result=\r\n X or Y, because the action-result pipeline \nhas variable delay!! So, why e=\r\nven bother to correlate and run the risk \nof ego inflation?\n\n*        *    =\r\n    *\n\nBOTTOMLINE\n\nDon&#39;t run after special experiences and special abilitie=\r\ns or anything \nthat makes you special (as you imagine currently, based on y=\r\nour dense \nconditioning). Spiritual progress is not about becoming &quot;special=\r\n&quot;, but \nabout becoming humble. Special experiences and abilities do not mat=\r\nter \nat all. In fact, they can distract one and give false pride. God makes=\r\n \none special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost completely.\n\nAlso,=\r\n stop correlating things happening to or around you, with your \nactions, an=\r\nd think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is \nyour sacred =\r\nduty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time is \ngod&#39;s prerogat=\r\nive. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe \nin one&#39;s thinkin=\r\ng.\n\nRemember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of \nspiri=\r\ntual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become \n(not h=\r\now humble you act or behave, but how humble you have really become \ninterna=\r\nlly). It is how well you are able to resist the temptations of \nfollowing t=\r\nhe voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how \nwell you can fo=\r\nllow the voice of conscience.\n\nWhen inflations in ego occur, it is the job =\r\nof a guru/mentor to notice \nit, bring it to the attention and perhaps even =\r\nbe ruthless in belling \nthe cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not=\r\n do that well. So, \nyou have to do your best to avoid any serious ego infla=\r\ntions.\n\nUnfortunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization =\r\nIS \nvery very very likely for most of us to include many many many \nopportu=\r\nnities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict \nwatch on=\r\n your ego.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf I offended anybody with some strong ass=\r\nertions in this email, my \napologies.\n\nOm Tat Sat.\n\nKrishnarapanamstu,\nNara=\r\nsimha\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyoti=\r\nsh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritua=\r\nl manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings\nTwitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n\n \r\n--798208272-590979030-1330495199=:54013\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-fa=\r\nmily: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif=\r\n; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jay shree krshna !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-fami=\r\nly: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear=\r\n Beautiful soul !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;n=\r\new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Your wisdom filled message made the morning more beautiful and mo=\r\nre&nbsp;blissful.

This is a loaded questi=\r\non, &lt;br&gt;\nbut I will share a few random thoughts on this and several related=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\ntopics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writ=\r\ning &lt;br&gt;\non how NOT to try to recognize it!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you don&#39;t like my 2=\r\n cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow &lt;br&gt;\nyour gurus and others=\r\n whom you may prefer.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMATERIAL RESULT=\r\nS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, lik=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\nmarriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increas=\r\nes &lt;br&gt;\nfaith in the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nHowever, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such material &lt;br&gt;\nre=\r\nsults do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we &lt;br&gt;\nidenti=\r\nfy spiritual progress?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGOAL OF SADHAN=\r\nA&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSpiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterize=\r\nd in &lt;br&gt;\nscriptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, =\r\nit all &lt;br&gt;\nboils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nattachments and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nmind. How free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\novercome this innate conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught=\r\n Lord Rama in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that &lt;br&gt;\nSelf-realization means overcomin=\r\ng conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga &lt;br&gt;\n(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga =\r\nSutras&quot; as &quot;yogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n(Communion is resisting the w=\r\norking of conditioning).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis conditioning inflates ego and by ove=\r\nrcoming all the conditioning, &lt;br&gt;\nwe can deflate the ego completely and th=\r\nen identify with the entire &lt;br&gt;\nuniverse, instead of a single entity with =\r\na single agenda.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIDENTIFYING CONDITIO=\r\nNING&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nInnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what dete=\r\nrmines our &lt;br&gt;\nlikes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (=\r\nor dislike) &lt;br&gt;\nsome people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) =\r\nsome things &lt;br&gt;\nthough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or=\r\n to do) those &lt;br&gt;\nthings. All this comes from conditioning, which has been=\r\n accumulated &lt;br&gt;\nover many lives.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen someone praises us, we may=\r\n know that it is irrelevant (our inner &lt;br&gt;\nvoice tells us so) and yet we m=\r\nay feel elated. When someone puts us &lt;br&gt;\ndown, we may know that it is irre=\r\nlevant (our inner voice tells us so) &lt;br&gt;\nand yet we may feel offended and =\r\nfeel like doing something about it. All &lt;br&gt;\nthis comes from conditioning, =\r\nwhich has been accumulated over many &lt;br&gt;\nlives.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIdnetifying the c=\r\nonditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, &lt;br&gt;\ncalculations and a=\r\nctions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key &lt;br&gt;\nis to learn to =\r\nlisten to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the &lt;br&gt;\ninner voice of c=\r\nonscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled &lt;br&gt;\nfrom inside to d=\r\no otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning. We=\r\n often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey &lt;br&gt;\nthe inner voice=\r\n of our conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller a=\r\nctions - physical or mental &lt;br&gt;\n- that go against the inner voice of consc=\r\nience, it means our &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only=\r\n meaningful measure of &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress. This may in general be diff=\r\nicult for others to &lt;br&gt;\njudge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe tricky thing is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\ncontrolled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action again=\r\nst &lt;br&gt;\nmy inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just happened and wh=\r\nether &lt;br&gt;\nI violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole process is g=\r\noverned &lt;br&gt;\nby the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am conditio=\r\nned to &lt;br&gt;\nthink that I am a good person doing the right thing and not mak=\r\ning a &lt;br&gt;\nmistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of co=\r\nnscience &lt;br&gt;\nas a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Ins=\r\ntead, it &lt;br&gt;\nwill focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts o=\r\nut from &lt;br&gt;\ninside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that=\r\n I did the &lt;br&gt;\nright thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe grip of conditioning is too tight=\r\n to overcome in a day or two! But, &lt;br&gt;\nthe inner voice of conscience does =\r\ntell everyone when one is doing &lt;br&gt;\nsomething wrong under the influence of=\r\n conditioning. If one keeps &lt;br&gt;\ntrying, it can oneday help one identify an=\r\nd overcome conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSPECIAL EXPE=\r\nRIENCES&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have s=\r\nuper-normal or &lt;br&gt;\nmystical or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor example, one person I know started to feel very light in the=\r\n head &lt;br&gt;\nwith a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he med=\r\nitated &lt;br&gt;\nwith a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a bi=\r\ng fire at &lt;br&gt;\nthe base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire =\r\n(he actually &lt;br&gt;\nfelt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific m=\r\nantra. Another &lt;br&gt;\nperson saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity=\r\n talked to him. &lt;br&gt;\nInterestingly, the same deity was seen by another pers=\r\non who was also &lt;br&gt;\nsitting there at the same time and that person had a t=\r\notally different &lt;br&gt;\n(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same =\r\ndeity at the same &lt;br&gt;\ntime. Another person felt like he became very light =\r\nand was floating in &lt;br&gt;\nair and there was an inexpressible happiness. In a=\r\nnother case, one &lt;br&gt;\nsadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense tha=\r\nt his job was done &lt;br&gt;\non earth and he could now leave. He thought, &quot;let m=\r\ne leave and let me &lt;br&gt;\ntake some more with me&quot;. He felt like he was a poin=\r\nt moving up with a &lt;br&gt;\ntremendous speed. At the same time, another person =\r\nwho was meditating a &lt;br&gt;\nfew feet away in front of a homam fire felt like =\r\nsomebody was pulling &lt;br&gt;\nthat person forcibly through a cave and felt real=\r\nly overwhelmed.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere are so many possible experiences. But the ke=\r\ny point is that &lt;br&gt;\nexperiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY =\r\nNOR SUFFICIENT for &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, =\r\nprogress and setbacks &lt;br&gt;\nand I am 100% sure of the above. You&#39;ll do well =\r\nto remember this &lt;br&gt;\nsentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences =\r\nor desire them &lt;br&gt;\nconsciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little=\r\n later on the &lt;br&gt;\ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*       =\r\n *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe say t=\r\nhat god can be known only by experience and not by reading &lt;br&gt;\nbooks. That=\r\n is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous of an &lt;br&gt;\nexperien=\r\nce, one may experience an aspect of god&#39;s Delusory Power instead &lt;br&gt;\nof go=\r\nd and that may increase false pride (a true experience of god will &lt;br&gt;\nins=\r\ntead produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTh=\r\nere is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ntheory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nexperience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\ntheory may actually be better if it actually reduces one&#39;s ego to a &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\npound or an ounce!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe issue is not whether one needs practical ex=\r\nperience or theoretical &lt;br&gt;\nunderstanding. That is secondary. The primary =\r\nthing is what is happening &lt;br&gt;\nto one&#39;s ego. Is it getting inflated or def=\r\nlated? THAT is undoubtedly &lt;br&gt;\nthe main issue. If reading books, satsanga,=\r\n rituals, theoretical &lt;br&gt;\nunderstanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a qui=\r\nntal, from a quintal to &lt;br&gt;\na pound and from a pound to an ounce, even wit=\r\nhout a direct experience, &lt;br&gt;\nthat&#39;s awesome. That is better than getting =\r\na ton of experience and ego &lt;br&gt;\nbeing inflated from a pound to a quintal.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThough it is true that ego does not become complete zero without a=\r\nn &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;experience&quot; of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce =\r\nit &lt;br&gt;\nto as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come=\r\n by &lt;br&gt;\nitself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is a=\r\n nice line: &quot;Don&#39;t &lt;br&gt;\nchase success, but chase capability. Success will f=\r\nollow automatically.&quot; &lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase de=\r\ntachment and deflation &lt;br&gt;\nof ego. Experience will automatically follow. C=\r\nhasing experience without &lt;br&gt;\ntrying to reduce ego is like putting the car=\r\nt before the horse. To use &lt;br&gt;\nthe analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one =\r\nthen runs the risk of &lt;br&gt;\nbecoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Rama=\r\nlingam (alias Silencer) &lt;br&gt;\nof that movie, who chased success, ended up wi=\r\nth huge ego from limited &lt;br&gt;\nsuccess and failed in the end!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*    =\r\n    *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs said above,=\r\n it is a bad idea to seek an &quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego &lt;br&gt;\nis still a to=\r\nn or a quintal. In other words, when one&#39;s conditioning is &lt;br&gt;\ndense enoug=\r\nh, a pre-occupation with experiences can be &lt;br&gt;\ncounter-productive. The re=\r\nason is that any experience will be &lt;br&gt;\ninterpreted (and absorbed into one=\r\n&#39;s system!!!) through the color of &lt;br&gt;\none&#39;s conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf I g=\r\no into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see &lt;br&gt;\nthat S=\r\nun is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass &lt;br&gt;\nwindows =\r\nof a house. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through &lt;br&gt;\ngreen e=\r\nyeglasses. In either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am &lt;br&gt;\nexperien=\r\ncing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun &lt;br&gt;\nis gre=\r\nen&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing S=\r\nun!) CAN &lt;br&gt;\ngenerate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one&#39;s condit=\r\nioning is &lt;br&gt;\nconducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe key is not =\r\njust to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* &lt;br&gt;\nand absorb t=\r\nhe experience into one&#39;s system well. One&#39;s conditioning &lt;br&gt;\ninfluences ho=\r\nw one digests various life experiences, including spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nexperience=\r\ns and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the &lt;br&gt;\nabove ex=\r\nample!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nIn ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nbuildup in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\ntissues and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look a=\r\nnd &lt;br&gt;\nfeel healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, =\r\none &lt;br&gt;\ndevelops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various=\r\n parts &lt;br&gt;\nof the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of g=\r\nood food &lt;br&gt;\nbeing taken in and the working of even medicines one may take=\r\n in. When &lt;br&gt;\ntoo much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, on=\r\ne may need &lt;br&gt;\nto go through a painful de-toxification process.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nS=\r\nimilarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly build up, get &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nabsorbed into various aspects of one&#39;s being and create various diseases=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nin the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel &lt;br&gt;\nsp=\r\niritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nam=\r\na accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can &lt;br&gt;\neve=\r\nntually affect one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for &lt;br&gt;\nde-=\r\ntoxification) may be far more difficult than the physical &lt;br&gt;\npancha-karma=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nT=\r\no illustrate what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n*hypothetical* example.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSuppose someone sits still for a few hour=\r\ns everyday and meditates. &lt;br&gt;\nSuppose one starts to get some special inner=\r\n experiences and some &lt;br&gt;\nseemingly supernatural things start happening ex=\r\nternally around one. &lt;br&gt;\nSuppose these experiences give one the impression=\r\n that one is special &lt;br&gt;\nand one is making excellent spiritual progress. S=\r\nuppose one reads some &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual books and fantasizes &quot;becoming like Sh=\r\niva&quot; mentioned in those &lt;br&gt;\nbooks. Then one may start to think &quot;may be, I =\r\nhave become like Shiva&quot; &lt;br&gt;\nand slowly convince oneself that one HAS becom=\r\ne like Shiva. Suppose one &lt;br&gt;\nreads a spiritual book that claims &quot;If one b=\r\necomes like Shiva, the whole &lt;br&gt;\nuniverse connives against one who causes =\r\nan offense to him&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOf course, there is a context behind every sta=\r\ntement and no statement is &lt;br&gt;\nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, one ma=\r\ny digest and absorb it into &lt;br&gt;\none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one c=\r\nould have also said, &quot;if one &lt;br&gt;\nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fu=\r\nlly co-operates with one and &lt;br&gt;\nthere is no way anyone can really cause o=\r\nffense to that person&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnyway, one in the process of convincing o=\r\nneself that one has indeed &lt;br&gt;\nbecome like Shiva may then look for example=\r\ns of someone causing offense &lt;br&gt;\nand suffering bad things. Of course, just=\r\n as one can find any shapes in &lt;br&gt;\nclouds, one can find any correlations i=\r\nn things happening around one. &lt;br&gt;\nOne will find a few examples. That may =\r\nreinforce the delusion that one &lt;br&gt;\nhas become like Shiva. When good and b=\r\nad happen to people around one, &lt;br&gt;\none may start correlating them to good=\r\n and bad done by those people to &lt;br&gt;\none and/or to things one has done. Ov=\r\ner time, the delusion may become so &lt;br&gt;\ndeep that it just feels so natural=\r\n and obvious. This is like a serious &lt;br&gt;\ndisease developing from a toxic b=\r\nuildup of undigested or badly digested &lt;br&gt;\nfood. Inability to fully unders=\r\ntand the spiritual experiences one had, &lt;br&gt;\nthe fantasy of becoming like S=\r\nhiva, the pre-exising pride (like &lt;br&gt;\npre-existing ama) and the not-so-wel=\r\nl-digested notion that offense to &lt;br&gt;\nShiva causes harm, have together cre=\r\nated spiritual ama buildup that now &lt;br&gt;\nresulted in a serious disease.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nThough original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nlater on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from th=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\nill-digested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nconducive to creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nthe system can spread to others.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs said before, the key iss=\r\nue is: Is the ego getting inflated or &lt;br&gt;\ndeflated. If ego is getting infl=\r\nated, then one is on the wrong track. &lt;br&gt;\nOne is either deluding oneself o=\r\nr ill-digesting genuine experiences due &lt;br&gt;\nto pre-existing conditioning a=\r\nnd delusions (spiritual ama). In either &lt;br&gt;\ncase, whatever one is experien=\r\ncing is not being digested well and is &lt;br&gt;\nweakening the system instead of=\r\n strengthening it. If, on the other hand, &lt;br&gt;\nego is getting deflated, the=\r\nn one is on the right track. Whatever one is &lt;br&gt;\nexperiencing is being dig=\r\nested well and strengthening the system.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nSHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis emphasis on ego deflation ma=\r\ny make some people wonder about the &lt;br&gt;\nprominence given in some books to =\r\naccumulation of shakti, siddhis and &lt;br&gt;\nmiracles. For example, some books =\r\ndescribe what a being like Shiva or &lt;br&gt;\nsomeone less but still with high e=\r\nnough shakti, can do.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings =\r\nclose to enlightenment MAY &lt;br&gt;\nhave a lot of spiritual shakti and be able =\r\nto do some special things. &lt;br&gt;\nBut, no book said that you get those abilit=\r\nies by being proud or &lt;br&gt;\npursuing something that can make one proud.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nthem from one&#39;s *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite a=\r\nkin &lt;br&gt;\nto looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from green eyeglasses and admiring the=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\ngreenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole poi=\r\nnt. &lt;br&gt;\nOne with dense conditioning can&#39;t even understand what that shakti=\r\n or &lt;br&gt;\nability really means or comes from. In order to understand what sh=\r\nakti &lt;br&gt;\nis, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUS=\r\nT &lt;br&gt;\ndeflate one&#39;s ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBottomline is this: Most scriptures of m=\r\nost religions are unanimous in &lt;br&gt;\nteaching the importance of humility, co=\r\nmpassion and ego deflation. No &lt;br&gt;\nscripture talks about the glory of prid=\r\ne and ego inflation. It&#39;s as &lt;br&gt;\nsimple as that.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *      =\r\n  *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS &amp; CONVERSATIONS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe encou=\r\nnter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses &lt;br&gt;\nand a=\r\nlso conversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime &lt;br&gt;\ncom=\r\ning from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine &lt;br&gt;\nbe=\r\nings supposedly said is well within what one consciously or &lt;br&gt;\nsub-consci=\r\nously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis may remi=\r\nnd one of the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character &lt;br&gt;\nplayed by =\r\nSanjay Dutt in hit bollywood movie &quot;Lage Rahe Munnabhai&quot;. In &lt;br&gt;\nthat movi=\r\ne, the visions are due to &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in Munnabhai&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nmind and=\r\n the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions &lt;br&gt;\nthat Munn=\r\nabhai himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So &lt;br&gt;\nthe conc=\r\nlusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a &lt;br&gt;\ncharacter in =\r\nhis own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai &lt;br&gt;\nunderstands of Gandhi=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different f=\r\nrom this &lt;br&gt;\nmovie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting bas=\r\ned on all &lt;br&gt;\nthat one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it=\r\n may be a &lt;br&gt;\nreal being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her a=\r\nctions are &lt;br&gt;\ninterpreted strictly based on one&#39;s conditioning, like the =\r\n&quot;green Sun&quot; &lt;br&gt;\nin our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, wha=\r\nt divine &lt;br&gt;\nbeings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consci=\r\nously or &lt;br&gt;\nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning havi=\r\nng a &lt;br&gt;\nreal divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mothe=\r\nr or &lt;br&gt;\nfather, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understand=\r\ning and &lt;br&gt;\nwisdom.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAgain, the key is not to see a god or a godde=\r\nss, but to be &lt;br&gt;\nde-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKUNDALINI AWAKENING &amp; RISE&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne =\r\nmore thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. &lt;br&gt;\nKu=\r\nndalini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this &lt;br&gt;\ni=\r\ns &quot;I&quot;). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\neven question who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nself down to the physical body and physical senses. However, &lt;br&gt;\nself-=\r\nawareness rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nprogre=\r\nss or enlightenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of &lt;br&gt;\na lo=\r\nng process. If one&#39;s conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle &lt;br&gt;\nide=\r\nas of who one is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the &lt;br&gt;\nworld=\r\n many times in the past and came back to save it), an awakened &lt;br&gt;\nKundali=\r\nni may take one&#39;s notion of self beyond the physical body, but &lt;br&gt;\nwill ge=\r\nt stuck somewhere else. In fact, one&#39;s subtle notions of self may &lt;br&gt;\nbeco=\r\nme aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may &lt;br&gt;\nex=\r\nperience things that aggravate and strengthen those notions. One may &lt;br&gt;\ng=\r\net badly stuck.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs mentioned above, any spiritual experience can c=\r\nreate spiritual ama &lt;br&gt;\nwhen not digested properly. Any pre-existing condi=\r\ntioning may make it &lt;br&gt;\ndifficult to digest anything complex. Instead of e=\r\nating a heavy-duty &lt;br&gt;\nprotein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxi=\r\nc buildup in the &lt;br&gt;\nsystem, one is better off eating simple food that one=\r\n&#39;s own system can &lt;br&gt;\nprocess and digest well.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo be clear, wheth=\r\ner one&#39;s Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nKundalini is cu=\r\nrrently, is NOT a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress. As &lt;br&gt;\nKundalini do=\r\nes not rise through a single path, as the rise is not linear &lt;br&gt;\nand as th=\r\ne obstructions are not uniform in all people, one cannot &lt;br&gt;\ncompare two p=\r\neople based on Kundalini experiences.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne can cling to the body an=\r\nd overcome all conditioning slowly and &lt;br&gt;\noneday Kundalini may awaken and=\r\n rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another &lt;br&gt;\nperson may awaken Kundalini an=\r\nd it may get stuck somewhere where it is &lt;br&gt;\nextremely difficult to overco=\r\nme the corresponding conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe bottomline is that how much=\r\n conditioning is overcome and how reduced &lt;br&gt;\none&#39;s ego is is the correct =\r\nmeasure of spiritual progress and not &lt;br&gt;\nwhether Kundalini is awakened an=\r\nd where Kundalini is.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCORRELATIONS GA=\r\nLORE&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDo not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that m=\r\nay or may &lt;br&gt;\nnot mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, &quot;=\r\nwow, I was &lt;br&gt;\njust thinking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something and =\r\nsomeone says, &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as t=\r\nhough you read &lt;br&gt;\nmy mind.&quot; Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings =\r\nin some region of &lt;br&gt;\nthe world, did a special sadhana and suppose somethi=\r\nng bad happened &lt;br&gt;\nthere. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your=\r\n mind, did some &lt;br&gt;\nsadhana and the desire was fulfilled.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn seve=\r\nral such cases, correlating a result with something you did can &lt;br&gt;\noften =\r\nincrease pride and your sense of self-worth. And, doing that will &lt;br&gt;\nnot =\r\nenable you to do your dharma any better.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKeep thinking your though=\r\nts and desires, keep doing your actions and &lt;br&gt;\nkeep doing your sadhana. T=\r\nhat&#39;s it. Don&#39;t correlate actions and results &lt;br&gt;\nand think that you made =\r\nX or Y result happen. We engage in actions and &lt;br&gt;\ngod gives results. The =\r\nsense of &quot;I made X happen&quot; is conducive to pride &lt;br&gt;\nand ego inflation. Mo=\r\nreover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether &lt;br&gt;\naction A or B caused r=\r\nesult X or Y, because the action-result pipeline &lt;br&gt;\nhas variable delay!! =\r\nSo, why even bother to correlate and run the risk &lt;br&gt;\nof ego inflation?&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBOTTOMLINE&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDon&#39;t run after spe=\r\ncial experiences and special abilities or anything &lt;br&gt;\nthat makes you spec=\r\nial (as you imagine currently, based on your dense &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning). Spir=\r\nitual progress is not about becoming &quot;special&quot;, but &lt;br&gt;\nabout becoming hum=\r\nble. Special experiences and abilities do not matter &lt;br&gt;\nat all. In fact, =\r\nthey can distract one and give false pride. God makes &lt;br&gt;\none special AFTE=\r\nR one sheds pride completely or almost completely.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlso, stop corr=\r\nelating things happening to or around you, with your &lt;br&gt;\nactions, and thin=\r\nk that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is &lt;br&gt;\nyour sacred du=\r\nty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time is &lt;br&gt;\ngod&#39;s prerog=\r\native. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe &lt;br&gt;\nin one&#39;s t=\r\nhinking.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRemember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful mea=\r\nsure of &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble =\r\nyou become &lt;br&gt;\n(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have =\r\nreally become &lt;br&gt;\ninternally). It is how well you are able to resist the t=\r\nemptations of &lt;br&gt;\nfollowing the voice of your conditioning (which inflates=\r\n ego) and how &lt;br&gt;\nwell you can follow the voice of conscience.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWh=\r\nen inflations in ego occur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice &lt;br&gt;\ni=\r\nt, bring it to the attention and perhaps even be ruthless in belling &lt;br&gt;\nt=\r\nhe cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that well. So, &lt;br&gt;\ny=\r\nou have to do your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUnfor=\r\ntunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS &lt;br&gt;\nvery =\r\nvery very likely for most of us to include many many many &lt;br&gt;\nopportunitie=\r\ns for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict &lt;br&gt;\nwatch on =\r\nyour ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf I offended anybody with =\r\nsome strong assertions in this email, my &lt;br&gt;\napologies.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOm Tat Sa=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKrishnarapanamstu,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n--------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitter ID: @ho=\r\nmam108&lt;br&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--798208272-590979030-1330495199=:54013--\r\n\n"}}
