Why and how such people get big platforms for th=\r\neir rubbish? one thing for sure is that their work must not get entry in to=\r\n University/schools. \nAditiji - I thank you and your team of editors and ot=\r\nhers for the effort. Would you please write me personally so that i can get=\r\n the book asap in Dubai.\n\nWarm Regards and wish you a very Happy Navaratris=\r\n!\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjee=\r\na@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m one of the co-editors of the book. Thanks for the mes=\r\nsages of support.\n&gt; There is a lot of work to be done in this area. For exa=\r\nmple, Wendy Doniger,\n&gt; who is the culprit behind a lot of negative misportr=\r\nayals of Hindus and\n&gt; Hinduism (as described in the book) recently wrote a =\r\nhistory of Hinduism\n&gt; book (though she admits she is not a historian) that =\r\nshe is aiming to have\n&gt; be used as a standard textbook in Indian schools in=\r\n the high school levels\n&gt; (as stated in the introduction to the book). Ther=\r\ne have been some articles\n&gt; and other reports written critiquing the book--=\r\nfor example, I wrote an\n&gt; article in Outlook India refuting her claim that =\r\nRama threw out Sita because\n&gt; he was afraid of becoming a sex addict like h=\r\nis father, Dasaratha, etc.--but\n&gt; there needs to be more of a coordinated m=\r\novement not only to refute such\n&gt; writings but to produce scholarly and obj=\r\nective descriptions of Hinduism\n&gt; that can replace the more bigoted / denig=\r\nratory writings.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not really into politics, but I can tell you fro=\r\nm having been born and\n&gt; raised in America, that the school envirionment (i=\r\nncluding at the very\n&gt; liberal schools I attended) is poisoned for learning=\r\n about Hinduism. The\n&gt; most frustrating thing for me as a young girl wantin=\r\ng to learn about\n&gt; Hinduism was the lack of resources--I would go to the Hi=\r\nnduism shelf at the\n&gt; library or bookstore only to find exposes on the &quot;cul=\r\nt of the Hare Krishnas&quot;\n&gt; or trashy books on Tantric sex, or go read textbo=\r\noks or other scholarly\n&gt; books on Hinduism at school only to be inundated w=\r\nith denouncements of caste\n&gt; and mockeries of the Hindu pantheon as, at bes=\r\nt, amusing mythology or, at\n&gt; worst, as a mythology that reflected certain =\r\ndisturbing pathologies of the\n&gt; Indic people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Had I not the great fort=\r\nune of finding my guru and other true acharyas who\n&gt; were able to provide m=\r\ne a correct understanding of Hinduism, I may have\n&gt; eventually given up my =\r\nsearch and lost out not only on knowing my heritage\n&gt; but on finding the pa=\r\nth of sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is for this reason that I think this work is so impo=\r\nrtant and urgent.\n&gt; \n&gt; More information on these issues in general is avail=\r\nable at\n&gt; www.invadingthesacred.com. I also have many extra copies of the b=\r\nook. If you\n&gt; or someone you know would be interested, please let me know a=\r\nnd I can\n&gt; arrange to have copies shipped. We are trying to provide copies =\r\nto temples\n&gt; and local libraries so that it is there as a resource for thos=\r\ne who are\n&gt; interested.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm regards,\n&gt; Aditi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Oct 1=\r\n1, 2010 at 4:49 AM, Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  iam wond=\r\nering how to give encouragement to the pioneers who are doing\n&gt; &gt; this impo=\r\nrtant scholarly rebuttal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; *From=\r\n:* Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; *=\r\nSent:* Mon, October 11, 2010 8:37:26 AM\n&gt; &gt; *Subject:* [vedic-wisdom] &quot;Inva=\r\nding the Sacred&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A member of this =\r\ngroup gifted me a book when he met me for a saamoohika\n&gt; &gt; Satya Narayana v=\r\nratam we conducted at Cary, North Carolina last year. I\n&gt; &gt; finally got to =\r\nread a little from it. I am impressed with this work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The book is c=\r\nalled &quot;Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in\n&gt; &gt; America&quot;=\r\n (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi\n&gt; &gt; Banerjee). =\r\nIt has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perverted sch=\r\nolars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upon\n&gt; &gt; India and H=\r\ninduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted\n&gt; &gt; researches i=\r\nn the name of academic freedom at the religious studies\n&gt; &gt; departments of =\r\nwestern universities, published them and gained name and\n&gt; &gt; fame, tramplin=\r\ng the sacred in the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated\n&gt; &gt; with thi=\r\ns will not improve the situation or solve the problem. Interested\n&gt; &gt; relig=\r\nious scholars have to firmly and patiently crtique these works in the\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\name academic style, in order to reclaim the rightful place for Hinduism.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Several papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works=\r\n by\n&gt; &gt; western scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fa=\r\nllacious,\n&gt; &gt; hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or fil=\r\nled with lies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will just give an example of the off=\r\nensive work that was rebutted in this\n&gt; &gt; book. [Warning: Those who are sen=\r\nsitive to offensive writings should skip\n&gt; &gt; the next three paragraphs.]\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in We=\r\nst\n&gt; &gt; Bengal and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people t=\r\nhere\n&gt; &gt; enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, what he=\r\n produced\n&gt; &gt; is utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his=\r\n PhD\n&gt; &gt; dissertation without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to c=\r\nheck for\n&gt; &gt; factual or linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people=\r\n found out\n&gt; &gt; about what he produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kal=\r\ni&#39;s Child&quot; based\n&gt; &gt; on the PhD dissertation won great acclaim in the West.=\r\n He won an award at\n&gt; &gt; the Americal Academy of Religion for that book, lan=\r\nded a job at Harvard and\n&gt; &gt; his book was sadly mentioned in the Encycloped=\r\nia Britannica as the *number\n&gt; &gt; one* choice for learning about Ramakrishna=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted per=\r\nson, a\n&gt; &gt; homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or =\r\nSanskrit\n&gt; &gt; well and did not take help from any Bengali people at the Miss=\r\nion for this\n&gt; &gt; work. He used his own faulty translations, willful distort=\r\nions and\n&gt; &gt; manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (and damning)=\r\n conclusions.\n&gt; &gt; For example, he translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;ge=\r\nnitals&quot;, in the\n&gt; &gt; context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakris=\r\nhna and a young boy\n&gt; &gt; then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a=\r\n word that means\n&gt; &gt; &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpas=\r\nte on the penises of\n&gt; &gt; boys&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even in places where there was no m=\r\naterial to mis-translate, he simply\n&gt; &gt; speculated! For example, he specula=\r\nted on the meeting of Totapuri and\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadh=\r\nu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught\n&gt; &gt; advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and ma=\r\nde him go beyond Mother Kali and\n&gt; &gt; experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What i=\r\nt must have been like for Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; a homosexually oriented man, to =\r\nbe shut away for days in a small hut with\n&gt; &gt; another, stark-naked man. Ved=\r\nanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; nudity, and more especially,=\r\n his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; attention. How could it =\r\nnot?&quot; Please note that he is not referring to any\n&gt; &gt; source and mis-transl=\r\nating it, but simply speculating based on his perverted\n&gt; &gt; agenda!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you see the book, you will see many examples of such pseu=\r\ndo-scholarship\n&gt; &gt; driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many perver=\r\nted people under\n&gt; &gt; asuric influences make their livelihood, money and fam=\r\ne lying and spreading\n&gt; &gt; falsehoods about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hind=\r\nu saints.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Those who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha again=\r\nst this may ignore\n&gt; &gt; this and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if en=\r\nough people do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; to strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of thin=\r\ngs will automatically\n&gt; &gt; weaken. However, some scholars engaging these pse=\r\nudo-scholars academically\n&gt; &gt; is really required on the ground. We need to =\r\ngive our encouragement to the\n&gt; &gt; pioneers who are doing this important sch=\r\nolarly rebuttal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http=\r\n://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
