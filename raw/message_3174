If one ha=\r\ns a deep attachment \n&gt;to the body, mind may be attached to the body even af=\r\nter death, even after \n&gt;the connection of the karmendriyas and jnanendriyas=\r\n of the mind to the \n&gt;physical body is cut off. Then what happens to the bo=\r\ndy does affect the mind \n&gt;and its further\n&gt; progress.\n&gt;\n&gt;*        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;\n&gt;When one takes sannyasa, i.e renounces material world, the last rites =\r\nare to \n&gt;be done symbolically. After that, one is dead symbolically. Howeve=\r\nr, if one \n&gt;does not have true renunciation and detachment from body, relat=\r\nives and \n&gt;other material objects, there is no point in taking sannyasa or =\r\ndoing \n&gt;symbolic last rites. Even if one does it, mind may still be attache=\r\nd to the \n&gt;body. If last rites are not done after death, even a sannyasi&#39;s =\r\nmind may \n&gt;have problems. On the other hand, a true sannyasi who is absolut=\r\nely detached \n&gt;from the body even when alive will fly high when mind is fin=\r\nally freed from \n&gt;the body at death.\n&gt;\n&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;One cannot c=\r\nontrol what others do with one&#39;s body after one leaves it. So \n&gt;the wisest =\r\ncourse of action would be to develop detachment even when alive.\n&gt; \n&gt;Divert=\r\n the concern for the well-being of the body towards other people. Do \n&gt;bare=\r\n minimum to keep the body alive and not be overly concerned about it. \n&gt;Whe=\r\nn you meditate, think only of god and try to forget that there is a body \n&gt;=\r\nthat you occupy. Even if leg hurts or neck itches, try to forget about it. =\r\n\n&gt;If you ignore body for a while, it will cry out for attention, like an \n&gt;=\r\nimmature child who needs attention. If you give it attention, you cannot \n&gt;=\r\nexperience god. But, as you ignore body more, body will try more to get you=\r\nr \n&gt;attention (like an immature child who needs attention)! However, if you=\r\n \n&gt;persist, body will have to eventually give up! THAT is when one can abso=\r\nrb \n&gt;the mind fully in god.\n&gt;\n&gt;If one experiences that often while alive, t=\r\nhat experience helps immensely \n&gt;at death. When the mind leaves the body fo=\r\nr the last time, one can focus \n&gt;mind on god and ignore the attention grabb=\r\ning cries for help from the\n&gt; body. \n&gt;One who successfully focuses mind on =\r\ngod when the last moment comes is \n&gt;liberated and gets saayujya or moksha. =\r\nOn the other hand, one who wavers \n&gt;from the focus on god and lets mind tur=\r\nn towards the plight of the dying \n&gt;body gets stuck.\n&gt;\n&gt;To a yogi, each ses=\r\nsion of deep meditation is like a dress rehearsal of the \n&gt;last moment! Dea=\r\nth is not to be feared. If faced correctly, it is the moment \n&gt;of final lib=\r\neration. Life is meant to be a practice for it!\n&gt;\n&gt;Instead of worrying abou=\r\nt body and its last rites, let every ritual be a \n&gt;last rite! I suggest tha=\r\nt one should practice detachment and develop the \n&gt;ability to absolutely ig=\r\nnore the pitiful cries of the body for attention as \n&gt;one tries to focus th=\r\ne mind on god and succeed in absorbing the mind in god \n&gt;when meditating. I=\r\nf one practices that, the issue of who does last rites and \n&gt;what rites bec=\r\nomes irrelevant.\n&gt;\n&gt;*        *   \n&gt;     *\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, one who performs br=\r\nilliantly in dress rehearsals may still forget \n&gt;one&#39;s lines or put a wrong=\r\n expression when playing the drama finally on the \n&gt;big stage. Similarly, a=\r\n yogi who has overcome the attachment to body and \n&gt;absorbed the mind perfe=\r\nctly in god many times may still waver at the last \n&gt;moment and think of bo=\r\ndy or something else that is impermenant and be \n&gt;reborn.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, all t=\r\nhat is in our control is to practice and prepare for the last \n&gt;moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n*        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;You are lucky. There are many Hindus who do not expe=\r\nrience anything like \n&gt;what you described. Keep doing sadhana and overcome =\r\nthe little rawness that \n&gt;may still be left in the consciousness.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -\n&gt;  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n\n&gt; Writings,\n&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n&gt;                  http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;     Films that m=\r\nake a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt;     Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;  Jyotish writings: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;\n&gt;------------\n&gt;\n&gt;|| Om Shaantih Shaantih =\r\nShaantih ||\n&gt;Yahoo!

So &lt;br&gt;the wisest course of action would be to develop detach=\r\nment even when alive.\n &lt;br&gt;Divert the concern for the well-being of the bod=\r\ny towards other people. Do &lt;br&gt;bare minimum to keep the body alive and not =\r\nbe overly concerned about it. &lt;br&gt;When you meditate, think only of god and =\r\ntry to forget that there is a body &lt;br&gt;that you occupy. Even if leg hurts o=\r\nr neck itches, try to forget about it. &lt;br&gt;If you ignore body for a while, =\r\nit will cry out for attention, like an &lt;br&gt;immature child who needs attenti=\r\non. If you give it attention, you cannot &lt;br&gt;experience god. But, as you ig=\r\nnore body more, body will try more to get your &lt;br&gt;attention (like an immat=\r\nure child who needs attention)! However, if you &lt;br&gt;persist, body will have=\r\n to eventually give up! THAT is when one can absorb &lt;br&gt;the mind fully in g=\r\nod.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one experiences that often while alive, that experience helps=\r\n immensely &lt;br&gt;at death. When the mind leaves the body for the last time, o=\r\nne can focus &lt;br&gt;mind on god and ignore the attention grabbing cries for he=\r\nlp from the\n body. &lt;br&gt;One who successfully focuses mind on god when the la=\r\nst moment comes is &lt;br&gt;liberated and gets saayujya or moksha. On the other =\r\nhand, one who wavers &lt;br&gt;from the focus on god and lets mind turn towards t=\r\nhe plight of the dying &lt;br&gt;body gets stuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a yogi, each session =\r\nof deep meditation is like a dress rehearsal of the &lt;br&gt;last moment! Death =\r\nis not to be feared. If faced correctly, it is the moment &lt;br&gt;of final libe=\r\nration. Life is meant to be a practice for it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of worrying a=\r\nbout body and its last rites, let every ritual be a &lt;br&gt;last rite! I sugges=\r\nt that one should practice detachment and develop the &lt;br&gt;ability to absolu=\r\ntely ignore the pitiful cries of the body for attention as &lt;br&gt;one tries to=\r\n focus the mind on god and succeed in absorbing the mind in god &lt;br&gt;when me=\r\nditating. If one practices that, the issue of who does last rites and &lt;br&gt;w=\r\nhat rites becomes irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &=\r\nnbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, one who performs brilliantly in dr=\r\ness rehearsals may still forget &lt;br&gt;one&#39;s lines or put a wrong expression w=\r\nhen playing the drama finally on the &lt;br&gt;big stage. Similarly, a yogi who h=\r\nas overcome the attachment to body and &lt;br&gt;absorbed the mind perfectly in g=\r\nod many times may still waver at the last &lt;br&gt;moment and think of body or s=\r\nomething else that is impermenant and be &lt;br&gt;reborn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, all th=\r\nat is in our control is to practice and prepare for the last &lt;br&gt;moment.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You=\r\n are lucky. There are many Hindus who do not experience anything like &lt;br&gt;w=\r\nhat you described. Keep doing sadhana and overcome the little rawness that =\r\n&lt;br&gt;may still be left in the consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasim=\r\nha&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish\n Writi=\r\nngs,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Films that make a=\r\n difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiri=\r\ntuality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/JyotishWri tings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;|| Om Shaantih Shaanti=\r\nh Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
