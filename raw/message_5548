I can remember he drove up in a huge car that had no number =\r\nplate but a big &quot;sha~gku&quot; - We kids were supposed to take off our shits - a=\r\nnd receive his blessings. There were two queues - one for girls most of the=\r\nm wearing bright new silk &quot;paTTu&quot; dresses. One of the sha~gkarAcarya&#39;s goon=\r\ns come up and asked one little Punjabi girl that was our neighbour age abou=\r\nt about 10 or 11 that was wearing shalwar kameez to go out of the line. And=\r\n the poor girl was in tears.

A couple of years later I made peace with Adi sha~gkarAcArya on a trip to=\r\n Kedarnath with my Gujarati class mate from a business family and My father=\r\n - The three of us walked about 45 miles up and down stopiing at different =\r\n&quot;chaTTis&quot; and cooking our own. On reaching kedarnath, I told him about the =\r\nincident of the punjabi dress. He in his typical tone said - &quot;dandho ni bAt=\r\n ce .. we have come so far .... anybody that has re built a shiva temple an=\r\nd that too bearing your name cannot be all that bad&quot; We both had a laugh.

He rel=\r\nated the following incident that took place between\n&gt; &gt; his co-student (sch=\r\nolar-1) and his teacher (scholar-2) who is a great\n&gt; &gt; pandita.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sch=\r\nolar-1 -- There are so many Panditas these days, but people keep\n&gt; &gt; talkin=\r\ng about the scholarship of some particular Pandit (scholar-3).\n&gt; &gt; Is there=\r\n really such a vast difference?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; scholar-2 -- It is difficult to see=\r\n the difference, unless you\n&gt; &gt; yourself have deep scholarship. Let me desc=\r\nribe this by way of\n&gt; &gt; example. Though you yourself are well-qualified, yo=\r\nu see the\n&gt; &gt; difference between us. It is like you are seated at the base =\r\nof the\n&gt; &gt; himalayas, and I am seated at the top. Well, with this Pandita\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (scholar-3), I feel the same way. I am seated at the base of the\n&gt; &gt; him=\r\nalayas, and he is seated on top. But, for the average person, or\n&gt; &gt; even a=\r\n mere scholar, it is almost impossible to tell the difference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ther=\r\ne are many learned people who have access to a wide range of books\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nmaterials. They concentrate on breadth, and are limited to\n&gt; &gt; scratching t=\r\nhe surface. A true scholar on the other hand, looks for\n&gt; &gt; depth. It isn&#39;t=\r\n just the sheer amount of material that they have\n&gt; &gt; studied -- they have =\r\ninternalized the material to such an extent that\n&gt; &gt; they speak it with eve=\r\nry breath. Their way of thinking changes, and\n&gt; &gt; their speech is pramANam.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1046205136-1293681785=:91262\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;This is not a forum for mentally derange=\r\nd&nbsp;persons (like smartxpark)&nbsp;to write all&nbsp;sorts of nonsense h=\r\nere&nbsp;as well.

He =\r\nrelated the following incident that took place between&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; his co-=\r\nstudent (scholar-1) and his teacher (scholar-2) who is a great&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n pandita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; scholar-1 -- There are so many Panditas=\r\n these days, but people keep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; talking about the scholarship of =\r\nsome particular Pandit (scholar-3).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Is there really such a vas=\r\nt difference?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; scholar-2 -- It is difficult to see=\r\n the difference, unless you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yourself have deep scholarship. Le=\r\nt me describe this by way of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; example. Though you yourself are\n=\r\n well-qualified, you see the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; difference between us. It is like=\r\n you are seated at the base of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; himalayas, and I am seated =\r\nat the top. Well, with this Pandita&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (scholar-3), I feel the sa=\r\nme way. I am seated at the base of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; himalayas, and he is se=\r\nated on top. But, for the average person, or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even a mere schol=\r\nar, it is almost impossible to tell the difference.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; There are many learned people who have access to a wide range of books&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; and materials. They concentrate on breadth, and are limited to&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; scratching the surface. A true scholar on the other hand, look=\r\ns for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; depth. It isn&#39;t just the sheer amount of material that t=\r\nhey have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; studied -- they have internalized the material to suc=\r\nh an extent that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; they speak it with every breath. Their way of=\r\n thinking changes, and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their speech is\n pramANam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;ajit&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-1046205136-1293681785=:91262--\r\n\n"}}
