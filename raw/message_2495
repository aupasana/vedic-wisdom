Will you allo=\r\nw someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why=A0 not allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?\n=\r\n \nIt is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *well*. A purified se=\r\nrvant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion and has no ot=\r\nher thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person may think vario=\r\nus things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-centeredness an=\r\nd ego even in serving god.\n \nThe god in your homam fire is not an external =\r\ngod, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecti=\r\nng the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ab=\r\nility to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Thou=\r\ngh there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with=\r\n so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can fo=\r\ncus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. =\r\nFire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On practice, the d=\r\nivinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus=\r\n, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside =\r\nyou that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity s=\r\nhould be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnec=\r\nessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desi=\r\nres and other thoughts\n will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly=\r\n focus on that divinity.. Some precautions will help you in the journey.\n \n=\r\nKarmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in your homam fire a=\r\nre basically being received in your internal god. If he has enough power (h=\r\nis power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific=\r\n desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes him weaker and who kn=\r\nows whether the desire was worthwhile?!\n \nOf course, when you are offering =\r\nthings in fire, you yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may sl=\r\now down the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is =\r\nno escape. But, why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?\n \n=\r\nThus, this is not a matter of political correctness and being nice.\n \nHowev=\r\ner, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closel=\r\ny connected to one karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desi=\r\nres may affect husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desi=\r\nres already (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So th=\r\nere is no significant drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n \nBottomline=\r\n:\n \nIf some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas =\r\nand their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then=\r\n allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow sp=\r\necifically, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly =\r\naffecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!\n \nUsually=\r\n, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation better..\n \nBe=\r\nst regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=\r\nam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n \n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste=\r\n Shri Krishna Kanth,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immedia=\r\nte family.

Wha=\r\nt this namboodiri did is the correct way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Visualize the external f=\r\nire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle =\r\nyour internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identifi=\r\ncation is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that exte=\r\nrnal fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that p=\r\nerson to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can b=\r\ne allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and =\r\nwife or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from t=\r\nhe entire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, bu=\r\nt a person with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one fac=\r\nes and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may=\r\n be possible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all,=\r\n if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it wi=\r\nll die. If you guard it and let it grow\n very\n&gt; &gt;=A0 big, it can give flowe=\r\nrs and fruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep wor=\r\nking to burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental condit=\r\nioning) caused by them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same way a=\r\nn idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle =\r\nthe fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s=\r\n internal fire with external fire does such things, it can be disastrous. H=\r\nowever, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not understand muc=\r\nh about fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fir=\r\ne is practically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as=\r\n much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offe=\r\nrings into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. On=\r\nly you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own intern=\r\nal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a wh=\r\nile, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal f=\r\nire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) There are di=\r\nfferent methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara=\r\n nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worry about these things and do what y=\r\nou are used to or what you are more attracted to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I said many t=\r\nimes, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in=\r\n a particular body part has a higher significance than just tough a part an=\r\nd saying it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sou=\r\nnd is possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s =\r\nsubtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentially a=\r\n formality. I can tell you that this will not block you..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (3) They=\r\n should be shown in the video.

Wi=\r\nll you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why&nbsp; not allow him to=\r\n &quot;serve god&quot;?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *=\r\nwell*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and de=\r\nvotion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal pe=\r\nrson may think various things in mind even when serving god. There is some\n=\r\n self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The god in your hom=\r\nam fire is not an external god, but your own internal god. Through your men=\r\ntal focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you i=\r\nnto fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to c=\r\nlarify one thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside yo=\r\nu, your pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the div=\r\ninity that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it m=\r\nore and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing=\r\n better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and per=\r\nceive grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited m=\r\nanifestation of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and percei=\r\nve. This limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, ra=\r\nther than used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows\n and bec=\r\nomes infinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you will=\r\n be able to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions will h=\r\nelp you in the journey.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people who are makin=\r\ng offerings in your homam fire are basically being received in your interna=\r\nl god. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your =\r\nown* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But =\r\nthat makes him weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may have=\r\n some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, =\r\nthat is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;=\r\ns desires cause an extra slow down?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thus, this is not a matter of p=\r\nolitical correctness and being nice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;However, there is already a lo=\r\nt of karmic intermixing between people very closely\n connected to one karmi=\r\ncally, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s=\r\n desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast in =\r\na closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significant dr=\r\nawback to allowing them to share fire.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bottomline:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;If some =\r\npeople are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and their de=\r\nsires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such =\r\npeople to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specifically, =\r\nsome close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly affecting yo=\r\nur own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Usually, that=\r\n would be immediate family, but you know your situation better.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bes=\r\nt regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------&lt;br&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam&quot;\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer..org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannat=\r\nh.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:narayan.iyer@gma=\r\nil.com&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dnarayan.iyer@...&quot;&gt;narayan.iyer@gmail=\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste Shri\n Krishna Kanth,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nI am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family.

What this namboodiri did is the correct way.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire=\r\n and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and st=\r\nreamline it, depending on how strong your identification is (it will get st=\r\nronger with practice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offeri=\r\nngs in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fi=\r\nre for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whos=\r\ne karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and child=\r\nren. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you ar=\r\ne\n ready and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a strong=\r\n individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing t=\r\nhat ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on =\r\nmore karmas and face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking l=\r\neaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it =\r\nand let it grow very&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; big, it can give flowers and fruits=\r\n to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working to burn =\r\nyour karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) cause=\r\nd by them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same =\r\nway an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, ha=\r\nndle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies =\r\none&#39;s internal fire with external fire does such things, it can be disastro=\r\nus.. However, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not\n underst=\r\nand much about fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. =\r\nSo, fire is practically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from =\r\nfire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or maki=\r\nng offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at wor=\r\nst.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fir=\r\ne. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identif=\r\ny it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body=\r\n. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your =\r\nknowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakt=\r\ni and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do=\r\n not worry about these things and do what you are used to or what you are m=\r\nore attracted to.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said many\n times, these n=\r\nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a particular=\r\n body part has a higher significance than just tough a part and saying it. =\r\nVisualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is possibl=\r\ne only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle percep=\r\ntion. So there is no point in discussing what is essentially a formality. I=\r\n can tell you that this will not block you.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) =\r\nThey should be shown in the video. If you cannot get them, please feel free=\r\n to just say it and not show any mudra.

Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; hours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday.

Purusha sookta homam is the s=\r\nimplest homam &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and very useful for spiritual progres=\r\ns. I do have that in mind. Sudarsana &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam can also=\r\n be done on a regular basis quickly. But navagraha homam is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; more time-consuming. I will eventually put all of them up.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; r=\r\nologer.org/ homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups&lt;/a&gt;.\n yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro&lt;/a&gt;. home.comcast. net&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/a&gt; nath.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; From: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@ .&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &l=\r\nt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, =\r\nSeptember 01, 2009 6:10 AM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Q=\r\nuery related to Maha Ganapathi Homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n Namaskaram PVR Narasimha Raoji,&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am a big fan of the M=\r\naha Ganapathi Homam and I have seen it being &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nerformed at our home as a kid many times. I always wanted to perform this &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam on my own and after seeing your video and=\r\n the Laghu padhati document &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am sure I can do=\r\n it myself. I have couple of requests from my side:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is it possible to create a document for=\r\n the full fledged Ganapathi &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam ? This will =\r\nbe immensely helpful for people who have the time and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; intrest to perform such a homam.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) There are some other important homams particularly=\r\n the following in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which I am deeply intrested =\r\n:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n a) Sudarshana Homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; b) Navagraha Homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c) Purusha Suktha Homam&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would request you=\r\n to kindly create documents similar to the Maha &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Ganapathi Homam PDF so that the larger population is benefited.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Sharanam.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Sund=\r\naram&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;|| Om Shaan=\r\ntih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
