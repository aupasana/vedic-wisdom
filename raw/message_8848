Of these Abrahamic tendencies, Marxism is the only se=\r\nlf-stated atheistic one, the others being religious in nature. The greatest=\r\n real-world challenge and exact philosophical juxtaposition to the entire D=\r\nharmic worldview has historically been, and continues to this day to be, th=\r\ne Abrahamic mentality and worldview. \n\nWhile some very important theologica=\r\nl and ritual distinctions can be seen between them all, nonetheless the spe=\r\ncifically religious-oriented aspects of Abrahamism - Judaism, Christianity =\r\nand Islam - share a common worldview, psychological make-up, and guiding et=\r\nhos. Judaism, Christianity and Islam are historically referred to as the &quot;A=\r\nbrahamic&quot; religions because all three religions trace their origins to the =\r\nprophet Abraham, and can thus be seen to be quite similar in many aspects o=\r\nf their respective outlooks. The following are only a few of the similariti=\r\nes that they all share.\n\n1. All three religions have a shared acceptance of=\r\n the teachings of the Old Testament prophets (Christianity, in addition to =\r\nthe accepting the Old Testament prophets, also accepts Jesus. Islam, in add=\r\nition to the Old Testament prophets and Jesus, also accepts Muhammad).\n\n2. =\r\nAnthropomorphic monotheism. The supreme god of Abrahamism is seen in very h=\r\numan terms, including in his exhibition of such very human emotions as ange=\r\nr, jealousy, prejudice and vengeance. \n\n3. A profound sense of religious ex=\r\nclusivity, creating two strictly delineated camps of &quot;believers&quot; in opposit=\r\nion to everyone else.\n\n4. The belief that there is only the sole true faith=\r\n, and that any other form of religious expression external to the &quot;one true=\r\n faith&quot; is necessarily wrong.\n\n5. The acceptance of terrorism, violence, mo=\r\nb action, looting and aggressive missionary tactics to spread their religio=\r\nn.\n\n6. A common sense of being at a war to the death with the Dharmic (&quot;Pag=\r\nan&quot;) world that preceded Abrahamic ascendency. \n\n7. The centrality of unidi=\r\nrectional prayer to commune with their god, with systematic meditation prac=\r\ntice playing either little or no part in the practice of their respective r=\r\neligions.\n\n8. A belief in the existence of angels, the devil, demonic spiri=\r\nts, etc.\n\n9. All three teach the bodily resurrection, the Final Judgment, t=\r\nhe creation of the soul at the time of conception or birth (as opposed to t=\r\nhe soul&#39;s pre-existence, which all Dharmic spiritual traditions teach), the=\r\n binding effects of sin, etc.\n\n10. The importance of a specific holy day of=\r\n the week set aside for prayer and rest: For Jews =96 Saturday. For most Ch=\r\nristians =96 Sunday. For Muslims =96 Friday. \n\nThese are only a few of the =\r\nelements of the Abrahamic worldview, of which mainstream Christianity is an=\r\n integral part.\n\nUp until 2000 years ago, the Dharmic worldview was by far =\r\nthe predominant worldview for most of humanity =96 from Ireland in the West=\r\n to the Philippines in the East. Though there were thousands of diverse ind=\r\nividual cultures, languages, foods, customs and traditions among the ancien=\r\nt Indo-European peoples, most of these ethnically varied cultures were unit=\r\ned in their deep respect for, and attempted adherence to, the Natural Way (=\r\nDharma). \n\nThis ancient uniformity in adherence to Dharma was the case for =\r\ntens of thousands of years until the radically anti-human and anti-nature A=\r\nbrahamic ideology suddenly burst upon the world scene 4000 years ago with a=\r\nn evangelical fury, religiously-inspired violence, and zealous civilization=\r\n-destroying vengeance the likes of which the civilized world had never seen=\r\n previously. Never before had the multiple ancient and noble pre-Christian =\r\ncultures of the world ever experienced such massive destruction, death, per=\r\nsecution, forced conversion, and cultural annihilation performed in the nam=\r\ne of an artificially expansive religion as it witnessed at the hands of the=\r\n new Abrahamic ideology that had arrived, seemingly out of nowhere, onto th=\r\ne world stage. It was in the wake of this never before experienced juggerna=\r\nut of Biblically inspired destruction that the light of Dharma began to swi=\r\nftly wane, and that Reality as it was known up till then was turned literal=\r\nly on its head.  \n\nReligiously inspired imperialism began with the more loc=\r\nalized expansion of the Israelites in the Levant region two thousand years =\r\nbefore the birth of Christianity.  However, it was soon after the appropria=\r\ntion of the original teachings and spiritual movement of Jesus, and the mas=\r\nsive expanse of this later, corrupt form of post-Constantine Christianity, =\r\nthat the expansion of the Abrahamic ideology began to take on truly global =\r\nproportions. As the French thinker Alain de Benoist explains this catastrop=\r\nhe in the context of European history, \n\n&quot;. . . the conversion of Europe to=\r\n Christianity and the more or less complete integration of the European min=\r\nd into the Christian mentality, was one of the most catastrophic events in =\r\nworld history - a catastrophe in the proper sense of the word...&quot; \n\nWith th=\r\ne ascent of the Abrahamic onslaught came the counter-proportional descent o=\r\nf the Indo-European world&#39;s traditional Dharmic civilizations.  \n\nChristian=\r\nity, in retrospect, was but one of several artificially constructed, new mo=\r\nvements that all fall under the general term &quot;Abrahamic&quot;, named after the i=\r\nnfamous founder of fanatical religious exclusivity, Abraham (1812 BC - 1637=\r\n BC).  These four anti-nature ideologies are 1) Judaism, 2) Christianity, 3=\r\n) Islam, and 4) Marxism.  Whether we speak of Judeo-Christian &quot;holy wars&quot; a=\r\nnd Inquisitions, or the bloody and unending Islamic jihads against &quot;infidel=\r\ns&quot;, or the genocide of over 100 million people in the name of Marxist revol=\r\nution, all four of these Abrahamic movements have been responsible for more=\r\n destruction, loss of life, and social mayhem than all other ideas, religio=\r\nns, and ideologies in world history combined.  \n\nThe Abrahamic onslaught ha=\r\ns been an unparalleled juggernaut of death. More, while all four ideologies=\r\n have remained seemingly divided by dogmatic, sectarian concerns, all Abrah=\r\namic movements have been fanatically united in both their common origin, an=\r\nd in their shared aim of annihilating their perceived enemy of Dharma from =\r\nthe earth, and seeking sole domination of world power for themselves alone.=\r\n While Judaism, Christianity and Islam have been at war with each other for=\r\n millennia, they are all united in their insistence that Dharma is their pr=\r\nincipal hated enemy. The essential driving principle of Abrahamism is to br=\r\ning about the immediate death of Dharma.\n\nDharma and Abrahamism are exact o=\r\npposites in every way. Dharma and Abrahamism stand for two radically oppose=\r\nd visions for humanity&#39;s future. Dharma stands for nature, peace, diversity=\r\n, and reason. Abrahamism stands for artificiality, war, uniformity, and fan=\r\naticism. They are the only two real ideological poles of any true significa=\r\nnce in the last two-thousand years. There has been an ongoing Two-Thousand =\r\nYear War between these two opposing worldviews that has shaped the course o=\r\nf much of human history since this conflict&#39;s start. Every philosophical co=\r\nnstruct, religious denomination, political ideology and general worldview o=\r\nf the past two millennia falls squarely into one camp or the other. Every h=\r\numan being living today falls squarely into one camp or the other. Dharma a=\r\nnd Abrahamism are the only two meaningful ideological choices for humanity =\r\ntoday. And for all too much of the duration of this Two-Thousand Year War, =\r\nDharma has been on the losing end as Abrahamism has continuously succeeded =\r\nin its unrivalled ascendancy.  \n\nThe destructive ascendancy of Abrahamism i=\r\ns, however, about to come to an end. We are now about to witness a period o=\r\nf Dharmodaya - of Dharma ascending - in this very generation. As is explain=\r\ned in thorough detail in the two books &quot;The Dharma Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Sanatana=\r\n Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way&quot;, we are about to experience the rebirth o=\r\nf Dharmic and Vedic civilization throughout the totality of our world. \n\nTh=\r\ne Dharma world-view represents a positive moral and philosophical alternati=\r\nve to the many ills and cultural distortions of Abrahamic modernity. Vedic =\r\nculture is human culture, because Vedic culture is the model of spiritual c=\r\nivilization. Our world is not without meaning. Our future is not without ho=\r\npe. Though the darkness of the Kali Yuga (our current &quot;Age of Conflict&quot;) an=\r\nd a civilizational crisis has now descended upon us, the Sun of Dharma will=\r\n soon be seen again. No cloud can obscure our vision of the Sun forever. We=\r\n will live to see Dharma triumphant again, and to see a Golden Age of compa=\r\nssion, true culture, and the Natural Way be firmly established.\n\n__________=\r\n____________________________________\n\nThis article is from chapter 3 of the=\r\n groundbreaking new political work &quot;The\nDharma Manifesto&quot;, by Sri Dharma Pr=\r\navartaka Acharya.
