At the new house, mil=\r\nk was\nbeing supplied very late; sometimes as late as even 8 or 9 a.m.\n\nAs I=\r\n had no work to do till then, I was going to the Ashram in the early\nmornin=\r\ng hours. A lady devotee who is rather egoistic, was coming there\nearlier st=\r\nill. There used to be two or three ladies also with her.\n\nWhile I was sitti=\r\nng somewhere near the back door of the dining hall, they\nwere sitting right=\r\n in front of the main door which was facing the bathroom\nof Bhagavan. Accor=\r\nding to the existing practice, the bell for the breakfast\nused to be rung a=\r\ns Bhagavan came out of the bathroom and he went direct into\nthe dining hall=\r\n.\n\nBhagavan expressed several times his embarrassment about his going in fo=\r\nr\nbreakfast while some devotees were waiting just opposite to him without\nh=\r\naving had their breakfast: =E2=80=9CLook at that. While all those are stand=\r\ning\nthere with empty stomachs, not having even their morning coffee I feel\n=\r\nawkwardin going in and eating sumptuously.=E2=80=9D\n\nNo serious notice was =\r\ntaken of his remarks. One day, after having his\nbreakfast he was going out =\r\nto the hill when he happened to notice me\nstanding at the back door. Grieve=\r\nd at it he remarked, =E2=80=9CSee. Nagamma also is\nstanding there.\n\nShe doe=\r\ns not eat anything in the nights. She looks tired. She is not able to\nhave =\r\nher morning coffee because the milkman comes late.
