It is given in al=\r\nl sources that Brahma created Devas, Manushyas and Rakshasas.  He created t=\r\nhe first manu.  All the Devarishis are created by him as well as the prajap=\r\natis the Vasus etc.  He therefore needs to be worshipped as our creator who=\r\n we need to thank for all that we are and all that we have.\n\nIt is sad that=\r\n man sees God only as a source of something- happiness, wealth, knowledge, =\r\netc.  \n\nDo we worship our parents just because they give us something or be=\r\ncause we love them?\n\nBrahman occupies all the known universe and beyond.  H=\r\nis manifestation in this creation is as Saguna brahman with the manifestati=\r\non as Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.  Only because the Vaishnavaite and Shai=\r\nvite sampradayas have developed this discrepancy is obvious. All three are =\r\nequally the manifestation of the Brahman and therefore need to be worshippe=\r\nd out of love not out of desire.\n\nNirguna Brahman has all the Gunas and no =\r\none guna and all the Upanishads recommend the worship of the Divine in this=\r\n form.  The inability of most ordinary mortals to concentrate on a formless=\r\n diety is cited as the most common reason for Pratima puja and Ishta Devata=\r\n puja.\n\nPlease forgive me if I am wrong in my thoughts but I feel I should =\r\nclarify my doubts.\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; On worshipping creator Brahma (&quot;our f=\r\nather&quot;):\n&gt;  \n&gt; Is he really our &quot;father&quot;? Where did he come from? According=\r\n to Yoga Vasishtha, there are many Brahmas who come and go in the lifespan =\r\nof one Vishnu and many Vishnus who come and go in the lifespan of one Shiva=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aren&#39;t all these higher deities coming from (and going into) the Su=\r\npreme Cosmic Being? Then, shouldn&#39;t he be called the father?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Secondly=\r\n, Brahma creates and causes various different kinds of self-awareness. Wors=\r\nhip of Vishnu allows this self-awareness to pursue its various interests. W=\r\norship of Shiva allows it to undo itself and merge back with true Self. Wha=\r\nt will one gain from the worship of Brahma who creates variety and causes p=\r\nerception of variety? It is only meaningful to manage the existing variety,=\r\n wade through it and overcome it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; On worshi=\r\npping Nirguna Parabrahma (Brahman):\n&gt;  \n&gt; Each deity has dominion over a sp=\r\necific area in the field of duality. As we wade through the field of dualit=\r\ny, we contemplate on those deities for mastery over (or benefits in) that a=\r\nrea. But Nirguna Parabrahma (Brahman) has no specific gunas (he has all gun=\r\nas and yet beyond their reach) and has no specific dominion (he thinks, des=\r\nires, knows, perceives and acts though all beings of this universe, includi=\r\nng various deities, demons, human beings and animals). Then, what do you wo=\r\nrship Him for and how?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yoga Vaasishtham has=\r\n a beautiful description of how to worship the Supreme Lord, who permeates =\r\nthe self of all beings in this universe. It says (a very brief summary), &quot;t=\r\nhere is no point in offering flowers or lamp or incense etc to Supreme Lord=\r\n. One worships the Surepeme Lord by engaging in actions non-volitionally, a=\r\nccepting what comes naturally, going with the flow with neither excitement =\r\nnor worry, being neither attracted nor averse to anything, experiencing ple=\r\nasure and pain, happiness and sadness with an equal vision. One worships th=\r\ne Supreme by offering all desires, thoughts and actions, including the ones=\r\n sanctioned by scriptures as well as the ones forbidden by scriptures, to S=\r\nupreme Lord with a calm and equanimous mind.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: Correct wor=\r\nship of the Surepeme Lord can only be performed by a self-realized person. =\r\n[Other people are also actually worshipping Supreme Lord through all their =\r\nthoughts, desires, perception and actions, but they are not aware of it and=\r\n hence the worship is incorrect.]\n&gt;  \n&gt; Because the bar is set so high for =\r\nworshipping the Supreme Lord, we normally worship simpler deities with spec=\r\nific gunas, dominion, description etc. An unrealized mind can also relate t=\r\no those deities and experience love and devotion for them. It is far more p=\r\nractical for many people than worshipping the Supreme Lord.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, =\r\none can try to worship one deity (Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Lakshmi, G=\r\nanesha, Surya, Hanuman etc), get close to him and then worship the Supreme =\r\nLord though *that* deity. That is a far more practical way to reach the Sup=\r\nreme Lord for most people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; By the way, Aksh=\r\naya Triteeya is from 10:35 pm GMT on 2010 May 15 till 8:58 pm GMT on 2010 M=\r\nay 16. It is a very auspicious day for spiritual sadhana. It is the birthda=\r\ny of Ganga, who symbolizes purity. Though some jewllers are marketing in mo=\r\ndern times as a good day to buy gold, Ganga does not represent gold but rep=\r\nresents internal purity. It is a day that is conducive to bringing in inter=\r\nnal purity. Spiritual sadhana done on that day is supposed to be 1000 times=\r\n more effective than on a normal day.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;=\r\n ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --=\r\n-- R D &lt;r_desai2002@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All the great rishi=\r\ns and leaders of both Dwaita and Advaita are aware of the Vedas.
