It is really a beutiful specta=\r\ncle to see a smoke line connecting burning tip of agarabaati and Agni of th=\r\ne Havan kuna.\nBut we all know that it is due to the sucking effect of vaccu=\r\nm created due to fire which draws the smoke of agarabatti towards itself - =\r\nBhakto ko science se kya lena dena:)\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranam,=\r\n Narasimha ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; We sometimes get carried away by imagination. My questi=\r\non is whether there is any role for imagination or should we shut our minds=\r\n to fantasies?\n&gt; \n&gt; When we are near the real thing maybe there is no role =\r\nfor imagination. However, when that is not the case there may be certain lo=\r\nngings that may lead to imagination.\n&gt; \n&gt; For me, i have not been able to i=\r\nmagine a personal deity. u can call it my bad luck. But on your advise that=\r\n one should begin with Mahaganapathi homam, i am trying to develop a relati=\r\nonship with him. \n&gt; \n&gt; There are many attributes of Ganapathi that i am beg=\r\ninning to become conscious of(i looked up the wiki). what i pray to is some=\r\none joyous and dancing, someone who governs intelligence (siddhi), and, of =\r\ncourse, the remover of vighna. i imagine the twists and turns of his trunk =\r\n(vakra tunda?) to be the twists and turns within me, my own crookendness.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; i have a small metallic idol of ganesha that i use for the homam. Latel=\r\ny i have started imagining the four arms of ganesha as the arms of the flam=\r\nes in the havana. that makes me wonder whether the arms of various deities =\r\nare a depiction of sun flares...a central energy point from where these sho=\r\not out.\n&gt; \n&gt; somehow i like the heat of the flames on the face and imagine =\r\nthat maybe some purification is taking place when i bend down to the fire t=\r\nowards the end of the homam. The smoke of the agarbatti dances around the t=\r\nhe kund and sometimes enters into it, almost as if it had a live presence.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; today was one of those rare days when i could get up early and do homa=\r\nm around 5 a.m.in an open courtyard. i imagined that the brahma muhurtam wa=\r\ns still there. i imagined that the fire got started very quickly and was br=\r\night and crackling in no time. i have a habit of turning the pieces of coco=\r\nnut with the tongs so that they would burn thoroughly. i imagine that they =\r\nthey are my past sins/karma which should reduce to ashes. Today the akshatr=\r\na, the raisens and the flower that i offered were taken away one by one by =\r\nthe ants that appeared from nowhere. it was amusing to see the flower and t=\r\nhe raisens &quot;walking&quot; away. i imagined that the ants were the ganas of ganap=\r\nathi who came for the offerings.\n&gt; \n&gt; now u may ask with all these &quot;watchin=\r\ngs&quot; and imaginings where was the mind in meditation?\n&gt; \n&gt; the answer is obv=\r\nious :)\n&gt; \n&gt; i know the imaginings are distracting and my &quot;meditation&quot; is i=\r\nmperfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; but then i have a long way to go....:(\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
