However, as they =\r\nhave a huge \n&gt; repertoire of things they can give and a nice judgment on wh=\r\nat is good \n&gt; for you, they may or may not give you what you asked for righ=\r\nt away. \n&gt; They may give you something else that is better for you (from th=\r\ne \n&gt; perspective of that deity - this can change from one deity to another,=\r\n \n&gt; but all deities have much better judgment than you!). Or, they may firs=\r\nt \n&gt; give you some responsibilities that prepare you for using what you ask=\r\ned \n&gt; for well, and give you what you asked for later.\n&gt; \n&gt; In comparison, =\r\nlower beings such as Yakshas and Yakshinis have dominion \n&gt; over specific t=\r\nhings and they give them to you if they are pleased. When \n&gt; you approach t=\r\nhem, you are taking extra responsibility for what you are \n&gt; asking for and=\r\n the consequences of getting it. It may work faster, but \n&gt; comes with a ri=\r\nsk. It may even compromise your spiritual progress. Most \n&gt; of these sadhan=\r\nas will be hidden or corrupted as Kali yuga progresses. \n&gt; With sadhana of =\r\nhigher deities, things may not work too fast or be too \n&gt; straight-forward,=\r\n but there is less risk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Feb 25, 2=\r\n012 at 5:46 PM, Bhupendra Jamnadas wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhat is the purpose of Kubera homa?

For example, one of the dikpalakas (Nirriti) i=\r\ns \n&gt; a raakshasa and we do make offerings in homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many man=\r\ntras for Kubera.

The main mantra is the last verse in s=\r\ntandard Mantra Pushpam (OM \n&gt; rAjAdhirAjAya prasahyasAhine ...  kuberAya va=\r\nishravaNAya mahArAjAya \n&gt; namaH).
