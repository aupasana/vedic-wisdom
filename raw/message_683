It is called by various names: Brahman, Paramatman, Bhagavan =\r\n[Lord], God, and so on. Whoever has realized that Truth has tried to expres=\r\ns it according to his own temperament and understanding by giving it a part=\r\nicular name. But nobody has been able to express the whole truth. &quot;What he =\r\nis, he is&quot; - that is the final conclusion of those who have realized him.\n =\r\n\n&quot;From different standpoints, Gaudapada&#39;s doctrine of no creation, Shakara&#39;=\r\ns doctrine of superimposition, Ramanuja&#39;s doctrine of transformation, and [=\r\nSri Kantha&#39;s] doctrine of Shivadvaita - each one of these is true. Again, a=\r\npart from all these doctrines, he is beyond all human expression and beyond=\r\n cognition of mind. The founders of all these philosophical systems practis=\r\ned austerities, and having received God&#39;s grace, they preached the various =\r\ndoctrines at his command. God is the subject from which these doctrines evo=\r\nlved, but he himself is beyond them.&quot;\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe nature of=\r\n god and this creation are inexpressible in words and can only be experienc=\r\ned directly. Even one who experienced cannot express accurately, for it is =\r\ninexpressible by definition. I see no point in engaging in arguments on var=\r\nious doctrines. I firmly believe that Chaitanya, Shankara, Madhva and Raman=\r\nuja were all perfected beings who experienced the highest Truth that is the=\r\nre to experience. Yet, they ended up expressing what they experienced in di=\r\nfferent words. Personally, I think that a discussion on who is more correct=\r\n is useless, as nobody can accurately capture the nature and relationship b=\r\netween god and his creation in *words*. One should instead undertake indivi=\r\ndual spiritual sadhana to realize him by direct experience.\n \n*        *   =\r\n     *\n \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa used to refer to a statement of Lord Hanum=\r\nan. Hanuman said to Rama, &quot;O Lord, while I identify myself with the body I =\r\nam your servant. When I consider myself as an individual soul, I am a part =\r\nof you. And when I look upon myself as the Atman, I am one with you - this =\r\nis my firm conviction.&quot;\n \nIt is not useful to debate exactly which statemen=\r\nt above is more correct. Most of us cannot relate to anything above. Most o=\r\nf us cannot drop individual self-identification to &quot;look upon self as the A=\r\ntman&quot;. Most of us cannot even identify with individual *soul*. Most of us c=\r\nannot rise above the body and mind. Most of us are only able to identify ou=\r\nrselves with a mass of flesh and blood that perishes sooner or later. Most =\r\nof us are only able to identify ourselves with a restless monkey called min=\r\nd that tortures itself in the jaws of six relentless enemies called desire,=\r\n anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy, which are all children of =\r\na monster called ego. Most of us are only able to identify ourselves with a=\r\n name and an image that give pride oneday and shame another and happiness o=\r\nneday and sadness another.\n \nFor such people, a comparison of the states ex=\r\nperienced when one self-identifies with different entities is useless. It i=\r\ns like a poor person in India without a passport or a ration card wondering=\r\n whether to go to US for vacation or to UK or to Italy. It is a theoretical=\r\n discussion. One should first accumulate some money and get a passport. Sim=\r\nilarly, one should do spiritual sadhana and reduce ego and refine one&#39;s sel=\r\nf-identification.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI humbly suggest that one should =\r\nfollow the teachings of the Teacher one likes. More than what you believe i=\r\ns the final destination of your travel, the immediate steps you take are im=\r\nportant in deciding the success of your spiritual journey.\n \nIf praise make=\r\ns you happy and criticism makes you sad, if pleasures excite you and pains =\r\ndepress you, if beautiful things attract you and ugly things repel you, you=\r\n have some progress to make in terms of control over mind, irrespective of =\r\nthe final destination of your spiritual journey. Whether the final destinat=\r\nion is Delhi or Agra or Benares, one at Kanya Kumari will have to first sta=\r\nrt walking towards north. Follow your chosen path and purify your conscious=\r\nness and self-identification. Reduce ego and increase surrender. THAT will =\r\nkeep you in good stead.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  F=\r\nrom: Kasim Khan \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com ; Narasimha P.V.R.

She is \n  &gt; capable o=\r\nf deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as \n  &gt; one =\r\nventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She \n  =\r\n&gt; does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom.

But, in the field of duality, we \n  &gt; have differences=\r\n due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide what \n  &gt; and how muc=\r\nh we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \n  &gt; born w=\r\nith 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \n  &gt;=\r\n When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \n=\r\n  &gt; things in the dual world that are impossible for others.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Reali=\r\nzing the non-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, but \n  &gt; t=\r\nhere are limits imposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based =\r\n\n  &gt; on the force of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one \n=\r\n  &gt; (non-dual) level and all are different at another (dual) level.\n  &gt; \n  =\r\n&gt; But it is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic =\r\n\n  &gt; point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the sa=\r\nme. We \n  &gt; should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because all=\r\n are the \n  &gt; same, but because we have no surefire way to know who is what=\r\n.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Best regards,\n  &gt; Narasimha\n  &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n  &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n  &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/tarpana\n  &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n  &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt\n  &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  &gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n  &gt; --------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------- \n  &gt; \n  &gt; ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n  &gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n =\r\n &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  &gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7=\r\n:54 PM\n  &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive toda=\r\ny\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; || Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Does i=\r\nt matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

I am going back to the period =\r\nof\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religio=\r\nus mood.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha =\r\nPort Post office near\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Dwarka.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 =\r\npm and I was getting late fee allowance\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; for\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. T=\r\nhere was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and du=\r\ne to same Dep=E2?Tt; I had friendship with some\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 shri\n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking\n  &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; about\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a wee=\r\nkly\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing=\r\n devotional songs created\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; by\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while si=\r\nnging. He was reading Ramkrishna\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngste=\r\nrs were attending this weekly\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening=\r\n. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used=\r\n to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talkin=\r\ng only about Thakur.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he sudde=\r\nnly told me--\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?oRawalbhai,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my =\r\nhome and my wife is remembering me. My\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; son\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a=\r\n few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2?=9D. -\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; -\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nt one another incident he told me that there will be a plane\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to =\r\nDwarka by Bus,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus t=\r\nire will be punctured. Yet I\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not =\r\ncome from Dwarka as was\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was su=\r\nrprising.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had som=\r\ne super\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship o=\r\nnly. I was attracted to\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should =\r\nalso be disciple of shri\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974=\r\n. At 7 pm I surrendered\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2?=\r\nTs house before Thakur picture. I prayed\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; him\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from =\r\nmy heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; grace.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwaking\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that =\r\nI have\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was ann=\r\noyed and\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; she\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy should y=\r\nou take such a hasty\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was =\r\na devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint b=\r\nut our Guru should be living one, who can guide us,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; give\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nus Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Achar=\r\nya\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2?=9D--.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her a=\r\nrguments were right at her place as people in general not\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; know\n  &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. Patel\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; has\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. H=\r\ne has never\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; asked\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel=\r\n is coming to our house\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; within\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would yo=\r\nu believe that my selection for Thakur is\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2?=9D--\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2?oHow it is possible? I don=E2?Tt believe.=\r\n=E2?=9D-\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; -\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immed=\r\niately to justify my\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2?~I want t=\r\no test your existence\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; even\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2?T\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our=\r\n great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning=\r\n with angry mood. What he told?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?~ How dare you test Thakur =\r\nthis way? Do you know what happened?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty =\r\nand I had just come to my home at 05.30\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried =\r\nto sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and =\r\ntold me that-=E2?o Go to your friend=E2?Ts\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; house. He\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is w=\r\naiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; house=E2?=\r\n=9D\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me th=\r\ne way\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want? Wh=\r\ny you are\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him in such an early morning for suc=\r\nh a silly things?=E2?T\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised th=\r\nat we had no words that\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget =\r\nthat 5th April, a miracle day in my life.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; There\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were some=\r\n more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; write\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; it sometime.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is s=\r\ntill alive on the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth.

She can mislead *anyo=\r\nne* on *anything*. What She \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; does and why She does that is so di=\r\nfficult to fathom. The only way to \n  deal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with Her is to surrende=\r\nr to Her power *fully*.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; on the other hand we are a=\r\nll a part of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW, \n  though we are all part of th=\r\ne same Divinity, we are all not the same. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  In the non-dual field=\r\n, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have di=\r\nfferences due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide \n  what &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like \n  Kri=\r\nshna is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects =\r\n\n  of the dual world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or=\r\n 3 \n  kalas, He can do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; things in the dual world that are =\r\n\n  impossible for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Realizing the non-dual Self is \n=\r\n  something that is possible for anyone, but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there are limits impo=\r\nsed \n  on what things one can do in the dual world, based &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the f=\r\norce of \n  previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (n=\r\non-dual) level \n  and all are different at another (dual) level.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; But it is \n  tough to know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, you=\r\nr basic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; point \n  holds. But I just wanted to point that all are no=\r\nt indeed the same. We \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; should be disinterested in knowing who is=\r\n what, not because all are \n  the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; same, but because we have no sur=\r\nefire way to know who is \n  what.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do \n  a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri \n  Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish \n  lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish \n  software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath \n  Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannat=\r\nh.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;=\r\nDinesh Nambisan&quot; \n  &lt;dinesh@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: \n  &lt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 \n  7:54 PM=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive \n  tod=\r\nay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; || Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh \n  ||=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

I was attracte=\r\nd to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should als=\r\no be disciple of \n  shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came.
