You, I, all these people are pieces in another k=\r\nind of chess game. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Great analogy. Manish had given this analogy to=\r\n us after he=A0completed a beautiful=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=\r\n=A0one divine chess player, and it is totally His game. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Before I c=\r\nontinue with the narration, I would like to mention a few points which I fo=\r\nund I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of t=\r\nhe third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and wa=\r\ntching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you wi=\r\nll write about this experience in a public forum. Therefore my mails.\n&gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Caveat: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor=A0sadhana, and i=\r\nt is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=A0only s=\r\nomeone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this pro=\r\ncedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was=\r\n doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Theref=\r\nore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadh=\r\nana. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Many people have a negative=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas =\r\nand Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the=\r\n philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some T=\r\nV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted =\r\nindividuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are tal=\r\nking about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora =\r\nis one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It =\r\nis neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is o=\r\nk. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respe=\r\nct for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken t=\r\nhis path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths=\r\n were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a m=\r\naster Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand objective=A0accoun=\r\nt of how a\n&gt;  powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I=\r\n am just the cronicler.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many people in this age who ha=\r\nve a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a p=\r\nath, but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell s=\r\nuch=A0people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a =\r\nfigment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thou=\r\nsands of years ago. But to go about it and=A0actually be able to do this sa=\r\ndhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or r=\r\nules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=A0and l=\r\net Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patie=\r\nnce. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature wi=\r\nll one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individu=\r\nal=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=A0kind.=A0 In th=\r\ne intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let the=\r\nm know what is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few wi=\r\nll be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will ma=\r\nke arrangements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they will be =\r\ntaught according to their capabilities. The progression will go on; there i=\r\ns nothing to fear&quot;.\n&gt; Therefore have faith, do sadhana.=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Back=\r\n to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manis=\r\nh said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available=\r\n on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we were walking t=\r\nowards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anyw=\r\nhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a=\r\n pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wo=\r\nndering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally=\r\n chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smoo=\r\nth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other =\r\nside who chased the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Manish said, &quot;Some=\r\ntimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your bre=\r\neches&quot;.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderfu=\r\nl place.=A0I did not think too much about it then since my mind was already=\r\n pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning wh=\r\nen we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pr=\r\nessure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and=\r\n said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are st=\r\nill here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of=\r\n Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.=A0=\r\nLater on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and th=\r\nat person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita G=\r\nhat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Back to=\r\n midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But =\r\nthis time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking fo=\r\nr a suitable chita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but =\r\nthey respectfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of the sams=\r\nhan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different ch=\r\nitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of yea=\r\nrs there has not been a single minute when there has not been a body burnin=\r\ng in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one =\r\nchita to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega =\r\nsize bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit ther=\r\ne, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said =\r\nlet us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=A0 but th=\r\nere is something else as well. I did not ask him what. So we\n&gt;  went to ano=\r\nther side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log=A0k=\r\naun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the =\r\ndome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make=\r\n space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Mani=\r\nsh said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, =\r\nbut all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instruct=\r\ning others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something ve=\r\nry unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected,=\r\n but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sa=\r\ndhanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes =\r\nhave either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and t=\r\nhus they do not disturb. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre =\r\nwas larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus =\r\nwas stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten m=\r\ninutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange=\r\n because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose thi=\r\ns specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense=\r\n perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Eve=\r\nry now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently =\r\nfor a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But, =\r\neverytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the =\r\ndogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt =\r\na bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being s=\r\nuch an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of =\r\nthe Chandi path=A0I could hear\n&gt;  chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relativ=\r\nes wailing as new bodies were being brought in. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Suddenly to my rig=\r\nht there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting.=\r\n The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddes=\r\ns was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting o=\r\nf the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi=\r\n was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=A0the pages of the=\r\n=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=A0I loo=\r\nked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shad=\r\now passed over my book once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept=\r\n chanting with more vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=A0 Manish =\r\nlater said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make h=\r\nis/her presence felt, even if slightly.=A0It is not an imagination but real=\r\nity and this can=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere=\r\n. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; While offering coconuts into t=\r\nhe fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stic=\r\nk which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece insid=\r\ne.I wondered if I=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I stran=\r\ngely felt natural stroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered=\r\n if=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I wo=\r\nuld happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Man=\r\nikarkina!=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one ext=\r\nra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood wh=\r\ny.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the rel=\r\natives who was standing nearby and told him=A0that the person whos body was=\r\n in the pyre has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait =\r\nany more. It was already late in the night. The person did not know what to=\r\n say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil=\r\n or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the perso=\r\nn was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another of the relati=\r\nves came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Man=\r\nish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the homa. In the =\r\nmiddle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corp=\r\nse=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a =\r\nsight to see!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=A0at the=\r\n end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives no=\r\nt to pour water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Man=\r\nish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=A0asked if they could pour =\r\nsome Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will =\r\nhappen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of wa=\r\nter but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, af=\r\nter some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi=A0samne kha=\r\ndi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reve=\r\nntially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=A0Manish&#39;s feet, but M=\r\nanish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distribute=\r\nd some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very lat=\r\ne in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addr=\r\nessed earlier) came\n&gt;  running with tears in his eyes asking for forgivenes=\r\ns for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he ha=\r\ns done no wrong, everything is all right.=A0 Later Manish said, if it was s=\r\nome other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of =\r\ntea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certa=\r\nin saint (a famous saint)=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without respon=\r\nding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied interior=\r\n=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the night. T=\r\nhe faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India so unique,=\r\n that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educated=\r\n&#39;=A0people are too rational to understand these things. God loves the simpl=\r\ne and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. =\r\nImmediately I felt as if my body existed only from my head to my heart, the=\r\nre was nothing\n&gt;  below, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as if=A0I was simply float=\r\ning on thin=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=A0curt one w=\r\nord reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; As we were walking back from Manikar=\r\nnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Ma=\r\nnikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but d=\r\noes not know how to go about it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman t=\r\no come and perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, u=\r\nnless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would =\r\nnot be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, wh=\r\nen we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, =\r\nlooking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me=\r\n that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at th=\r\ne samshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionless.&quot; At that time there was noth=\r\ning more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing =\r\nsome sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no go=\r\nod,=A0so that you are ready when\n&gt;  Nature decides to give you a push. \n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=A0we stood and observe=\r\nd Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, spec=\r\nially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish=\r\n smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms r=\r\necognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, won=\r\ndering what is going on.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thus ended my second day of observing a Ch=\r\nandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n&gt; =A0\n=\r\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rama Naam Satya Hai\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      =\r\n The INTERNET now has a personality.
