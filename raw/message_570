Was busy when you=\r\n sent mail and forgot later. I am sending this to vedic-wisdom after deleti=\r\nng your name in the mail.\n \n(1) The word rakshas means a guardian spirit. T=\r\nhe plural form is &quot;rakshaamsi&quot;. For example, the dikpalaka (direction ruler=\r\n) of the southwestern direction, Nirriti, is a demon. But he is fulfilling =\r\nan important role. These guardians are clubbed with gods in tarpana.\n \n(3) =\r\nNakshatra birthday is important for the matter of health and longevity. Sup=\r\npose you want to do a Mrityunjaya homam at the start of what you suspect wi=\r\nll be a bad year for health and longevity. Then use nakshatra birthday. Tit=\r\nhi is important for overall sense of well-being and prosperity.\n \nBoth birt=\r\nhdays are important. People advocate what they are used to. Both have their=\r\n relevance.\n \n(4) Using only one darbha is a problem. Whether you use 2 oe =\r\n3 is not a big deal in my view. Do as you please. But it should be more tha=\r\nn one or just skip darbhas.\n \n(5) Yes, it is covering this janma also. But =\r\nyou are satisfying only the souls that are in need of satisfying by svadhaa=\r\n, as indicated by the word svadhaayin. You need not worry about messing up =\r\nanything with respect to those who are alive.\n \n(6) Good suggestion. I will=\r\n definitely try.\n \n(7) Those who believe they can do a good translation are=\r\n welcome to translate. Our effort has barely started. If She wants, She wil=\r\nl send those who will do what is needed to spread this further. What I am d=\r\noing is just planting a few seeds as asked by my guru who in turn was comma=\r\nnded by the Mother. Many more people will have to come and play their roles=\r\n when the time comes, for this to become what the Mother said.\n \n(8) It wil=\r\nl. When you make offerings to Agni, Prajapati etc in the external fire, the=\r\n internal fire (bhutagni) carries those to the Agni and Prajapati within. A=\r\ns the identification with the external fire becomes stronger, bhutagni beco=\r\nmes stronger and purifies more. But calling *some* deity in the fire and ma=\r\nking some offerings is better than simple agnihotra.\n \n(9) A by-birth brahm=\r\nana who wears a sacred thread but does not do any sadhana has no use for th=\r\ne sacred thread. Someone of any caste, if he doing some spiritual sadhana, =\r\ncan benefit from wearing a sacred thread.\n \nIn fact, one who is interested =\r\nin spiritual progress, doing Gayatri mantra everyday or doing homam on a re=\r\ngular basis or doing some other sadhana, automatically becomes a brahmana a=\r\nfter a while.\n \nSacred thread acts as a grounding wire in an electric circu=\r\nit. Until energy starts flowing in the body when mantra is chanted, it has =\r\nno use. Once energy starts flowing, it regulates the flow when worn to be i=\r\nn touch with the spine.\n \nIf you are chanting Gayatri mantra and doing homa=\r\nm, it is a good idea to wear a sacred thread.\n \n(10) No view.\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nWhen I made homam manual, I had done homam many days in row, kne=\r\nw several things about homam practically and had a good insight into it. Wh=\r\nen I made the tarpana manual, I did not have much practical experience and =\r\ninsight. I was following my guru&#39;s command.\n \nOn the day I was to publish t=\r\nhe tarpana manual, I went to the Mahalakshmi idol next to my homa kundam an=\r\nd prayed to Her, &quot;O Mother, I am not really an authority on tarpana. But, w=\r\nith the intention of people benefiting from it, I made this manual as asked=\r\n by my guru. Please bless this effort. I will perform a tarpana now strictl=\r\ny following this document. Please give me a visible sign if you are blessin=\r\ng this effort and giving a go ahead&quot;. I sat down to perform tarpana. The mo=\r\nment I called gods and rishis into kalasam, there was a really heavy wind. =\r\nIt was sunny that whole morning with not many clouds. It had not rained for=\r\n a few days. But the moment I made the second tarpana and said &quot;om vishnuh =\r\ntripyataam&quot;, suddenly it started raining. It was not heavy rain, but light =\r\nrain with really large drops of rain water that slowly turned into a regula=\r\nr rain and continued for the rest of the day. Rain with large drops is cons=\r\nidered auspicious in tradition. Like this, the Mother gave me some good sig=\r\nns and gave me confidence that Her blessings were with us on this effort.\n =\r\n\nObviously, She wants some people to benefit from the practice of tarpana a=\r\nnd homam. That is why She is doing all this through us.\n \nBest regards,\nNar=\r\nasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nD=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.o=\r\nrg\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ramakrishna \n  To: Narasimha P.V.R.

Can you=\r\n please clarify them ?\n\n                [Some of them are not related to Ta=\r\nrpana, but I thought instead of sending a different mail, I will ask all of=\r\n them in one]\n\n                1) In Deva tarpana, I see we are offering ta=\r\nrpana to pisaachas (and I see a word &quot;rakshaamsi&quot; - assuming it is for raak=\r\nshasas). Why are we offering tarpana to the bad souls ? Even if we offer th=\r\nem say out of pity or so, should we be giving them so much importance that =\r\nwe are offereing them along with Devas and before rishis and our own pitris=\r\n ?\n\n                2) What is the significance of not doing tarpna on the =\r\nspecific days with specific thithis. (This is just out of my curiousity, if=\r\n you feel it needs a lot of depth, please ignore)\n\n                3) You m=\r\nentioned that we should not perfrom tarpana on our Birthday. I am thoroughl=\r\ny confused on when we should celebrate our Birthday. Tamils and Karalites c=\r\nelebrate based on their birth star. One priest told me Andhra and Karnataka=\r\n people celebrate as per thithi. So I chose thithi. But some other priest t=\r\nold me tithis should be used only for observing deaths not for births.\n\n   =\r\n             Which one should I follow (I&#39;m from Andhra Pradesh) ?\n\n       =\r\n         4) A local priest told me that we should be holding two darbas and=\r\n not three. I&#39;m assuming this is just a difference on the tradition and no =\r\nharm with 3 either.\n\n                5) For the obvious traditional beliefs=\r\n, all the priests here strongly discouraged me from doing pitri tarpana (th=\r\ney are okay with Deva and Rishi tarpana) since my parents are alive. Howeve=\r\nr my father was convinced with the explanation you gave in the doc and gave=\r\n his consent. So I proceeded.\n\n                But I still have some slight=\r\n discomfort. The Mantra says &#39;Sarva Janmeshu ....&#39; Is n&#39;t this covering thi=\r\ns Janma also ?\n\n                6) It would be good if you could make a vid=\r\neo of the presentation and upload. I was confused about how to hold the dar=\r\nbas and did in the way I understood. Actually this is one request I have fo=\r\nr your homa too. Some times we interpret the statements incorrectly and som=\r\netimes when we start following the doc, we get a different doubt. With the =\r\nvideo, it is clear.\n\n                This is one of the reasons why I wante=\r\nd to meet you when you were in India, so I can learn doing homa directly un=\r\nder you. But for some reason it did not work out. If you could make a video=\r\n, that would help people like me a lot. \n\n                7) How about maki=\r\nng translations of your Homa and Tarpana in different languages ? For examp=\r\nle my father does not know english and all of sudden, he wanted to perform =\r\nagnihotra after hearing about it by someone that it purifies atmosphere. Lu=\r\nckily I had a book on agnihotra by the Akkalkot ashram in Telugu and mailed=\r\n him.\n\n                Similarly when I told him about Mahalaya Amavasya, h=\r\ne wanted to perform tarpana but no manual for him. \n\n                8) Wha=\r\nt is the role of Agnihotra ? Will it too purify out bhootagni or it is just=\r\n for offering food to Agni, Surya and Prajapati ?\n\n                9) What =\r\nis the significance of the sacred-thread ? What is your opinion on non-brah=\r\nmins wearing that ? If am already chanting Gayatri mantra(as per your proce=\r\ndure - Om Bhur.. one time, and ensclosing &#39;tat savi..&#39; in Om at beginning a=\r\nnd end every time we chant), do you think I will get additional benefit in =\r\nwearing the sacred thread and getting initiated in to Gayatri. (the person =\r\nwho is initiating is most probably not a sadhaka and I don&#39;t think will be =\r\ngiving me any part of his mantra sidhi. Plus he is a simple priest and I ha=\r\nve no plans to treat him as my Guru and so I do not want to take his power =\r\neven if he is willing to give me)To me he is just a qualified person to giv=\r\ne sacred thread with a liberal view towards it.\n\n                10) Finall=\r\ny, there is a belief that marriages should not be performed till 1 year whe=\r\nre there was a death. Somewhere I read that after 10 (or 11) days the soul =\r\nleaves the place and begins its journey. So I don&#39;t see why this rule was t=\r\nhere. Can you please let me know your view on this ?\n\n                Thank=\r\ns and Regards,\n                &lt;deleted&gt;\n               \n       \n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_04B8_01C936FD.5ACF2340\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3429&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;My sincere apologies for not replying earlier.

It was \nnot heavy rain, but light rain with really large drops=\r\n of rain water that slowly \nturned into a regular rain and continued for th=\r\ne rest of the day. Rain with \nlarge drops is considered auspicious in tradi=\r\ntion. Like this, the Mother gave me \nsome good signs and gave me confidence=\r\n that Her blessings were with us on this \neffort.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;O=\r\nbviously, She wants some people to benefit from \nthe practice of tarpana an=\r\nd homam.

Why are we=\r\n offering tarpana to the bad souls ? Even \n                if we offer them=\r\n say out of pity or so, should we be giving them \n                so much i=\r\nmportance that we are offereing them along with Devas \n                and =\r\nbefore rishis and our own pitris ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;2) What is the sign=\r\nificance of not doing tarpna on the \n                specific days with spe=\r\ncific thithis. (This is just out of my \n                curiousity, if you =\r\nfeel it needs a lot of depth, please \n                ignore)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n       =\r\n         &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n             =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;3) You mentioned that we should not perfrom tarpana on our \n       =\r\n         Birthday. I am thoroughly confused on when we should celebrate \n  =\r\n              our Birthday. Tamils and Karalites celebrate based on their \n=\r\n                birth star. One priest told me Andhra and Karnataka people =\r\n\n                celebrate as per thithi. So I chose thithi. But some other=\r\n \n                priest told me tithis should be used only for observing d=\r\neaths \n                not for births.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;Which one shoul=\r\nd I follow (I&#39;m from Andhra Pradesh) ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;4) A local prie=\r\nst told me that we should be holding two \n                darbas and not th=\r\nree. I&#39;m assuming this is just a difference on \n                the traditi=\r\non and no harm with 3 either.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;5) For the obvious tradi=\r\ntional beliefs, all the priests \n                here strongly discouraged =\r\nme from doing pitri tarpana (they are \n                okay with Deva and R=\r\nishi tarpana) since my parents are alive. \n                However my fathe=\r\nr was convinced with the explanation you gave in \n                the doc a=\r\nnd gave his consent. So I proceeded.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;But I still have=\r\n some slight discomfort. The Mantra says \n                &#39;Sarva Janmeshu .=\r\n...&#39; Is n&#39;t this covering this Janma also \n                ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        =\r\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;6) It would be good if you could make a video of the \n              =\r\n  presentation and upload. I was confused about how to hold the \n          =\r\n      darbas and did in the way I understood. Actually this is one \n       =\r\n         request I have for your homa too. Some times we interpret the \n   =\r\n             statements incorrectly and sometimes when we start following t=\r\nhe \n                doc, we get a different doubt. With the video, it is \nc=\r\nlear.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;This is one of the reasons why I wanted to meet =\r\nyou when \n                you were in India, so I can learn doing homa dire=\r\nctly under you. \n                But for some reason it did not work out. I=\r\nf you could make a \n                video, that would help people like me a=\r\n lot. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;7) How about making translations of your Homa a=\r\nnd Tarpana \n                in different languages ? For example my father =\r\ndoes not know \n                english and all of sudden, he wanted to perf=\r\norm agnihotra after \n                hearing about it by someone that it pu=\r\nrifies atmosphere. Luckily \n                I had a book on agnihotra by th=\r\ne Akkalkot ashram in Telugu and \n                mailed him.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        =\r\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Similarly when I told him about Mahalaya Amavasya, he \n             =\r\n   wanted to perform tarpana but no manual for him. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;8=\r\n) What is the role of Agnihotra ? Will it too purify out \n                b=\r\nhootagni or it is just for offering food to Agni, Surya and \n              =\r\n  Prajapati ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;9) What is the significance of the sacre=\r\nd-thread ? What is \n                your opinion on non-brahmins wearing th=\r\nat ? If am already \n                chanting Gayatri mantra(as per your pro=\r\ncedure - Om Bhur.. one \n                time, and ensclosing &#39;tat savi..&#39; i=\r\nn Om at beginning and end \n                every time we chant), do you thi=\r\nnk I will get additional benefit \n                in wearing the sacred thr=\r\nead and getting initiated in to \n                Gayatri. (the person who i=\r\ns initiating is most probably not a \n                sadhaka and I don&#39;t th=\r\nink will be giving me any part of his \n                mantra sidhi. Plus h=\r\ne is a simple priest and I have no plans to \n                treat him as m=\r\ny Guru and so I do not want to take his power even \n                if he i=\r\ns willing to give me)To me he is just a qualified person \n                t=\r\no give sacred thread with a liberal view towards it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;1=\r\n0) Finally, there is a belief that marriages should not be \n               =\r\n performed till 1 year where there was a death. Somewhere I read \n         =\r\n       that after 10 (or 11) days the soul leaves the place and begins \n   =\r\n             its journey. So I don&#39;t see why this rule was there. Can you \n=\r\n                please let me know your view on this ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Thanks and Regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n     =\r\n           &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \n          size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n  &lt;P=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_04B8_01C936FD.5ACF2340--\r\n\n"}}
