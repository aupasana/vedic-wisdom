For example, one must do japam by a co=\r\nunt of 10,000 before one does homam by a count of 1,000.\nComment: This conv=\r\nention is not without reason. The true meaning of this convention is that h=\r\nomam is ten times more powerful than japam. If one does a mantra 1,000 in a=\r\n homam, it is equivalent to doing the mantra 10,000 in japam. If one wants,=\r\n one can offer the mantra entirely in external fire and there is no need to=\r\n do any japam before doing homam.\nAll thumb rules and conventions have exce=\r\nptions. If a rishi with a very strong bhootaagni does japam, it is equivale=\r\nnt to a homam and the &quot;ten times&quot; rule does not apply. However, for most no=\r\nrmal people, homam is ten times more powerful than japam. The bottomline is=\r\n that the strength and the purity of the medium that accommodates the prese=\r\nnce of the deity who receives the mantra will decide the effectiveness of t=\r\nhe mantra.&quot;\nI personally feel that the rules and regulations present in Hin=\r\nduism will only deter many seekers.Fear is already a big part in our life.\n=\r\n\nRegards\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikanth&quot; &lt;ashutos=\r\nh.srikanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; I have been performing week=\r\nly havan for more than a year and half.\n&gt; I want to point out certain thing=\r\ns related to havan so that it can be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; I=\r\n am using a conversation that in fact took place to bring out these relevan=\r\nt points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose sum=\r\nmary I am presenting below: \n&gt; \n&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with sim=\r\nilar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong =\r\n- called as dosha.]\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hm=\r\nm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni=\r\n karya at your home regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surpri=\r\nsed by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the havan=\r\n I did at home)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agn=\r\ni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your =\r\nahuti does not seem to be right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame se=\r\neds).\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit=\r\n of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha =\r\nin my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Jap=\r\na before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that y=\r\nou use for your regular japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there=\r\n a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that i=\r\ns for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualifie=\r\nd for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 rec=\r\nitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; \n&gt; My=\r\nself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghor=\r\ne book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that book seri=\r\nes)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regu=\r\nlar chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You=\r\n have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The conversation went onto several other =\r\nthings. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished s=\r\neer and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in=\r\n homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with =\r\nmy spiritual progress since. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this=\r\n group agree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all request=\r\ning everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahut=\r\ni to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
