During the Homam, it is ok to stir the=\r\n contents of the Homa Kunda to\nget better combustion of ingredients and dis=\r\ntribution of fire or that\nshould only be done at the end of the homam?  Rea=\r\nson I am asking this\nquestion is that recently I was talking to a priest an=\r\nd he mentioned\nthat you are inviting all these devatas into the Homam Agni =\r\nso why do\nyou keep disturbing them by prodding a tong into the fire on a re=\r\ngular\nbasis in the middle of the homam?  Your thoughts please\n\n2.  What are=\r\n some of the recommended  Samputs that can be added for\nChandi Homam?  I so=\r\nmetimes add the navarana mantra after each shloka of\nthe Chandi during Homa=\r\nm as Samput as I find that makes the Homam more\npowerful but have been told=\r\n that other Samputs can be taken also such as\n&quot;namo devyai mahadevyai...&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;sarva-mangal maangalyai...&quot; after each\nshloka\n\n3.  If one is taking a S=\r\namput in the Chandi Homam, then in Chapter 5,\nshould the Samput be taken af=\r\nter each &quot;namastasyai&quot;?  Example do we have\nto go &quot;ya devi sarvabhuteshu bu=\r\nddhirupena samsthita, namastasyai (swaaha\n+ samput and swaaha), namastasyai=\r\n (swaaha + samput and swaaha),\nnamastasyai namo namah (swaaha + samput and =\r\nswaaha) or just go with the\nregular swaaha and then one samput at the end f=\r\nollowed by swaaha?\n\n4.  While taking a Samput some people take the samput t=\r\nwice for each\nshloka.  Is that the recommended norm?\n\n5.  Do you have some =\r\nguidance on offering specific ingredients for each\nchapter of the Chandi?  =\r\nThere are several books which offer guidance for\nspecific offerings during =\r\nthe 13 chapters but they are not consistent. \nI realize that everything bel=\r\nongs to her so why get too fancy but\nsometimes it is nice to get into the p=\r\nlay and offer different things out\nof love.\n\nRegards\n\nSumeet\n\n\n\n\r\n--7-2914308264-0948433526=:5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;Narasimhaji and other Gurujan,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;1.&nbs=\r\np; During the Homam, it is ok to stir the contents of the Homa Kunda to get=\r\n better combustion of ingredients and distribution of fire or that should o=\r\nnly be done at the end of the homam?&nbsp; Reason I am asking this question=\r\n is that recently I was talking to a priest and he mentioned that you are i=\r\nnviting all these devatas into the Homam Agni so why do you keep disturbing=\r\n them by prodding a tong into the fire on a regular basis in the middle of =\r\nthe homam?&nbsp; Your thoughts please&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;2.&nbsp; What are some of the =\r\nrecommended&nbsp; Samputs that can be added for Chandi Homam?&nbsp; I somet=\r\nimes add the navarana mantra after each shloka of the Chandi during Homam a=\r\ns Samput as I find that makes the Homam more powerful but have been told th=\r\nat other Samputs can be taken also such as &quot;namo devyai mahadevyai...&quot; and =\r\n&quot;sarva-mangal maangalyai...&quot; after each shloka&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;3.&nbsp; If one is ta=\r\nking a Samput in the Chandi Homam, then in Chapter 5, should the Samput be =\r\ntaken after each &quot;namastasyai&quot;?&nbsp; Example do we have to go &quot;ya devi sar=\r\nvabhuteshu buddhirupena samsthita, namastasyai (swaaha + samput and swaaha)=\r\n, namastasyai (swaaha + samput and swaaha), namastasyai namo namah (swaaha =\r\n+ samput and swaaha)&nbsp;or just go with the regular swaaha and then one s=\r\namput at the end followed by swaaha?&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;4.&nbsp; While taking a Samput =\r\nsome people take the samput twice for each shloka.&nbsp; Is that the recomm=\r\nended norm?&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;5.&nbsp; Do you have some guidance on offering specific =\r\ningredients for each chapter of the Chandi?&nbsp; There are several books w=\r\nhich offer guidance for specific offerings during the 13 chapters but they =\r\nare not consistent.&nbsp; I realize that everything belongs to&nbsp;her so =\r\nwhy get too fancy but sometimes it is nice to get into the play and offer d=\r\nifferent things out of love.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Sumeet&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--7-2914308264-0948433526=:5--\r\n\n"}}
