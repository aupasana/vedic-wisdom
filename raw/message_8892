This vedic ritual according to the swami had not been performed fo=\r\nr past 5000 years in that part of the world. But this was no easy task, alr=\r\neady bounded by the time constraint, it required a hundred Brahmins who rec=\r\nite the Durga Saptashati daily, do not take money for performing any ritual=\r\ns and are ordained in the Shakta Marga, i.e. Shaktism. On the top of this i=\r\nt might take great physical labours, since most rituals would continue inde=\r\nfinitely, day and night, until some divine intervention occurs. Also a caus=\r\ne of worry was the fact the such ritual may give unexpected and harmful res=\r\nults if done without care. Moved by the daily news of the failing Indian de=\r\nfences, the swami decided to go ahead with the programme. Accordingly sermo=\r\nns were issued, to all parts of India where such willing Brahmins could be =\r\nfound, a large number of them came from Varanasi, as expected. But only 84 =\r\nsuch Brahmins could be assembled in such a short duration of time, the yagn=\r\na began nonetheless. The temple complex was cordoned off for one and all, n=\r\no monetary help was taken from outside, neither was the programme publicize=\r\nd. The Brahmins started the rituals which among others included the recitat=\r\nion of all the four vedas, use of the spiritually collected power against t=\r\nhe enemy of the country and it all supposedly happened under the powers of =\r\ngoddess Bagalamukhi and Dhumavati. Goddess Bagalamukhi was worship in the d=\r\nays to stop the enemy from further advances (the process called Sttambhan) =\r\nwhile goddess Dhumavati was worshiped during the nights to force the enemy =\r\nback (the process called Uchhatan). The durations of the yagna, thirty thre=\r\ne days, was marked with supernatural experiences by every one involved in t=\r\nhe rituals, the swami would listen to them and based on his interpretation =\r\nof the signs, would decide the next ritual. Even as the Yagna was at its pe=\r\nak, the much expected news of the ceasefire arrived. A personal account by =\r\na man, called Gopaldas Mishr, who was involved in the yagna is as follows\n\n=\r\nThe eighty four Brahmins would recite the Durga Saptashati in the day&#39;s lig=\r\nht with a Samputt (that included the name of the then Premiere of China Zho=\r\nu Enlai), while in the night eleven Brahmins would meditate, with japa on g=\r\noddess Dhumavati, from 9 P.M. to 4 A. M. . I was instructed by Swami Ji Mah=\r\naraj to observe the picture of goddess Dhumavati and report immediately to =\r\nhim as soon as any sign was seen. For ten days the recitations went on unhi=\r\nndered, on the eleventh day, during the midnight a horribly strong animal l=\r\nike sound was heard in the traditional gymnasium situated in the Peeth, all=\r\n of us were fearful. But interestingly the swami was happy and said &quot;the be=\r\nginning is auspicious, go now and carry on with your work &quot;. Perhaps it was=\r\n the fourteenth day that I was ordered, by the goddess&#39; picture &quot;I am hungr=\r\ny&quot;, I reported to the swami, to that Shree Swami Ji replied &quot;She is always =\r\nhungry, it very difficult to feed her, yet take some rice, ghee, gur, curd =\r\netc.. and feed Her&quot;. Accordingly the second next day we went to the pond ne=\r\narby where a Tantric Animal ate it. Next day the goddess hinted that she re=\r\nmains hungry still, the swami ordered to increase the sacrificial offering.=\r\n The same Tantric Animal came next day to eat the offerings . The next day =\r\nthe goddess complained that the Japa is lesser by five japamalas, the swami=\r\n ordered to increase as per the goddess&#39; desire. Finally it was on the twen=\r\nty first day, that I was almost half asleep that the Mother Goddess appeare=\r\nd and caught my hand saying &quot;sit with Me in the motor and come to China&quot; to=\r\n which I requested &quot;I am doing the ritual, how can I leave it incomplete ? =\r\nplease You go alone.&quot; The Mother sat in the car, just as I heard a sound of=\r\n starting of the motor, the mother disappeared before my eyes. When I repor=\r\nted this to the swami he lamented that &quot;you did a mistake, you should have =\r\ngone with the Mother, well now, I will have to go &quot;. Shree Swami Ji and oth=\r\ners who were doing the Japa saw that the Mother wielding a whip and punishi=\r\nng the Chinese while standing on the bonnet of the car. The very next day i=\r\nt was published in the newspapers that Chinese are retreating and indeed it=\r\n did so.\n=97Shri Swami Smriti , Grantha part I pg. 288\nThe worsened relatio=\r\nn of the China and the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1960&#39;s was according to so=\r\nme participants, the result of the yagna. Some of his lifelong devotees are=\r\n of the opinion that this was his single most important event in his life. =\r\nA good account of this event was published in the Illustrated Weekly of Ind=\r\nia dated 6 October 1963 0n page number 19 under the title Chiaroscuro, alth=\r\nough the writer and the correspondent did not reveal their own identity.\n\n\n=\r\n\n2]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghavendra_Swami\n\nRaghavendra Swami \nOnc=\r\ne while he was touring Kumbakonam along with his wife, Sri Venkatanatha and=\r\n his family was invited to attend a function. Unfortunately, the hosts did =\r\nnot treat him well and wanted him to earn his food by running a chore. So t=\r\nhey asked him to make some sandalwood paste for all the invitees. Sri Venka=\r\ntanatha per his habit, was chanting stotras and mantras while preparing san=\r\ndalwood for Tilaka. When the guests applied this paste, it induced a burnin=\r\ng sensation all over their bodies. Surprised by this, the hosts sought a cl=\r\narification from Venkatanatha. He replied that the burning sensation was du=\r\ne to the Agni Suktam (hymn for the worship as defined in the Esoteric Vedas=\r\n) that he was chanting while preparing sandalwood and thus eternal power of=\r\n Vedic Mantras revealed itself. This happens only when chanted with absolut=\r\ne dedication and devotion. The power is enhanced since it was chanted by so=\r\nmeone as virtuous and devoted to Bhagavan Hari as himself. Upon realizing h=\r\nis devotion and power, the host apologized profusely to Sri Venkatanatha an=\r\nd sought his forgiveness.\n\nSri Venkatanatha then prepared the paste again b=\r\nut chanted the Vedic Mantra to Varuna (Vedic rain gods) this time. It has b=\r\neen recorded that when the guests applied this paste, they were awash with =\r\na sense of being drenched in rainwater, reaffirming Sri Venkatanatha&#39;s powe=\r\nr of devotion\n\n\n\n\n"}}
