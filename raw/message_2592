I was wondering whether this is due to something\nI am doing incorrectly (or possibly due to using an inferior form of\ncamphor), or whether it is a natural effect of doing the homam. I&#39;ve\nbeen doing weekly homas for a while now, but for Navaratri, I have\nstarted daily homa and the effect has been more pronounced.\n\nFor the homa, I use two camphor tablets (one to light the fire, one as\nnirajanam offering), dried coconut halves, ghee, and havan samagri\nconsisting of seeds, leaves and herbs.\n\nI would appreciate anyone&#39;s feedback (or suggestions on how to reduce\nthe amount of soot).\n\nOr, perhaps the soot is an auspicious thing, and I should not be\nwanting to reduce it!\n\nWarm regards, and best wishes for Navaratri,\nAditi\n\n"}}
