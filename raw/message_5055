However, gods are not really sleeping and do not need to be woken up. If you chant any mantra or any prayer, including Vishnu and Lalita sahasra naama stotras, it does reach them at all times.\n \nThe key is to chant with whatever level of mental focus, devotion and discipline one can manage.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe goal of any spiritual practice, whether it is chanting a mantra, meditation, bhajan, homam, tantra or whatever, is to affect an internal transformation.\n \nExternal rituals help develop discipline, but, in order to bring internal transformation, they need to be augmented with some amount of contemplation. If one reads scriptures or books about modern saints like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the ideas from those books can serve as platforms of contemplation and bring about internal transformation.\n \nIt is a good idea to mix reading and thinking with rituals. \n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajmohansrinivas &lt;yrskmohan@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I came across few friends who chant Vishnu & Lalita Sahasranamas during early morning. Large number of people also believe that only Suprabhatams should be chanted in the morning and all Sahasranamas have to be done in the evenings. Which one is correct? \n&gt; \n&gt; Learned members, I request you to enlighten me on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Love to all,\n&gt; Rajmohan\n\n\n"}}
