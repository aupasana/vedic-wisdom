Can a homam\n&gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a\n&gt; copper one?\n \nYes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n \nYes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n \n&gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the\n&gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n \nOne can repeat mentally while listening attentively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n \nSuppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;. One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n \nHowever, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n \n&gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n \nYes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n \nOne should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n \nBy the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n \nAs long as one desires no specific material benefits (and ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.\n \n&gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?\n \nFor Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.\n \n*        *        *\n \nMentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.\n \nWhen I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n \nTo my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few questions\n&gt; regarding it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors)?
