Playing any part in t=\r\nhis is bad \n&gt; karma. But, realistically, our role is much smaller than some=\r\n big fish \n&gt; who are manipulating food prices for making quick millions. Th=\r\ney don&#39;t \n&gt; know what they are getting into.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overeating is not good fo=\r\nr either physical or mental or spiritual \n&gt; well-being. Whether it is bette=\r\nr than throwing away food is debatable. \n&gt; Both are bad ideas. Try to buy, =\r\nprepare and serve the right amount of \n&gt; food, so as to avoid wastage. Also=\r\n, feeding any extra food to someone \n&gt; who needs it is far better than thro=\r\nwing it away or overeating forcibly.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, don&#39;t worry about a few spec=\r\nific cases. If you have the right \n&gt; attitude overall, that&#39;s what matters.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Imagine food being a goddess (Mother Annapoorna). Don&#39;t tell her, &quot;I =\r\nam \n&gt; rich. I can afford to do whatever I want to do with you.&quot; Instead, be=\r\n \n&gt; humble and grateful to her and let her help you and as many others as \n=\r\n&gt; possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Feb 21, 2012 at 3:0=\r\n7 PM, scsa_taker3 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Ram,\n&gt; There is no sin, bhai sahab.

A lot of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; people are starvi=\r\nng without food to eat. As those who can afford food \n&gt; &gt;&gt; waste the limite=\r\nd food that is available, that jacks up food prices \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and makes it even=\r\n more inaccessible to starving people. This is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; already a serious prob=\r\nlem according to scientists and I am afraid \n&gt; &gt;&gt; will get much worse in co=\r\nming decades.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Given this, wasting food is a really really really terri=\r\nble sin in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; today&#39;s times. Please don&#39;t waste food. This includes:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; (1) Cooking more food than you need and throwing it away, (2) Serving \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; more food than you can eat in your plate and throwing it away (3) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nBuying more vegetables/fruits than you need and letting them get \n&gt; &gt;&gt; spoi=\r\nled\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Please treat Mother Annapurna (personification of food that sustai=\r\nns \n&gt; &gt;&gt; us) with respect, love and humility (rather than arrogance, contem=\r\npt \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and pride). World (and we) needs her blessings and kindness.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On a similar note, some ladies do rituals where ch=\r\nick peas soaked in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; water, fruits etc, sweets etc are distributed to o=\r\nther ladies. I have \n&gt; &gt;&gt; seen so many ladies casually get these food items=\r\n, let them rot and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; then throw them away. The notion that giving food =\r\nto people is good \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is based on the assumption that they actually=\r\n eat it or use \n&gt; &gt;&gt; otherwise. If they waste it, it is bad karma for both =\r\nparties.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Please do not accept any food that you cannot use. Also, don&#39;=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt;&gt; distribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, feed homeles=\r\ns, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; needy people. Doing rituals with no common sense and just for the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; heck of it, is not good. Such rituals produce no results whatsoever. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Blindly adhering to traditions that are doing no good really, is like=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; dressing a corpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use common \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; sense and do *real* good to others and the world, than engaging in \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n fake *symbols* that in reality harm the world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry for the strong l=\r\nanguage, but I do see many people abusing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mother Annapoorna and I thi=\r\nnk this is terrible for the world.
