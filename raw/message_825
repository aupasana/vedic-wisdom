Each Shloka gives you great feeling because it \ngenerates a kind =\r\nof rhythm combined with devotion. it generates \nenergy.\n\n- It is very true =\r\nthat most people immediately will not know the \nmeaning of the verses. Take=\r\n for instance my case. I can claim that i \nam considerably fluent in reciti=\r\nng Sanskrit Shlokas (Devanagari \nScript) but i hardly know grammar and many=\r\n other things in the \nlanguage. During my initial recitation, the whole rec=\r\nitation was \njust like reading with little or no understanding of the Story=\r\n. Then \ni got a book in which, on every page, Verses were given in the top =\r\n\nand at the bottom there was the Translation for the same verses. \nWhat i d=\r\nid was that i started reciting one or two verses above and \nthen used to se=\r\ne the meaning given below in the same page. Thus over \na period of time, it=\r\n became ease to understand the meaning of the \nverses *immediately* while r=\r\neciting because the meaning was already \nregistered in the back of the mind=\r\n. i am continuing the same process.\nSanskrit is supposed to be the basis of=\r\n all our Indian Languages. My \nknowledge of Gujarati, Marathi & Hindi was h=\r\nandy to understand many \nof the words of Sanskrit immediately and didn&#39;t ne=\r\ned to struggle \nmuch. Same way, for the people of India, there are many com=\r\nmon \nwords, i suppose, between Sanskrit and any regional language.\n\nThe poi=\r\nnt i wish to make here is that it is best to recite in \nSanskrit verses, ev=\r\nen if one doesn&#39;t understand the meaning. To \nsolve the issue of devotion a=\r\nnd understanding of the story, one can \ntake a book which gives verses as w=\r\nell as translation. By practicing \nto read verses as well as the translatio=\r\nn of the same, over a period \nof time, one will reach the point where the *=\r\nliteral* meaning of the \nverses will be *instantly* known without need to f=\r\nall back on \ntranslation. Our memory and brain has such great faculties. On=\r\ne can \nalso go though the whole translation part in free time. The \nrepetit=\r\nion of which, will create understanding of literal meaning of \nthe verses.\n=\r\n\nbut final aim should be recitation in Sanskrit and off-course \nDevotion wh=\r\nich should be the prime mover.\n\nHope i could really explain it effectively.=\r\n\n\nSpiritually yours,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashwinr=\r\nawal&quot; &lt;ashwinrawal@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sir Narsimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; There are =\r\ntwo thinking for Chandipath chanting.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Every verse in Chandipath is =\r\na mantra and reading of Chandipath \nin\n&gt; Sanskrit is more meaningful to ple=\r\nase Goddess and to get desired\n&gt; results. It is created in Sanskrit and whe=\r\nther we may follow the \nmeaning\n&gt; of the verses or not, we should read in S=\r\nanskrit only if we can \nread\n&gt; Sanskrit fluently because every Verse has it=\r\ns vibrations with full \nof\n&gt; energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. If we read in Sanskrit, we nev=\r\ner involve ourselves in \nthe &#39;Lila&#39; of\n&gt; Durga nor we enjoy the story of Ja=\r\nnma(Birth) of different Shakties\n&gt; narrated in Chandipath  (This is only po=\r\nssible for those who are\n&gt; scholars in Sanskrit and can translate each and =\r\nevery verse \nimmediately\n&gt; while reading. For others it is simply reading w=\r\nith faith and\n&gt; devotion.)- Better way is, it should be read in regional la=\r\nnguage \nwith\n&gt; full involvement in the &#39;Lila&#39;. Here we can enjoy the differ=\r\nent \nroles of\n&gt; Shaktis, fully understand the differnet Births etc. This ty=\r\npe of \nreading\n&gt; makes Chandipath more meaningful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sir, I request=\r\n your advice as what is the real way of \nchanting Sri\n&gt; Chandipath from the=\r\nse two?\n&gt; \n&gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
