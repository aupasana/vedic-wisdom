In gratitude for\nKandasw=\r\nami=E2=80=99s labours Sri Bhagavan named the Asramam after him as\nSkandasra=\r\nmam. Sri Bhagavan stayed here from 1916 to 1922 before moving\npermanently t=\r\no the present Ramanasramam at the foot hills of Arunachala.\n\nAt Virupaksha =\r\ncave besides Pazhaniswami, others like Perumalswami and\nKandaswami began to=\r\n attach themselves permanently to the Sri Bhagavan and to\nlive with Him. =\r\n=E2=80=98Share and share alike=E2=80=99 was always Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s m=\r\notto; and\nfood had to be found for all of them. Since they could not feel s=\r\nure of\nfeeding all the visitors,Pazhaniswami and other dependants would sta=\r\nrt from\nthe Hill and go to the town to beg food. They used to go about begg=\r\ning in\nthe streets for food and bring it up the Hill and everyone used to s=\r\nhare it.\nSometimes there used to be just rice,sometimes a mixture of everyt=\r\nhing from\nsweetmeats to savouries, but the Swami used to make it so tasty t=\r\nhat\nwhatever they got, they used to be extremely satisfied with. Perumalswa=\r\nmi\nand Kandaswami used to blow in concert on the conch.When leaving thus th=\r\ney\nwould blow a long blast on their conches. This was an announcement to th=\r\ne\ntownspeople that Swami=E2=80=99s party had left the cave on their begging=\r\n mission.\nThey would give another blast when they reached the foot of the H=\r\nill, a\nthird call would be sounded at the entrance to the street. All the r=\r\nesidents\nof the street would be ready with their offerings and the party wo=\r\nuld march\nalong the street singing Siva namavalis and collecting the offeri=\r\nngs. This\nwould suffice to feed the Swami, his attendants, visitors and all=\r\n the\nmonkeys, both day and night.\n\nKandaswami was anxious to build a separa=\r\nte Asramam for Bhagavan. The number\nof visitors had also begun to increase.=\r\n There was no water facility near the\ncave at that time. There was not enou=\r\ngh room to cook or for people to stay.\nSome of the visitors were ladies and=\r\n Virupaksha was too small to accommodate\nall of them, hence Kandaswami=E2=\r\n=80=99s decision to build a new Asramam.In fact, as\nBhagavan had mentioned =\r\nin his deposition to the commission, the work on\nSkandasramam began as earl=\r\ny as 1902.Kandaswami inspected various places on\nthe Hill and in the forest=\r\ns to select a site.\n\nTo the west of Virupaksha Cave, there is a black rock.=\r\n Once when Bhagavan\nwent towards the rock,he saw some water oozing from und=\r\ner the rock.Bhagavan\nshowed the moist area to Jadaswami and said there migh=\r\nt be a spring there.\nJadaswami had the place dug, and out came pure, sweet =\r\nwater. Whenever\nBhagavan went there, he used to collect the pure water in h=\r\nis Kamandala for\nuse later. Kandaswami finally suggested this site for the =\r\nnew Asramam and\nwith Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s approval he began work on the n=\r\new Asramam single\nhandedly.\n\nKandaswami began converting what was a thick f=\r\norest of prickly pear on the\nMountain slope. He removed the stones around t=\r\nhe spring and cut down the\nthorny shrubs and leveled the ground.The result =\r\nof his labour & great\nself-sacrifice,unaided by any at the time, is the Ska=\r\nndasramam we see now.\nRegarding this Sri Bhagavan has said,\n\n=E2=80=9CYou c=\r\nannot imagine the state the site was in originally. Kandaswami worked\nwith =\r\nalmost superhuman effort, achieved by his own hands what even four\npeople t=\r\nogether could not have done. He removed all the prickly pear,\nreduced stone=\r\n and boulder to level ground created a garden and raised the\nAsramam. We go=\r\nt four coconut trees for planting. To plant them properly\nKandaswami dug hu=\r\nge square pits about ten feet deep. That would give you an\nidea of the amou=\r\nnt of labour he put into the work he took on hand. He was a\nstrong, well-bu=\r\nilt man.=E2=80=9D He put up a structure and planted mango, jackfruit,\ncocon=\r\nut trees and some plants in front of it. Since that Asramam was\nconstructed=\r\n in a spirit of service to Ramana, in a quiet manner and without\nany self a=\r\ndvertisement, it came to be called Skandasramam in memory of his\nname.\n\nLat=\r\ner, with the help of Perumalswami, he completed the present brick\nbuilding =\r\nand requested Sri Bhagavan to come and stay there. Sri Bhagavan\nstayed at S=\r\nkandasramam from 1916 to 1922.Kandaswami spent some time with Sri\nBhagavan =\r\nand later returned to his birth place. Kandaswami never returned to\nTiruvan=\r\nnamalai. There was no further news of him.\n\nOnce, in later years after movi=\r\nng down to live in Ramanasramam, Bhagavan\nshowed devotees a group photo in =\r\nwhich Kandaswami,\nPerumalswami,Pazhaniswami, Sivaprakasam Pillai, Narayana =\r\nReddi,Iswara Swami,\netc., are sitting with Sri Bhagavan.The photo was taken=\r\n on a rock behind\nVirupaksha Cave. He then added, =E2=80=9CKandaswami looks=\r\n like a weak and lean man\nin this photo. That is because he went away from =\r\nus for more than a month\nand was doing tapas at Ezhu Sunai (Seven Springs) =\r\nand was purposely\nunderfeeding himself. Before that,he was a muscular, well=\r\n-built man.\n\nKandaswami=E2=80=99s humble offering to Sri Bhagavan,Skandasra=\r\nmam is still looked\nafter by Ramanasramam and is a place of pilgrimage for =\r\nthe devotees of Sri\nBhagavan.\n\nSources:\n\n1) Arunachala&#39;s Ramana Volume 1 Bo=\r\nok\n2)\nhttp://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_July_200=\r\n9.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=\r\n=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=\r\n=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1b3e6da2969047d302f11\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Kandaswami was the devotee who single handedly raised an Asramam for Sri=\r\n Bhagavan on the south-eastern slopes of Arunachala.
