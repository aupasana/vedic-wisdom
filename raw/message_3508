How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the exp=\r\nerience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personal=\r\nity is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sa=\r\ndhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises =\r\nno difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to =\r\nhappen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be=\r\n bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; devatas make the perso=\r\nn care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised =\r\nand the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=\r\n=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is al=\r\nl a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as =\r\nPrachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be=\r\n that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of th=\r\ne body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; origin=\r\nally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; being=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the he=\r\nads\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detrimen=\r\nt(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; som=\r\nebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left=\r\n, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on t=\r\nhe sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If peop=\r\nle persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then=\r\n there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then t=\r\nheir minds and intellects will not be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; the b=\r\nody and so their actions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black =\r\nmagic. These people usually join the same spirits which they have\n&gt; &gt; been =\r\nusing after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if some=\r\nbody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this bir=\r\nth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after=\r\n a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On th=\r\ne other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel =\r\nthat the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; ache=\r\nive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in th=\r\ne eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined,=\r\n then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=\r\n=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) eve=\r\nry day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same =\r\nmaterials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count=\r\n on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on se=\r\nx(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, g=\r\nrow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels a=\r\nre empty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this w=\r\nhole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before a=\r\nnd after.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short,=\r\n so do some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is ph=\r\nysically\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which=\r\n were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nYou may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat this is suitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The INTERNET now has a personality.
