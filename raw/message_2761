My comments =\r\non that is:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has n=\r\no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; Reason=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal =\r\nand derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, =\r\nand not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hy=\r\npnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the=\r\n astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the sen=\r\nses.\n&gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas =\r\n(sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, M=\r\nanas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Bud=\r\ndhi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individuali=\r\nzed consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of =\r\ncourse, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! =\r\nIf someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offen=\r\nded or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel e=\r\nlated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise=\r\n, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is=\r\n being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to p=\r\natting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still thi=\r\nnk &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these exa=\r\nmples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten total=\r\nly about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as=\r\n &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;s=\r\nee&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happen=\r\ning to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, t=\r\nhere is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara=\r\n or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limite=\r\nd to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends b=\r\neyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agn=\r\ni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is=\r\n incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and t=\r\nhis is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everythi=\r\nng he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized con=\r\nsciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; f=\r\nor some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ di=\r\nscriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (s=\r\nensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karme=\r\nndriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi dete=\r\nrmined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up=\r\n typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the=\r\n whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and cond=\r\nitioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are al=\r\nl different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different r=\r\noles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those int=\r\neractions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the=\r\n terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understanding is =\r\nflawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara natura=\r\nlly belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome =\r\nonly in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (t=\r\nhose without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of A=\r\nhamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and bud=\r\ndhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sens=\r\ne of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers o=\r\nf one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you rea=\r\nd this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ne=\r\nss attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived throug=\r\nh the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the=\r\n individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that=\r\n), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other i=\r\ndeas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. =\r\nThus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, d=\r\noesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is =\r\nindependent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - oth=\r\nerwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or A=\r\nhamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essen=\r\ntially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not=\r\n related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the ap=\r\nplication of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi be=\r\ning two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not =\r\n&quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very c=\r\nlear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying=\r\n Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the=\r\n entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, =\r\nas most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmose=\r\ns, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied b=\r\neings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. =\r\nThus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness f=\r\nor a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral=\r\n/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense-=\r\n consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness =\r\nas the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is w=\r\nhy it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and rein=\r\ncarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, wit=\r\nh their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their =\r\nphysical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni=\r\n digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that =\r\nwould require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that on=\r\ne is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas ar=\r\ne, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influenc=\r\ne the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on th=\r\ne other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act o=\r\nut their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas=\r\n, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or=\r\n I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and rema=\r\nin till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yuk=\r\nteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matri=\r\nx of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas,=\r\n Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 funct=\r\nions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elem=\r\nents).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a=\r\n whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a t=\r\nime, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the correspon=\r\nding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping=\r\n out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other =\r\nmodifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is fin=\r\nally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus,=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man=\r\nas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle=\r\n Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be =\r\ndeveloped or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Mood=\r\nha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on=\r\n...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does s=\r\ntore the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, being =\r\nconstituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon=\r\n (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable=\r\n liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vi=\r\nkalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta it=\r\nself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther t=\r\nattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t ge=\r\nt conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta=\r\n calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, =\r\nthe intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct =\r\nfrom Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brah=\r\nman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigad=\r\narshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of th=\r\ne seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of =\r\nAhamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like=\r\n eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi).=\r\n.. the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doe=\r\nsn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought t=\r\no sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out wh=\r\nile the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activiti=\r\nes or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the con=\r\ntroller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, through V=\r\nairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illu=\r\nstrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the plea=\r\nsing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Caus=\r\nal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associa=\r\nted with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentio=\r\nned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishn=\r\nasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which come=\r\ns to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen or hea=\r\nrd, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda =\r\nhas commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nis is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body a=\r\nnd working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah=\r\n -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yog=\r\na&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consci=\r\nousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a c=\r\nausal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For examp=\r\nle, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body,=\r\n but extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides i=\r\nn the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, c=\r\nhitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are p=\r\narts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sens=\r\nory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking=\r\n mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta (rememberin=\r\ng or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously =\r\nstored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense=\r\n of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousne=\r\nss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down=\r\n the individualized consciousness into various groups by functionality, lik=\r\ne five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karme=\r\nndriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-nes=\r\ns is the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to different people=\r\n, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and discriminatio=\r\nn.

One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperis=\r\nhable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things=\r\n that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning =\r\nand end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and=\r\n, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self.
