This particular Chaturthi comes when Moon is in Virgo, a raasi owned by Mercury again. In fact, it is Mercury&#39;s favorite raasi. Thus, this day has a strong influence of Mercury owning the earthy element.\n \nMooladhara chakra shows earthy element and Ganesha rules over it.\n \nMother cooking 21 types of delicious foods is symbolic of duality giving good results corresponding to 12 rasis and 9 planets to one in the physical plane. Ganesha rules over Mooladhara chakra, which represents the physical plane.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- shankar_mamta &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesh Chaturthi is two days away. Why is it celebrated on the 4th day of bhadrabada shukla paksha? Ever since i started doing homam to shri ganesh there is a keenness to know more and more about him.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is an interesting story about him that i would like to share in the cut and paste style. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There is also a story behind the symbolic snake, rat and the singular tusk. During one of his birthdays, His mother, Parvati, cooked for him twenty-one types of delicious food and a lot of sweet porridge. Ganesha ate so much that even his big belly could not contain it. Mounting his little mouse, he embarked on his nightly rounds. His mouse suddenly stumbled upon seeing a huge snake. To adjust His belly, Ganesha put the snake on as a belt around his stomach. All of a sudden, he heard laughter emanating form the sky.\n&gt; \n&gt;    He looked up and saw the moon mocking him. Ganesha infuriated, broke off one of his tusks and hurled it at the moon. Parvati, seeing this, immediately cursed the moon that whoever looks at it on Ganesh Chaturthi will be accused of a wrong doing. The symbology behind the mouse and snake and Ganesha&#39;s big belly and its relationship to the moon on his birthday is highly philosophic. The whole cosmos is known to be the belly of Ganesha. Parvati is the primordial energy. The seven realms above, seven realms below and seven oceans, are inside the cosmic belly of Ganesha, held together by the cosmic energy (kundalini ) symbolized as a huge snake which Ganesha ties around Him. The mouse is nothing but our ego. Ganesha, using the mouse as a vehicle, exemplifies the need to control our ego. One who has controlled the ego has Ganesha consciousness or God-consciousness.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, this is just a story. But then i got curious to know if there is actually a taboo abt. looking at the moon on this day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope we can all come closer to Ganesh consiousness....with time and sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards and best wishes\n\n\n"}}
