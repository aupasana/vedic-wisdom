Thank you. But I still\n&gt; confused as ever. The article seems to support Omkareshwar as one of the\n&gt; few, true Jyotirlingas.\n&gt;\n&gt; The crux of my question: Does &quot;Om Namah Shivaya Namo Omkareshwaraya&quot; have\n&gt; any historical precedent or is it merely constructed from the knowledge of\n&gt; one parampara (right or wrong who am I to say)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Basically: Is it a tried and tested, true blue remedy?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some food for thought --\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ambaa-l/message/11834\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; bhavadIyaH,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;        ajit\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, Mar 5, 2009 at 4:59 PM, sbm_sharma &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaskar\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have been reading the posts regarding remedial measures both on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sohamsa\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as well as this site. Very interesting to say the least.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; You say that astrological knowledge has been lost/corrupted is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; imperfect\n&gt;&gt; &gt; etc..No doubt it is, especially in this day and age.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; My question to you then, if you have a moment; what do you think of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotirlinga Mantras as remedies (done sincerely), are these &quot;valid&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mantras\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or just something made up, based off of corrupted knowledge? Are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; jyotirlinga\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mantras discussed in any ancient literature and/or Mantra Mahodadhi?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I only ask out of sincere curiosity, not to instigate things further.
