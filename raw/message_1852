You can add ghee/coconut pieces any time, even if yo=\r\nu are not saying Swaha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Can i add ghee after i do purnahuti becaus=\r\ne then i will be sure that it will get burned , otherwise some pieces remai=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; Vijay: Yes. No problem. BTW, if any pieces are not burnt fully, do n=\r\not bother about them. It is alright. Imagine as if you were serving the gue=\r\nss with some sweets.

Leaving some does not mean your gues=\r\ns did not appreciate your gesture.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Does it matter how i keep =\r\nthat piece of coconut , which i kept in the kund for PURNAHUTI, i mean ,the=\r\n part6 thats cut upside or towards down. Hope this question is clear.\n&gt; &gt; V=\r\nijay: No, it does not matter. If you keep the dark color up, it burns longe=\r\nr easily.
