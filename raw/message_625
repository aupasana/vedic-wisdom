It is also possible that neither is \nThakur.\n\nBottomline is that it does not really matter!\n\nIf you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit from them. Beings \nlike Thakur are born out of free volition and out of compassion for other \nbeings. They are the playmates of the Mother and are reborn as a part of Her \nplan. They are born to show the path to others. However, there are many \npaths. In each life, they may take up a different mission and demonstrate \ndifferent paths to people through their teachings and deeds. If you like the \nteachings of such a being in a specific birth, due to some rina with the \npath taught in that birth, follow the teachings of that birth. Who else the \nsame being was in other births is not that relevant or useful.\n\nIf you are attracted to the teachings of any saint - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa \nor Shriram Sharma Acharya or Yogeshwar ji or Ramana Maharshi or Aurobindo or \nSrila Prabhupada or Akkalkot Maharaj or Sai Baba or Kabir or Samartha \nRamadas or Jnaneshwar Maharaj or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or Ramanujacharya or \nRaghavedra Swami or Gautama Buddha or Jesus Christ or whoever, follow the \nteachings of that saint and benefit from them. Other speculative things \nabout them may be interesting, but can turn out to be a mere distraction.\n\nFind the teachings and path that attracts you the most. Read the teachings. \nMore importantly, try to *walk* the path. Imbibe the teachings in your \nthinking and in your common sense. Your actions and thoughts should reflect \nthe teachings. Focus on the teachings of the saint, digest them fully and \nbase your thoughts and actions on them.\n\n*        *        *\n\nRegarding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. The extent to which he \nimbibed the upanishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actions, the depth of \nhis sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolute lack of personal ego \nin him are the real miracles to me. Other miracles are useful to instill \nfaith and confidence in some people. But they do not do justice to his \npersonality. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very conscious of possibly \nlimiting Thakur&#39;s personality to a bunch of miracles and was concerned if \nbooks on him would be able to do justice to his personality.\n\nIf Ramakrishna Paramahamsa tranformed a bunch of youngsters into spiritual \ngiants who affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila Prabhupada \ntransformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who changed the world, \nit was possible because of their *total* surrender to the Lord and the \nzeroness of their personal ego. *That* is a true miracle.\n\nI do not want to downplay the discussion of other tangible miracles. But I \ndo not want people to lose track of the crux of the matter.\n\nRamakrishna could do miracles because he had no ego and surrendered fully to \nHer. *She* did everything for him.\n\nAs I said earlier, a person with normal ego can do some things; a person \nwith very little personal ego can do tremendous things; and, a person with \n*no* personal ego can do *any* thing. Our goal should be to eradicate \npersonal ego through constant vigilance and total surrender.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n\n\nNamaste,\n\none Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma\nAcharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.\n\nAnother as intresting as well as equally confusing thing is that\nLate Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about\nhis past life and he also indirectly indicated in his biography that\nhe was Thakur Ramkrishna in the previous birth.\n\nYours,\n\nUtpal\n\nI know\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Ashwinji\n&gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.\n&gt; I would like to mention something that may be an interesting\ninsight.\n&gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya. He actually said in his\n&gt; autobiography ( Hamari Virasat aur Vasiyat, My Inheritances and\nWill,\n&gt; loosely translated) that once when he was 14 years old and sitting\nfor\n&gt; his Morning Sandhya,  a divine figure appeared, guru\n&gt; Sarweshwaranandji. His Guru then made him realise his past lives\nand\n&gt; gave him the work for this life.\n&gt; He took him back as in a flash to the past. He realised that he had\n&gt; been born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and before that Guru\nof\n&gt; Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will try to locate the exact link and send it.The general site is\n&gt; www.awgp.org I remember the book is there on pdf in English\nsomewhere\n&gt; online. It&#39;s in the very first few chapters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Shiv\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my great Devine experience\n&gt; about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable experience that I\n&gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing\nexactly\n&gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of\n1973/74.\n&gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near\nDwarka.\n&gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance\nfor\n&gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; office and due to same Dep�?Tt; I had friendship with some\nTelephone\n&gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of� � � shri\n&gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking\nabout\n&gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly\ngathering at\n&gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created\nby\n&gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly\nmeeting\n&gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n�?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\nson\n&gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now�?�. -\n-\n&gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.\n&gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane\ncrash\n&gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about\nhim.\n&gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\nhe\n&gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\npunctured\n&gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super\npower\n&gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n&gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\nmyself\n&gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel�?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed\nhim\n&gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his\ngrace.\n&gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\nwaking\n&gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have\n&gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and\nshe\n&gt; argued with me a lot. �?&quot;�?oWhy should you take such a hasty\ndecision?\n&gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He\nwas a\n&gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us,\ngive\n&gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma\nAcharya\n&gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra�?�--.\n&gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not\nknow\n&gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to\n&gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that �?&quot;�?oSee, Mr. Patel\nhas\n&gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never\nasked\n&gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\nwithin\n&gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is\n&gt; perfect?�?�--\n&gt; &gt; She laughed at me�?&quot;�?oHow it is possible? I don�?Tt believe.�?�-\n-\n&gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; decision and convince my wife. �?~I want to test your existence\neven\n&gt; today.�?T\n&gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\n&gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; �?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n&gt; pulled my blanket and told me that-�?o Go to your friend�?Ts\nhouse. He\n&gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his\nhouse�?�\n&gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way\nto\n&gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are\ndisturbing\n&gt; him in such an early morning for such a silly things?�?T\n&gt; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that\n&gt; Morning.\n&gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.\nThere\n&gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will\nwrite\n&gt; it sometime.\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the\n&gt; earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to\n&gt; exaggerate.� May Shri Thakur bless all of us.\n&gt; &gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
