Catholicity c=\r\nonsists not in claiming that all people should give up\ntheir own faiths and=\r\n embrace one=E2=80=99s own, but in recognising that all\nreligions are paths=\r\n to God. The advaitins are expected to understand this.\n\nThen the dictum of=\r\n the great poet, Kalidasa, on this point, is quoted.\n\n234 =E2=80=98There is=\r\n only one God form; (but) It became divided into three; and\ncommon to all t=\r\nhe three is superiority and inferiority [by turns].=E2=80=99\n\nAmong them, t=\r\nhere is no real superiority, nor inferiority. But superiority\nor inferiorit=\r\ny is allowed to be ascribed to them by devotees, to suit their\nneeds. They =\r\nare all equally forms of the formless Brahman, the real Self.\nThese forms d=\r\nisappear when the real Self is experienced as it really is.\n\nWhich, of all =\r\navailable forms, is the best, is the next question, which is\nanswered next.=\r\n\n\n235 Of all the forms of God, the best is the sage, who does not consider\n=\r\nHimself as other than the Self. Indeed the sage, who is the Guru, is the\nse=\r\ncond of the [three] forms of divine grace.\n\n236 Bhagavan Sri Krishna himsel=\r\nf says in the Gita: =E2=80=98I myself am the sage.=E2=80=99\nTherefore to kn=\r\now this truth of him, as stated in the sacred lore, one\nshould regard the s=\r\nage as not different from God.\n\n237 [Also] there is the text of the Upanish=\r\nads, that one who wants\ndeliverance must worship the knower of the Self. If=\r\n he thinks of him [the\nsage, who is the Guru] as other than God, that thoug=\r\nht will obstruct his\npath.\n\nOne of the prominent defects of devotees who re=\r\ngard God as other than the\nSelf is next noticed.\n\n238 Those devotees who wo=\r\nrship God as not the Self are wanting in\ncatholicity. In the case of a few =\r\nof them, this defect ceases after a long\ntime by a clarification of the int=\r\nellect.\n\nNarrowness of mind is a serious defect, and till it is overcome, t=\r\nhe\naspirant will not reach his goal.\n\nThe next topic is =E2=80=98God-vision=\r\n=E2=80=99, on which some ignorance prevails.\n\n239 The devotee yearns to see=\r\n the form of God as conceived by himself.\nSometimes he may even see that ve=\r\nry form, but this vision is transitory and\nhence unreal.\n\nThe absurdity of =\r\nthis desire is now shown up.\n\n240 Being himself that very Supreme Being, bu=\r\nt regarding Him as other than\nthe Self through ignorance, he strives throug=\r\nh devotion to obtain a vision\nof Him! Is there anything more surprising tha=\r\nn this?\n\nIndeed this is topsy-turveydom!\n\n241 How can the seeing of a form =\r\nof the formless one be a true vision? And\nhow can the vision as not-self, o=\r\nf Him that is the Self, be a true vision?\n\nBhagavan unties this riddle with=\r\n ease.\n\n242 All form is mental, and hence the form of the spectacle is insi=\r\nde the\nspectator. It is the truth of the seer that should be sought, since =\r\nthat is\nthe truth of the Supreme Being.\n\nThe unreality of these visions is =\r\ndeclared next.\n\n243 =E2=80=98The man who, by the practice of devotion, sees=\r\n God as someone other\nthan himself, sees only a mental form=E2=80=99 =E2=80=\r\n=93 such is the utterance of the most\nholy one [on this point].\n\nWhat then =\r\nis the reality of God?\n\n244 That which remains over on the annihilation of =\r\nthe [would-be] seer, by\nthe quest [for the truth of] the seer, is itself th=\r\ne truth of the Self and\nalso the truth of the Supreme Being.\n\nHere, the que=\r\nst of the Self, the direct path taught by Bhagavan, is referred\nto. It will=\r\n be dealt with later.\n\nThe real vision is the same.\n\n245 That state, in whi=\r\nch the mind, called the soul, is swallowed up and has\nbecome one with Him i=\r\ns itself both the true vision of the Self, and the\nright vision of God =E2=\r\n=80=93 so says the holy Guru, Sri Ramana.\n\nThe next question is about how t=\r\no meditate on God.\n\n246 Revelation prescribes that the aspirant should medi=\r\ntate on Him as one=E2=80=99s\nown real Self. The revelation styles as beasts=\r\n those who meditate on Him as\nnot-the-Self.\n\n247 Bhagavan Vasishta has said=\r\n that he who worships God as not-Self, turning\naway from the real God who i=\r\ns the Self, is like one who goes about seeking a\nprecious stone, throwing a=\r\nway the gem named Kaustubha already in his hand!\n\nThis is a quotation from =\r\nthe Yoga Vasishtam. The same subject is dealt with\nfrom another point of vi=\r\new.\n\n248 Since the most holy one has shown that the original sin [spoken of=\r\n by\nChristians] is just the sense of =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, the s=\r\nense of being\nseparate from God, which is the outcome of this sin, is itsel=\r\nf only sinful!\n\n249 The completeness [allness] of the Supreme Being, assert=\r\ned by revelation,\nbecomes true only by His being the Self. The deluded ones=\r\n are just denying\nthis completeness of His by their notion of being separat=\r\ne from themselves.\n\n250 But devotion practised without a sense of differenc=\r\ne is the way of\naccepting this completeness of God; and Bhagavan, our Guru,=\r\n says that this\ndevotion is most excellent and highly purifying for the asp=\r\nirant for\ndeliverance.\n\nBhagavan also shows that devotion with sense of dif=\r\nference does not lead to\nthe goal.\n\n251 Also, the most holy one has shown t=\r\nhat, like the man who pursues\ndarkness, light in hand, the devotee who medi=\r\ntates on God as separate does\nnot reach God [so long as he has this false n=\r\notion].\n\nThe light in the hand is the real Self, and the darkness is the\nno=\r\nn-existent, separate God. This is said by Bhagavan in the Arunachala\nAshtak=\r\nam.\n\nThe superior devotion, on the other hand, leads to the goal, which is =\r\nthe\negoless state.\n\n252 Since the better devotee approaches God as the Self=\r\n, knowing that the\nnotion of difference, due to the ego, is false, for this=\r\n aspirant for\ndeliverance, the annihilation of the ego will be accomplished=\r\n quickly.\n\nAnother point is this.\n\n253 In the case of him who adores God as=\r\n non-Self, the surrender of himself\nis a sham, just like the gift of a coco=\r\nnut [to a guest] is a sham in the\nChola region.\nThe analogy given here is t=\r\nhe custom of placing a coconut on a plate, just\nfor form=E2=80=99s sake, wi=\r\nthout intending to give it.\n\nAnother consequence of the sense of difference=\r\n is next noted.\n\n254 When the Supreme Being is reduced to the status of non=\r\n-Self, the result\nis that He is not the most beloved of all. For according =\r\nto both revelation\nand the common experience of all creatures, the Self is =\r\nthe dearest of all!\n\nThe concluding verse of the teaching in the Gita is a =\r\nriddle. How Bhagavan,\nour Master, solved this riddle is shown next.\n\n255 Bh=\r\nagavan, our Guru, declared the secret of the correct meaning of the\nlast ve=\r\nrse of the Gita in the following way: =E2=80=98One should make surrender of=\r\n\noneself to the supreme one by giving up the attributes falsely ascribed to=\r\n\nthe real Self, namely that one is a =E2=80=9Csoul=E2=80=9D and so on.=E2=\r\n=80=99\n\nThe word dharma in that verse of the Gita must not be taken as mean=\r\ning\nrighteous action, but as meaning =E2=80=98status=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98q=\r\nuality=E2=80=99. Thus interpreted,\nthe verse makes good sense, not otherwis=\r\ne.\n\nThis brings us to the topic of self-surrender, which is now explained.\n=\r\n\n256 What is called surrender of oneself to God is the final consummation o=\r\nf\nthe practice of devotion. This can be achieved by the purified mind when =\r\nthe\nmight of the ego is greatly reduced.\n\n257 Just as a small magnet become=\r\ns united to a big one by the juxtaposition\nof the opposite poles, so the fi=\r\nnite soul becomes one with the Supreme Being\nby the conjunction of its head=\r\n with His feet.\n\nThis simile of the magnet serves to bring out the need of =\r\nperfect humility\nof the devotee. If the ego is rampant, there can be no sel=\r\nf-surrender.\n\nHow the one that has surrendered himself to God must get thro=\r\nugh life until\nhe attains perfect egolessness is described next.\n\nSource: h=\r\nttp://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae199ff7049fbfe70c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n231 =E2=80=98If a man adores God, who is nameless and formless, =\r\nhe will be liberated from the bondage due to names and forms.=E2=80=99 Such=\r\n is the teaching of Sri Ramana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also the following.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;232 The m=\r\nan who, being endowed with the divine temperament, meditates with devotion =\r\non God with a form, will attain that same State [of deliverance] that one a=\r\nttains by meditating on Him as formless.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The next verse shows that=\r\n the devotee is free, for purposes of his devotion, to ascribe to God any n=\r\name or form that appeals to himself as lovable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;233 One may adore th=\r\nat one Being by name and in any form, as one likes. Among the forms of the =\r\nsupreme one, the wise one, whose mind is pure, will not see any superiority=\r\n or inferiority.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus true catholicity is the distinguishing featu=\r\nre of the teaching of Vedanta. Catholicity consists not in claiming that al=\r\nl people should give up their own faiths and embrace one=E2=80=99s own, but=\r\n in recognising that all religions are paths to God. The advaitins are expe=\r\ncted to understand this.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Then the dictum of the great poet, Kalida=\r\nsa, on this point, is quoted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;234 =E2=80=98There is only one God for=\r\nm; (but) It became divided into three; and common to all the three is super=\r\niority and inferiority [by turns].=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Among them, there is n=\r\no real superiority, nor inferiority. But superiority or inferiority is allo=\r\nwed to be ascribed to them by devotees, to suit their needs. They are all e=\r\nqually forms of the formless Brahman, the real Self. These forms disappear =\r\nwhen the real Self is experienced as it really is.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Which, of all a=\r\nvailable forms, is the best, is the next question, which is answered next.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;235 Of all the forms of God, the best is the sage, who does not cons=\r\nider Himself as other than the Self. Indeed the sage, who is the Guru, is t=\r\nhe second of the [three] forms of divine grace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;236 Bhagavan Sri K=\r\nrishna himself says in the Gita: =E2=80=98I myself am the sage.=E2=80=99 Th=\r\nerefore to know this truth of him, as stated in the sacred lore, one should=\r\n regard the sage as not different from God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;237 [Also] there is the =\r\ntext of the Upanishads, that one who wants deliverance must worship the kno=\r\nwer of the Self. If he thinks of him [the sage, who is the Guru] as other t=\r\nhan God, that thought will obstruct his path.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One of the prominent=\r\n defects of devotees who regard God as other than the Self is next noticed.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;238 Those devotees who worship God as not the Self are wanting in c=\r\natholicity. In the case of a few of them, this defect ceases after a long t=\r\nime by a clarification of the intellect.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Narrowness of mind is a s=\r\nerious defect, and till it is overcome, the aspirant will not reach his goa=\r\nl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next topic is =E2=80=98God-vision=E2=80=99, on which some ign=\r\norance prevails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;239 The devotee yearns to see the form of God as co=\r\nnceived by himself. Sometimes he may even see that very form, but this visi=\r\non is transitory and hence unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The absurdity of this desire is=\r\n now shown up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;240 Being himself th=\r\nat very Supreme Being, but regarding Him as other than the Self through ign=\r\norance, he strives through devotion to obtain a vision of Him! Is there any=\r\nthing more surprising than this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Indeed this is topsy-turve=\r\nydom!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;241 How can the seeing of a form of the formless one be a true=\r\n vision? And how can the vision as not-self, of Him that is the Self, be a =\r\ntrue vision?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan unties this riddle with ease.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;242 All=\r\n form is mental, and hence the form of the spectacle is inside the spectato=\r\nr. It is the truth of the seer that should be sought, since that is the tru=\r\nth of the Supreme Being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unreality of these visions is declared =\r\nnext.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;243 =E2=80=98The man who, by the practice of devotion, sees =\r\nGod as someone other than himself, sees only a mental form=E2=80=99 =E2=80=\r\n=93 such is the utterance of the most holy one [on this point].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What=\r\n then is the reality of God?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;244 That which remains over on the an=\r\nnihilation of the [would-be] seer, by the quest [for the truth of] the seer=\r\n, is itself the truth of the Self and also the truth of the Supreme Being.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, the quest of the Self, the direct path taught by Bhagavan, is =\r\nreferred to. It will be dealt with later.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The real vision is the s=\r\name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;245 That state, in which the m=\r\nind, called the soul, is swallowed up and has become one with Him is itself=\r\n both the true vision of the Self, and the right vision of God =E2=80=93 so=\r\n says the holy Guru, Sri Ramana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The next question is about=\r\n how to meditate on God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;246 Revelation prescribes that the aspirant=\r\n should meditate on Him as one=E2=80=99s own real Self. The revelation styl=\r\nes as beasts those who meditate on Him as not-the-Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;247 Bhagav=\r\nan Vasishta has said that he who worships God as not-Self, turning away fro=\r\nm the real God who is the Self, is like one who goes about seeking a precio=\r\nus stone, throwing away the gem named Kaustubha already in his hand!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;This is a quotation from the Yoga Vasishtam. The same subject is dealt w=\r\nith from another point of view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;248 Since the most holy one has show=\r\nn that the original sin [spoken of by Christians] is just the sense of =E2=\r\n=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, the sense of being separate from God, which i=\r\ns the outcome of this sin, is itself only sinful!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;249 The complete=\r\nness [allness] of the Supreme Being, asserted by revelation, becomes true o=\r\nnly by His being the Self. The deluded ones are just denying this completen=\r\ness of His by their notion of being separate from themselves.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;250 =\r\nBut devotion practised without a sense of difference is the way of acceptin=\r\ng this completeness of God; and Bhagavan, our Guru, says that this devotion=\r\n is most excellent and highly purifying for the aspirant for deliverance.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan also shows that devotion with sense of difference does not=\r\n lead to the goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;251 Also, the most holy one has shown that, like =\r\nthe man who pursues darkness, light in hand, the devotee who meditates on G=\r\nod as separate does not reach God [so long as he has this false notion].&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The light in the hand is the real Self, and the darkness is the non-=\r\nexistent, separate God. This is said by Bhagavan in the Arunachala Ashtakam=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The superior devotion, on the other hand, leads to the goal, which=\r\n is the egoless state.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;252 Since the better devotee approaches God=\r\n as the Self, knowing that the notion of difference, due to the ego, is fal=\r\nse, for this aspirant for deliverance, the annihilation of the ego will be =\r\naccomplished quickly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Another point is this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;253 In the cas=\r\ne of him who adores God as non-Self, the surrender of himself is a sham, ju=\r\nst like the gift of a coconut [to a guest] is a sham in the Chola region.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;The analogy given here is the custom of placing a coconut on a plate, jus=\r\nt for form=E2=80=99s sake, without intending to give it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Another c=\r\nonsequence of the sense of difference is next noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;254 When the Su=\r\npreme Being is reduced to the status of non-Self, the result is that He is =\r\nnot the most beloved of all. For according to both revelation and the commo=\r\nn experience of all creatures, the Self is the dearest of all!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The=\r\n concluding verse of the teaching in the Gita is a riddle. How Bhagavan, ou=\r\nr Master, solved this riddle is shown next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;255 Bhagavan, our Guru, =\r\ndeclared the secret of the correct meaning of the last verse of the Gita in=\r\n the following way: =E2=80=98One should make surrender of oneself to the su=\r\npreme one by giving up the attributes falsely ascribed to the real Self, na=\r\nmely that one is a =E2=80=9Csoul=E2=80=9D and so on.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The =\r\nword dharma in that verse of the Gita must not be taken as meaning righteou=\r\ns action, but as meaning =E2=80=98status=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98quality=E2=80=\r\n=99. Thus interpreted, the verse makes good sense, not otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\nis brings us to the topic of self-surrender, which is now explained.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;256 What is called surrender of oneself to God is the final consummation=\r\n of the practice of devotion. This can be achieved by the purified mind whe=\r\nn the might of the ego is greatly reduced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;257 Just as a small magnet becomes united to a big one by the juxta=\r\nposition of the opposite poles, so the finite soul becomes one with the Sup=\r\nreme Being by the conjunction of its head with His feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\nis simile of the magnet serves to bring out the need of perfect humility of=\r\n the devotee. If the ego is rampant, there can be no self-surrender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;How the one that has surrendered himself to God must get through life unti=\r\nl he attains perfect egolessness is described next.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rte=\r\nach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rp=\r\nv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;m=\r\nargin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px=\r\n;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-=\r\n- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae199ff7049fbfe70c--\r\n\n"}}
