If you know a specific \ncombination of syllables and repeat it, will things happen magically? The \nanswer is both yes and no. I will explain this using a simple analogy.\n\nSuppose a king is giving away expensive gifts at some place and you are \ninterested in going there and getting a gift. Suppose someone gave you some \ndirections to go to that place. Suppose the directions are complicated. Now, \ngetting directions to that place is not the same as getting a gift. You have \nto walk carefully, resolve confusions in the way, overcome obstacles and \nreach the place. If you finally reach the place, then you will receive the \ngift from king. If you get confused or get lost or give up, you will not get \nthe gift. If someone who has gone there before gives you directions to the \nplace (as opposed to someone who has never gone to that place and only heard\nthe directions from someone else), it is helpful as such a person may give \nclearer guidance in potentially confusing areas. But, still it is possible \nto get lost on the way. Especially, one who is not smart enough or strong \nenough to overcome the obstacles on the way may not reach the place even if \ngiven directions.\n\nIn the analogy, experiencing a mantra is like the place where king is giving \naway gifts. God is like the king. The result of the mantra is like the gift. \nThe letters/words of the mantra and other details of its sadhana are like \nthe directions to the place. Just as somebody who wrote down directions to a \nplace is not guaranteed to reach that place successfully, one who knows a \nmantra is not guaranteed to experience it and get its results. One who has \nweaknesses is less likely to succeed.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf one got a mantra from a guru and repeated it a few times and got a \nresult, that must be because (1) the person is already quite pure, has a \nrina with that mantra and ready for the results of the mantra or (2) he \nderived from the shakti accumulated by his guru with that mantra (kind of \nlike a person who gave directions to a place also giving you an intelligent \nvehicle that was driven by him before, which remembers the way and can take \nyou there easily).\n\nIn general, please realize that getting the result of any mantra requires \nsome purity and some sadhana. Nothing comes free. At the same time, no \neffort is wasted.\n\n*        *        *\n\nFor now, I am afraid most people will have to carry matchsticks or atleast \nstones that can generate sparks, if they want to start fire for a homam. \nWhat Vimalananda said will not work right away, even if you know the exact \nletters of the mantra that he chanted.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &lt;d.selvam@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 22, 2009 12:35 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: vishnu sudarshana mantra\n\n\n&gt; my purpose to light the homa without matchstick when iam doing homa alone\n&gt; thanks\n&gt; D.Selvam\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Swee Chan&quot; &lt;swee@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jaya Jagannatha\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear D.
