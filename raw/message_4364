I do the homa=\r\n on the balcony of my house and was intially only concerned about dust fall=\r\ning into the fire. I use an room divider as protection against strong gusts=\r\n of wind and dust. \n\nIt is just my personal experience that homa done outsi=\r\nde somehow feels much more stronger and peaceful and also I get to enjoy a =\r\nmuch bigger fire . When I used to do it inside always used to be concerned =\r\nabout the smoke alarm going off and instead of focussing on the homa used t=\r\no be focussed on managing a smaller fire with coconut pieces.\n\nAlso it give=\r\ns me happiness in thinking am able to serve Lord ganapati with much more of=\r\nferings in a big fire outside.\n\nmy two cents.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore=\r\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Generally doing homa with copras produce least =\r\nsmoke.
