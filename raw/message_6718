Others may have the same questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Sound is nothi=\r\nng but vibration. When vibrating vocal cards make air \n&gt; particles vibrate,=\r\n that vibration reaches the ear drums of people. \n&gt; However, it is not just=\r\n gross matter that vibrates. With every thought, \n&gt; mind vibrates too. Vibr=\r\nations in subtle matter around us are more \n&gt; powerful than vibrations in g=\r\nross matter around us.\n&gt; \n&gt; The intentions and attitude are an important fa=\r\nctor in deciding the \n&gt; quality of vibrations at the subtle level. Subtle l=\r\nevel is definitely \n&gt; more important than gross level.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Normally, we=\r\n make offering with palm facing up. Palm facing up is a \n&gt; symbol of asking=\r\n and palm facing down is a symbol of commanding. When we \n&gt; make any offeri=\r\nng to any god in homam or to an idol or to any respected \n&gt; person, we make=\r\n it palm facing up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Making an offering, one can hold it between (1) th=\r\numb and index finger, \n&gt; (2) thumb and ring finger, (3) thumb and middle & =\r\nring fingers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thumb symbolizes ahamkara (sense of I). Ring, middle, in=\r\ndex and little \n&gt; fingers stand for dharma (duty/principles), artha (resour=\r\nces/work), \n&gt; kaama (motivation/desire) and moksha (detachment/liberation).=\r\n When we \n&gt; meditate or hold a mala or make offerings in homam, thumb (aham=\r\nkara) is \n&gt; associated with one or more of purusharthas. The most popular m=\r\nudra is \n&gt; tips of thumb and index finger touching each other. It increase =\r\n\n&gt; knowledge and detachment. Another popular mudra is thumb touching ring &=\r\n \n&gt; middle fingers. This is for dharmarhas, i.e. increase one&#39;s resources \n=\r\n&gt; and follow dharma. Some people also use only ring finger, i.e. follow \n&gt; =\r\ndharma. But using only middle finger is forbidden, i.e. why do you need \n&gt; =\r\nresources (money etc) if not to follow dharma?!\n&gt; \n&gt; When using a mala or h=\r\nolding a ghee spoon for making offerings in homam, \n&gt; some people keep the =\r\nindex finger away and use only the fingers. They \n&gt; believe that index fing=\r\ner should not be used. Well, index finger is the \n&gt; finger of liberation an=\r\nd knowledge. There is no need to avoid it, unless \n&gt; you are doing a ritual=\r\n for a very specific result.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Different materials have different pro=\r\nperties and cause different \n&gt; results. It is a good idea for people to rot=\r\nate and offer various things \n&gt; each.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. :-) There are already people =\r\nwhose consciousness has ascended to \n&gt; other dimensions. There were, are an=\r\nd will be such people. Don&#39;t look at \n&gt; 2012 as a bus that should not be mi=\r\nssed or something like that. In fact, \n&gt; 2012 has no real spiritual signifi=\r\ncance. It comes in the middle of a \n&gt; period of spiritual transformation on=\r\n earth. I see the years AFTER 2012 \n&gt; as being important, rather than 2012 =\r\nitself. Due to the mass hysteria \n&gt; that may develop in parts of human soci=\r\nety, aided by natural events, \n&gt; 2012 may indeed bring some big changes. Bu=\r\nt the real transformation will \n&gt; be afterwards. For example, I see 2015-20=\r\n20 as a very important time.\n&gt; \n&gt; The specifics are tough to know, but one =\r\nthing is certain. An unwise and \n&gt; selfish civilization swept most of earth=\r\n and was about to nearly destroy \n&gt; earth. It has been stopped. The foundat=\r\nion has been laid for the fall of \n&gt; this civilization and for the old ways=\r\n will return. People will be \n&gt; wiser, more selfless and will lead more dha=\r\nrmik and wholesome lives. \n&gt; Sadhana done by all of us will smooth out the =\r\ntransformation and speed \n&gt; things up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Forget about technicalities lik=\r\ne 5th dimension, ascension etc and just \n&gt; do sadhana. The key is to not wa=\r\nnt anything specifically, yet be able to \n&gt; do anything conscience tells us=\r\n one we need to do, and being able to \n&gt; accept any end result in the end.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. I do not know much about &quot;Shiva yoga&quot;. Yoga basically means oneness=\r\n. \n&gt; We essentially want to merge individual consciousness with cosmic \n&gt; c=\r\nonsciousness. There are many ways to do it. All are valid paths. Some \n&gt; ta=\r\nke longer, some take shorter, but all are valid. Each path has \n&gt; different=\r\n challenges and different advantages. One&#39;s own prior \n&gt; conditioning may m=\r\nake one like some paths and dislike some.\n&gt; \n&gt; Irrespective of which path o=\r\nne selects for yoga, one huge catalyst is \n&gt; the influence of sadguru. A sa=\r\ndguru who throws light on one&#39;s weaknesses \n&gt; and helps one overcome those,=\r\n will aid significantly, especially in the \n&gt; beginning. After one reaches =\r\nsome level, one&#39;s own conscience can act as \n&gt; one&#39;s guru and guide one wel=\r\nl. But, in the beginning, a sadguru helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many specific paths become =\r\npopular when an elevated person popularizes \n&gt; them and some people around =\r\nhim/her make brisk progress in that path. \n&gt; But, things slow down for the =\r\nnext generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; That is why, in order to en=\r\nsure a stream of seekers who make good \n&gt; progress over the next few centur=\r\nies, without depending on an external \n&gt; guru in flesh, we are popularizing=\r\n homam again. Agni is an energy form \n&gt; that you can see and touch physical=\r\nly. He is a living god on earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agni (Fire) is the original seer, ori=\r\nginal purohit, original priest and \n&gt; original guru. If one makes acquainta=\r\nnce with Agni, Agni takes care of \n&gt; one. Agni works on one&#39;s attitude, tra=\r\nnsforms one from inside, sharpens \n&gt; and strengthens one&#39;s conscioence and =\r\nhelps one make spiritual progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have a good guru, follow wha=\r\ntever path he/she shows you. If not, \n&gt; surrender to Agni. Agni will direct=\r\n you to your ishta devata. Narasimha, \n&gt; Manish etc will leave this earth s=\r\nooner or later. But Agni will be here \n&gt; in physical form to guide you fore=\r\nver. Many people will make progress \n&gt; using Fire, in the coming few centur=\r\nies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam a=\r\nnd Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;    =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter =\r\nID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 7/2/11, &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;      From: &lt;deleted=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;      Subject: Few Queries\n&gt;      To: pvr108@...\n&gt;      Date: Saturday, =\r\nJuly 2, 2011, 7:21 AM\n&gt; \n&gt;      Dear Mr.PVR,\n&gt;      Hi,I really enjoyed goi=\r\nng through you book online(vedic-wisdom),I \n&gt; had a few queries of my own,h=\r\nope to get enlightene:\n&gt;      1.Does Intention have more weight-age than In=\r\ntonation/correct \n&gt; pronounciation(we usually turn to god when nothing else=\r\n works and not \n&gt; all of us are good at Sanskrit) while doing havan/homam ?=\r\n\n&gt;      2.Should we hold the samagri in middle two fingers and offer it \n&gt; =\r\npalm facing downward or upwards?\n&gt;      3.What is difference between one wh=\r\no is offering ghee and one is \n&gt; offering samagri in havan...when a family =\r\nis doing havan together.\n&gt;      4.What are your views on Ascencion to 5th D=\r\nimension that we are \n&gt; hearing about in 2012?\n&gt;      5.And what about shiv=\r\n yog...the difference if any from reiki?\n&gt;      Hoping for your reply at ea=\r\nrliest..\n&gt;      Regards,\n&gt;      &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
