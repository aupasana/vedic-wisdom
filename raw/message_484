He was a Maharatrian Deshasth brahmin =\r\nby \n&gt; birth and was born in Gwailor district in MP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ranchod Dasji Maha=\r\nraj name was given to him by his disciples in \n&gt; Gujarat.\n&gt; \n&gt; He may have =\r\nlived for 700 plus years.\n&gt; \n&gt; He ran away from home at a very tender age a=\r\nnd was taken up a \n&gt; disciple by Bala Krishna Dasji also known as Paihari B=\r\naba.\n&gt; Paihari baba was also very releaized, he only drank milk and so the =\r\n\n&gt; name. Paihari Baba was Gujarati by birth but spoke in Hindi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paihar=\r\ni Baba lived in Kulu for a long time, than in Pushkar, he was \n&gt; in Pushkar=\r\n when the temple of Srinathji was moved from Mathura to \n&gt; Rajasthan. At th=\r\nat time he did a lot of seva of lord Krishna in \n&gt; Pushkar. \n&gt; After that h=\r\ne lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. \n&gt; Babaji also lived in Galtaj=\r\ni for about 12 years and he had the vision \n&gt; of Lord Rama in the same cave=\r\n, that exists today too.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is located a few miles from Jaipur, there =\r\nare a few temples there \n&gt; near the cave. I have visited this cave too.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; From Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and than to Kashmir where \n&gt; he=\r\n lived in a place called &quot;Rasayani Gufa&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paihari Baba also may have l=\r\nived for 500 plus years too.\n&gt; \n&gt; While at Galtaji, the Famous Tulsidas mah=\r\naraj had visited Paihari \n&gt; Baba and give a hand written manuscipt of Ramay=\r\nana.\n&gt; \n&gt; They belong to the Ramanandi Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and Godd=\r\ness \n&gt; Sita devi as ishta devata. Ramanandi Sampardaya came as an offshot o=\r\nf \n&gt; Ramanuja Sampradaya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji or Ranchod Dasji Maharaj lived for ma=\r\nny years in Bengal, \n&gt; Chitrakot and Also visited Gujarat. He also stayed i=\r\nn Kashmir.\n&gt; One of the kings of Kashmir was a devout disciple of Paihari B=\r\naba.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Babaji and Paihari Baba were adept in &quot;kaya kalpa&quot; and they =\r\nalso \n&gt; had strong connection with saints located in Tibet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paihari Ba=\r\nba used to remain in samadhi at a stretch for 2 to 3 years.\n&gt; Paihari Baba =\r\nas a young brahamchari served also Swami Ramananda in \n&gt; Kashi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rancho=\r\nddasji Maharaj has samadhi in Pushkar, A trust in Rajkot, \n&gt; Gujarat and al=\r\nso in Chitakut too. At these places they do charitable \n&gt; activities.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nRanchoddasji Maharaj had many disciples but he never made anybody his \n&gt; su=\r\ncessor.\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of books have been written by one or two lady disciples =\r\nof \n&gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj and all this information written here is coming =\r\n\n&gt; from those books. these books are avialable in his ashrams. They are \n&gt; =\r\nwritten in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.\n&gt; \n&gt; These books describe Ranchoddas=\r\nji Maharaj&#39;s teachings, his view on \n&gt; many things, his short speeches and =\r\nkind of like biography.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are very good books, they describe many =\r\naspects of spirtuality \n&gt; in simple laymans language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji indicated=\r\n that Lahiri Mahashaya was his disciple for 5 births\n&gt; and in this birth wi=\r\nth kriya yoga he cleared all his impressions and \n&gt; was given authority to =\r\nguide people and initiate in kriya yoga after \n&gt; relalizing his true nature=\r\n. Like him he had another disciple in \n&gt; Bengal too known as &quot;Din bandhu&quot; b=\r\nut I do not have any information on \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji did meet Shri Yutes=\r\nhwar Maharaj a few times.\n&gt; \n&gt; He also indicated that many advanced saints =\r\nfrom the Nath Sampradaya \n&gt; also took birth and followed the ramanandi samp=\r\nradaya to experiance \n&gt; more bliss.\n&gt; \n&gt; My intent here is to share informa=\r\ntion and not start any \n&gt; controversies.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone needs the names of =\r\nthese books and also the address of \n&gt; ashrams, I am very happy to provide =\r\nthat too.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is interest in more information than I shall try to=\r\n write \n&gt; more about the lineage and the prominent saints of the lineage to=\r\no.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have many pictures of Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but am not sure =\r\n\n&gt; how to load them up for you all to see.\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy Navratri\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
