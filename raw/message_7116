There is no void and no despair. 20.1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;For me, free from the sense of dualism, there a=\r\nre no scriptures, no self-knowledge, no mind free from an object, no satisf=\r\naction and no freedom from desire. 20.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There is no knowled=\r\nge or ignorance, no &quot;me,&quot; &quot;this,&quot; or &quot;mine,&quot; =\r\nno bondage, no liberation, and no property of self-nature. 20.3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For =\r\nhim who is always free from individual characteristics there is no antecede=\r\nnt causal action, no liberation during life, and no fulfilment at death. 20=\r\n.4&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;For me, free from individualit=\r\ny, there is no doer and no reaper of the consequences, no cessation of acti=\r\non, no arising of thought, no immediate object, and no idea of results. 20.=\r\n5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There is no world, no seeker for liberation, no yogi, no =\r\nseer, no one bound and no one liberated. I remain in my own nondual nature.=\r\n 20.6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no emanation or return, no goal, means, seeker or ach=\r\nievement. I remain in my own nondual nature. 20.7&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For me who am fo=\r\nrever unblemished, there is no assessor, no standard, nothing to assess, an=\r\nd no assessment. 20.8&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me who am forever actionless, there is no =\r\ndistraction or one-pointedness of mind, no lack of understanding, no stupid=\r\nity, no joy and no sorrow. 20.9&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For me who am always free from del=\r\niberations there is neither conventional truth nor absolute truth, no happi=\r\nness and no suffering. 20.10&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;For me=\r\n who am forever pure there is no illusion, no samsara, no attachment or det=\r\nachment, no living organism, and no God. 20.11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For me who a=\r\nm forever unmovable and indivisible, established in myself, there is no act=\r\nivity or inactivity, no liberation and no bondage. 20.12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me who =\r\nam blessed and without limitation, there is no initiation or scripture, no =\r\ndisciple or teacher, and no goal of human life. 20.13&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There is no =\r\nbeing or non-being, no unity or dualism. What more is there to say? There i=\r\ns nothing outside of me. 20.14&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sour=\r\nce&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-=\r\nleft:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 5=\r\n1);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margi=\r\nn-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--20cf300512523f80d904aac03cf0--\r\n\n"}}
