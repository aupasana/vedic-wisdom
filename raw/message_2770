Neither do I have time for repl=\r\nying to so many people around.\n\nPatanjali Sutras, cited by me in first mail=\r\n, have clearly stated what I am only trying to convey. Simply because it wa=\r\ns impossible for me to directly attempt to understand this subtle differenc=\r\ne, the writings of Sri Yukteswar helped bring the focus light on it. Only t=\r\nhe Sage like Patanjali could have put the subtle classification in place, b=\r\ny the exact term.\n\nChitta and not Ahamkara causes Yoga\nManas and not Ahamka=\r\nra is involved with Vairagya\nAsmita and not Ahamkara causes Jnana (Sasmita =\r\nsamadhi)\n\n&gt; Upanishadic terms wherein Ahamkara is the centering principle!\n=\r\n&gt; There is only one underlying centering principle, which creates an &gt; appa=\r\nrent sense of self in the manas, in the body and everywhere\n&gt; else you ment=\r\nion. Or do you disagree that at the root, there isnt\n&gt; only one causative c=\r\nentering principle?\n\nAhamkara is not real, it is only a term, not a Causati=\r\nve-principle on the same grounds as Manas, Chitta and Asmita! A term that i=\r\ns only a representative state of existence, which has been separated from t=\r\nhe true state of existence.\n\nUpanishads have not used Ahamkara as a centeri=\r\nng principle for the three bodies, but only as a representative of unnatura=\r\nl state of existence. It doesn&#39;t exist after the Self is realized because i=\r\nt is replaced by a constant focus on Souls&#39; I-ness.\n\nIf there were any real=\r\nity to Ahamkara, it wouldn&#39;t cease to exist!\n\n  However, these three center=\r\ns (Causal-body ideas) exist even after\nself-realization, in the three bodie=\r\ns, till the Sage leaves all the three jars - and create no further binding =\r\nKarma.\n\n  NOTE - I do not know the subtle details i.e. if Causal body gets =\r\ndestroyed, how does the Sage operate with just physical and astral bodies a=\r\nnd Chitta expanded in Causal Cosmos. So, am keeping it simple for now.\n\nNow=\r\n, they are in the states of Yoga, Vairagya and Jnana respectively. Thus, ev=\r\nen the Brahman realized beings take birth as Avataras, without Ahamkara, bu=\r\nt with the essential required centering principles of Asmita, Manas and Chi=\r\ntta (all fixed on brahman).\n\nWhile for an unenlightened person, these three=\r\n states don&#39;t exist, and the same centers become afflicted with a non-entit=\r\ny called Ahamkara (like darkness is a non-entity, it is not there but still=\r\n it exists till you switch-on the light).\n\nThis is all my understanding and=\r\n opinion as interpreted and understood from the sources I have mentioned.\n\n=\r\nWhat is so difficult in this that one cannot understand ?\nApart from the te=\r\nrminology, that caused the problem - the truth of the matter is that - if a=\r\n person doesn&#39;t want to understand something, nobody can make him understan=\r\nd.\n\nRegards,\nNitish\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostuden=\r\nt&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nitish,\n&gt; \n&gt; I would have loved to re=\r\nad each one of your replies, but unfortunately work pressures rise, and I a=\r\nm unable to spend the necessary time. But let me say some things clearly, I=\r\n think they may help you. It is probably true that you have had some signif=\r\nicant spiritual experiences, which is why you speak with authority. I have =\r\nno problem with that, and that is why I actually expect to find some wisdom=\r\n in your words. But see, the problem with spiritual experience is terminolo=\r\ngy, terminology, terminology. Ordinary sensory experiences are easily commu=\r\nnicated - it is easy to say the word &quot;tree&quot; and you know exactly what I mea=\r\nn - because trees are available everywhere in common sensory experience. Bu=\r\nt not so with spiritual experience, they are by definition outside common s=\r\nensory experience! So if you want to communicate your ideas (if you dont th=\r\nat&#39;s fine too), you will have to invest some significant time in coming to =\r\ncommon ground (with others) before ideas get exchanged for the benefit of a=\r\nll. \n&gt; \n&gt; I will take your current post as an example. I will try to explai=\r\nn my terminology as clearly as possible and you will then see that there is=\r\n some common ground between you and everyone else here: The essential point=\r\n in all our minds when we talk Ahamkara, ego etc is, in very loose essence,=\r\n a &quot;centering principle&quot;, right? It is that centering principle which eithe=\r\nr is, or leads to, the formation of an individuality, no? At every level of=\r\n existence, no? \n&gt; \n&gt; I think you will agree with the above. Now, from my u=\r\nnderstanding of what you write, when you say Ahamkara is the dominant I sen=\r\nse in the physical cosmos, Manas in astral cosmos and Chitta in the causal =\r\ncosmos, you are simply in essence trying to convey the fact that at differe=\r\nnce levels of existence the actual centers are different, which is probably=\r\n true. It is common experience that for all of us in everyday experience, w=\r\ne are not aware of our deeper senses of self (I am not using any loaded ter=\r\nms here, simply the loosely defined term &quot;self&quot;). Our senses of self are cl=\r\nearly body centered. \n&gt; \n&gt; So what you are trying to do, are at least what =\r\nI get from your writings, is to call that body centered sense of self Ahamk=\r\nara, right? Whereas everyone else on this forum is using the standard Upani=\r\nshadic terms wherein Ahamkara is the centering principle! There is only one=\r\n underlying centering principle, which creates an apparent sense of self in=\r\n the manas, in the body and everywhere else you mention. Or do you disagree=\r\n that at the root, there isnt only one causative centering principle?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI could do the above for the rest of your writings and probably reach commo=\r\nn ground, but it would take time which as I said I am suddenly at a shortag=\r\ne of. But it would be easier if you tried and understood the terms as every=\r\none uses them here, so the exchange of ideas and understanding would be muc=\r\nh quicker and without the conflict..\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yeeahoo_99&quot; &lt;nitish.arya@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha and Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Than=\r\nks for your feedback.

My comments on that is:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.  I-n=\r\ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control a=\r\nny other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt;    Reason:\n&gt; &gt;    Soul is the onl=\r\ny Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence=\r\n. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each =\r\nother. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is abl=\r\ne to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense =\r\nof I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt;    He has no=\r\n Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor min=\r\nd) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates =\r\nthe senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    I=\r\n hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized conscio=\r\nusness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it =\r\nis ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;=\r\ns idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone=\r\n says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if =\r\nsomeone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One=\r\n&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even tho=\r\nugh nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being use=\r\nd. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on =\r\nthe physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am b=\r\neing called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one=\r\n&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sup=\r\npose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about =\r\nthe physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In =\r\ndreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onsel=\r\nf, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;m=\r\ne&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is s=\r\ntill a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-nes=\r\ns or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to phy=\r\nsical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond th=\r\ne physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do no=\r\nt have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorr=\r\nect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is =\r\nwhat I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he d=\r\noes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized conscious=\r\nness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for som=\r\ne of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/discrimin=\r\nating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-=\r\nmotor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas=\r\n (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined =\r\nwhat to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole=\r\n&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioni=\r\nng, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all diff=\r\nerent parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles w=\r\nhile interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interacti=\r\nons may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Am not mixing up the t=\r\nerminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understanding is flawed=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally be=\r\nlong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only i=\r\nn the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those w=\r\nithout a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkar=\r\na like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi al=\r\nso. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I=\r\n-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;=\r\ns individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this=\r\n up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness =\r\nattributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through t=\r\nhe idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the in=\r\ndividuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), =\r\nwhile it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other idea=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to =\r\nthe idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. T=\r\nhus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, do=\r\nesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is i=\r\nndependent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - othe=\r\nrwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ah=\r\namkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Esse=\r\nntially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are no=\r\nt related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the a=\r\npplication of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi b=\r\neing two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not=\r\n &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very =\r\nclear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carryin=\r\ng Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basis of th=\r\ne entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well,=\r\n as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmos=\r\nes, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied =\r\nbeings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities.=\r\n Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness =\r\nfor a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astra=\r\nl/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sen=\r\nse-consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousne=\r\nss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive-consciousne=\r\nss as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\nHowever, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which=\r\n is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and=\r\n reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   As an example, Devat=\r\nas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all=\r\n their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhar=\r\na, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkar=\r\na that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or =\r\nthat one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Dev=\r\natas are, however, Astral/Causal-bodied beings, so they would attempt to in=\r\nfluence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas=\r\n on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as=\r\n act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahk=\r\naranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (=\r\nego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) an=\r\nd remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of S=\r\nri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Causal body is=\r\n a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta=\r\n, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action,=\r\n 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemi=\r\ncal elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Now, as we all know that Physical body ex=\r\npires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go a=\r\nway at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the=\r\n corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent idea=\r\ns slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for =\r\nall other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal b=\r\nody is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Chitta with i=\r\nnfinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Buddhi being another=\r\n variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Ev=\r\nen illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from =\r\nAhamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned=\r\n Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnati=\r\nons. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent=\r\n ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container conta=\r\nining an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is =\r\nrequired for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including thos=\r\ne of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Gun=\r\na, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; repre=\r\nsents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Sa=\r\ntvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;   Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, o=\r\nnly Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflect=\r\ns on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizin=\r\ng its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   In Patanjali Yo=\r\nga Sutras:  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Egoi=\r\nsm is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanja=\r\nli has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Since astral-bodied being=\r\ns can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on =\r\n(refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots =\r\nin the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal=\r\n bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Hen=\r\nce, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is associated with=\r\n the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness, must be =\r\novercome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (ch=\r\napter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot=\r\n be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitt=\r\ned to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Se=\r\nnse-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   In Pat=\r\nanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;   dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   That effect which comes to these who have given up their =\r\nthirst after objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the =\r\nobjects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the =\r\nonly way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   This is to be accomplished by trans=\r\nferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma o=\r\nr otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga S=\r\nutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    yogashchittavrittinirodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Thus, extinguis=\r\nhing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   This=\r\n is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Causal-Body and=\r\n working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitis=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;=\r\npvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am=\r\n afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sen=\r\nse of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle bo=\r\ndy and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and aff=\r\nects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or con=\r\nditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana saree=\r\nra (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/e=\r\ngo controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes=\r\n sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current =\r\nand past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) s=\r\ntores various observations or retrieves previously stored observations, the=\r\ny are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates thr=\r\nough all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down the individualized con=\r\nsciousness into various groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sa=\r\nreeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkara=\r\nnas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basis of t=\r\nhe entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the wo=\r\nrd jnaana means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues=\r\n Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi r=\r\neaches the final target, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeah=\r\noo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear =\r\nNarasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    In my opinion, there are three distinct phases th=\r\nat lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the=\r\n three bodies physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) res=\r\np.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana   - Merging Physical =\r\nbody in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging=\r\n Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga   - M=\r\nerging Causal body in Causal cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Finally, be=\r\ncoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n   Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and withou=\r\nt a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is awa=\r\nre of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is p=\r\nerishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the pro=\r\ncess of elimination, finally finds the true Self.
