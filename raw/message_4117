This is a sort of smashan=C2=\r\n=A0vairagya, which is good but may not be good enough. Once you come out of=\r\n the smashan, the desires starts coming back in full force with more energy=\r\n. It is like forcing one self to cut off all things. But this kind of force=\r\n is only temporary.After a point the spring will jump back with greater for=\r\nce than before.\n=C2=A0\nThe other maybe a detachment resulting out of a high=\r\ner attachement. Which means that your love and surrenderance to your chosen=\r\n deity becomes so intense that you slowly lose interest in things of the wo=\r\nrld.

This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. Thi=\r\ns is condemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of th=\r\ne Lord. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana=\r\n if the body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as m=\r\nuch an evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. Th=\r\nis Abhimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than =\r\nthe Abhimana of worldly persons.\n\nVairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It =\r\nis difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the b=\r\nody-idea. The feeling, &quot;I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhiman=\r\na. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of humanit=\r\ny, is a public property. He has no claim on it because he denies the existe=\r\nnce of body and tries to feel always: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public wil=\r\nl take care of his body.\n\nLord Buddha tortured the body, did severe austeri=\r\nties, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He heard the=\r\n song:\n\n&quot;Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar&#39;s tuned, \n\nTune us the Sitar =\r\nneither low nor high. \n\nAnd we will dance away the hearts of men \n\nThe stri=\r\nng o&#39;erstretched breaks and the music flies,\n\nThe string o&#39;erslack is dumb =\r\nand music dies, \n\nTune us the Sitar neither low nor high.&quot;\n\nThen he ate foo=\r\nd, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asce=\r\nticism is not at all necessary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is =\r\nstrong mental Vairagya born of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fi=\r\nt for the practice of severe austerities. The body will drop down if you ta=\r\nx it too much by way of rigid Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in t=\r\nhe name of Tapas. Have a strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for t=\r\nhe body. Be prepared to give it up at any time for a noble cause.\n\nThe care=\r\n-taker of the horse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-worked, =\r\nwhen it is ailing. Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, this bo=\r\ndy should be injected with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn out goo=\r\nd work. Then only it will soon regain its lost vitality on account of overw=\r\nork or ailment. Work will suffer if the body is not well attended to. When =\r\nthe body grows old it must be well-protected against cold and well-looked a=\r\nfter. If hard Titiksha is practised now, it will give way soon. Consequentl=\r\ny, the other shore of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.\n\nO Ra=\r\nm, neglect not this body. The society and Prakriti will extract and continu=\r\ne to extract as much work as possible from those selfless workers who have =\r\ndedicated their lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to service=\r\n till the last breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, =\r\n&quot;My dear Prahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from =\r\nyour Samadhi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot; Yoga Vasi=\r\nshtha speaks of one as a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has renounced t=\r\nhe idea of &quot;I am a Tyagi&quot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither accepts nor rej=\r\nects things that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent =\r\nwitness, the Immortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am Akarta (non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I a=\r\nm Abhokta (non-enjoyer) &quot; even while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, =\r\n&quot;But the disciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with senses free fro=\r\nm attraction and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to\nPeace.&quot; Chapter I=\r\nI-64.\n\nSome neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; =\r\nor &quot;Maha Bhogins&quot; and quote scriptures also: &quot;We eat without tongues; we se=\r\ne without eyes&quot;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They ar=\r\ne just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their pa=\r\nlates and quote Gita:=E2=80=94&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pav=\r\nakah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;Weapons clea=\r\nve him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him a=\r\nway&quot;. Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellec=\r\nts! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines=\r\n under borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trish=\r\nnas and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocri=\r\nte without difficulty.\n\nA Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to accep=\r\nt some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he will n=\r\not crave for them. He will not say, &quot;I have enjoyed today good mangoes or g=\r\nood milk.&quot; If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not able to eat sol=\r\nid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk, if he has no=\r\n money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually offers of his own=\r\n accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He take=\r\ns care of his devotees by working through the minds of various persons.\n\nTh=\r\ne child sometimes eats food at night while he is sleeping. If the mother as=\r\nks the child in the morning. &quot;Baby, you took food last night,&quot; he replies, =\r\n&quot;I have not taken anything last night. You are playing and joking with me.&quot;=\r\n Such is the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He =\r\neats and yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smells without a =\r\nnose. Sometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you ask him when he=\r\n comes to waking consciousness, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last =\r\nnight when you were dreaming?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember anything.&quot; Suc=\r\nh is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.\n\nDurvasa at=\r\ne a sumptuous meal and yet he said, &quot;I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do not eat any=\r\nthing. I take grass juice only&quot;, because he identified himself with the Atm=\r\na who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is regarded a=\r\ns a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Sag=\r\ne Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, &quot;My beloved! Say unto the river that my hu=\r\nsband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give path of way. She will=\r\n at once yield and you can cross it without a boat.&quot; She repeated the words=\r\n of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She was quite amazed at =\r\nthe words of her husband and asked him, &quot;My Lord! You are living with me an=\r\nd yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am struck with wonder. I =\r\nam puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluvar replied, &quot;I am im=\r\nmortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognition (Anubhava). I do=\r\n not do anything. I am the silent witness. The senses,\nbody, mind and intel=\r\nlect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct from them.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s=\r\n wife understood the nature of the soul and then she became silent.\n\nOrdina=\r\nry aspirants with delicate health should not take recourse to the practice =\r\nof drastic austerities. He who has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of =\r\nTapas because his body is adamantine. If an aspirant with delicate health g=\r\nives up food and tries to live on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is =\r\nthat he will get various sorts of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away =\r\nsoon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.\n\nIf=\r\n you have mastery over the pair of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you c=\r\nan bear intense heat and intense cold, if you can remain without clothing i=\r\nn the icy Gangotri, this is highly creditable indeed. But if your frame is =\r\ndelicate, if you attempt to stand before the sun in summer for some hours, =\r\nif you throw off your clothing in the Gangotri all at once, you will die im=\r\nmediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. You should not attempt to take recours=\r\ne to these hard practices. What little you will gain by Japa and meditation=\r\n in this birth will be lost, and you have lost one chance given by the Lord=\r\n in this birth to reach him by your foolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.\n\nAn=\r\n aspirant gave up his clothing all at once. He developed rheumatism, malari=\r\na, enlarged spleen and died within a short time. During the period of sickn=\r\ness all cravings that were temporarily suppressed asserted themselves with =\r\nre-doubled force. He became a slave of the tongue. He craved for many varie=\r\nties of food. He could not suppress them. He ate indiscriminately and died =\r\nof acute diarrhoea.\n\nAn aspirant said, &quot;I have not realised the Self though=\r\n I did meditation for some years. I am going to commit suicide with the Bha=\r\nva, &quot;I am immortal Atma&quot;. I have got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me=\r\n, because my motive is pure. I will attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually =\r\ncommitted the abominable act. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the =\r\nscriptures? Certainly not. This is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who =\r\nhave no idea of the nature of true Vairagya, who have not lived under the g=\r\nuidance of their masters for some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can =\r\nnever get salvation by taking to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) ma=\r\ny be pure. They cannot entertain the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the time of =\r\ncommitting the act. Horrible thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. =\r\nThey will have to share obviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).\n\nThe mind sh=\r\nould gradually be weaned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off al=\r\nl at once its pleasure centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why=\r\n young aspirants who take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of co=\r\nmmitting suicide. You should train the mind in meditation gradually and mak=\r\ne it taste the inner bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and =\r\nold cravings and you can get yourself established in true Vairagya.\n\nThe mo=\r\nre the Viveka, the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually=\r\n grows in the garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world i=\r\ns a mere appearance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only=\r\n reality full of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of med=\r\nitation and association with the realised souls for a protracted period. Ev=\r\nentually, all objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as =\r\ntrifling or worthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life ev=\r\nen if the wealth of the whole world is offered to him.\n\nAspirants should gi=\r\nve up those articles of food which they like best for some time. They shoul=\r\nd discipline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead =\r\na simple life. They should always eat simple food. But they should not beco=\r\nme slaves of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses=\r\n this in his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual object=\r\ns.\n\nMay you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free fr=\r\nom the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!\n\nMay you all possess true lasting Para =\r\nVairagya!!\n\nMay you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !\n\nReal Vairagya\n\nT=\r\nhere was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear heat=\r\n and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for some hours. In winter =\r\nhe used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He used to sleep on a bed of=\r\n grass. He shunned wooden cots.\n\nOn one occasion one of his admirers, Sri R=\r\nam, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyas=\r\ni refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him to provide a bed of grass. Ther=\r\ne was much rain on that day. It was extremely difficult for him to get gras=\r\ns. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the Swami a bed of grass with great d=\r\nifficulty.\n\nSri Ram said: &quot;Swamiji, it is very difficult to get grass here.=\r\n It is raining now in torrents. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bin=\r\nd you in any way. You are an advanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether =\r\nthe body lies on a bed of grass or on a cot?&quot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, =\r\nno. I must have my usual bed of grass only. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;\n\nAtt=\r\nachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a =\r\nmeans for attaining wisdom of the Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevan=\r\nmukta or realised sage has neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a lit=\r\ntle dry bread alone, he is quite satisfied. He will not grumble. If you giv=\r\ne him best sweetmeats, milk and fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not=\r\n be elated by good food. He always takes delight in his own Self only, but =\r\nnot in external objects. This is the test to find out whether a man has att=\r\nained realisation or not. A worldly man is much troubled when he cannot get=\r\n the right kind of food which he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains pa=\r\nlatable dishes. A realised soul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes a=\r\nnd dislikes.\n\nSuka Deva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food=\r\n at the gate for some days. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the=\r\n harem. Ranees served him and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. T=\r\nhis is wisdom.\n\nObviously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie=\r\n had not attained equanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached =\r\nto Vairagya even after several years of spiritual practice. He was not comp=\r\nletely free from all sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairag=\r\nya. He did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is q=\r\nuite indifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on t=\r\nhe bed of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same f=\r\neeling.\n\nHe who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is calle=\r\nd a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vair=\r\nagya, but it is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.\n\nSome San=\r\nnyasins who are working for the public good make resolves: &quot;We will not tra=\r\nvel in trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We wi=\r\nll not use fountain pens or watch.&quot; These are not desirable resolves. This =\r\nis not the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. Thi=\r\ns is another kind of defect. They want to do service. If they move in cars =\r\nor trains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, they can do more servi=\r\nce in a short space of time. Those who do much writing-work can turn out mu=\r\nch work if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This=\r\n is one kind. It does not leave even educated persons or cultured Sannyasin=\r\ns.\n\nSome Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and=\r\n respect. But God knows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner=\r\n Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.\n\nWhere is the strength of Vairagya when one=\r\n lives in seclusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the strength of=\r\n Vairagya when one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing to renou=\r\nnce, when he has not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there is no att=\r\nraction in the mind for the objects of the world even though he shows exter=\r\nnally that he is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny=\r\n bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only in his hand?\n\nRaja Janaka was amid=\r\nst regal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila was burst and=\r\n yet, he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He alone can be cal=\r\nled a real great Virakta.\n\nYoung aspirants should be very careful and cauti=\r\nous. They should not take advantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Ma=\r\nha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal =\r\nvision over all beings. Beginners should stick to their resolves of Truth, =\r\nAhimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter and spirit.\n\nMay you a=\r\nll transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self. May you al=\r\nl understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.\n\nVairagya is the rei=\r\nn by which the uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense =\r\nattachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for anything other than Atm=\r\na.\n\nIf one considers the position and happiness of Brahma even as the dung =\r\nof a cow, then only he has developed a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fle=\r\neting dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help the aspirant in the atta=\r\ninment of Self-realisation.\n\nIt is common to have dispassion for some parti=\r\ncular objects by some cause or other. But by having dispassion for all obje=\r\ncts at all times, one will get knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnan=\r\na soon by the grace of the Guru, by devotion to him, and by practice of wha=\r\nt he instructs.\n\nDo not fall a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in=\r\n towns with young and well-adored fashionable ladies of high civilised soci=\r\neties. Resolve to attain Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its =\r\nown accord.\n\nDevotion, dispassion and knowledge of Atma are the three means=\r\n of salvation. Dispassion is desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in t=\r\nhe chambers of the heart and so everybody has this Atma.\n\nLight on Vairagya=\r\n\n\nVairagya is born of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eter=\r\nnal and non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. =\r\nViveka comes through disinterested selfless service done in several births =\r\nand through Puja and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Vive=\r\nka is born Vairagya. It gives spiritual strength.\n\nA man of Vairagya has no=\r\n attraction for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, in=\r\nexhaustible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, =\r\nSamadhana, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberatio=\r\nn or Emancipation, or Release.\n\nRaga is attachment to objects. Wherever the=\r\nre is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is di=\r\nslike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important a=\r\nfflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avid=\r\nya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinive=\r\nsha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avidya. Fro=\r\nm this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and fro=\r\nm Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.\n\nVairagya is of diff=\r\nerent types or degrees=E2=80=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderate a=\r\nnd intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to stick to this =\r\npath. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya, th=\r\ne mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that were renounced p=\r\nreviously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not be able to cli=\r\nmb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants should be careful=\r\n. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try to make it mo=\r\nderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into the defects of=\r\n sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is illusory, tran=\r\nsient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and again by looking in=\r\nto the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthened t=\r\nhrough study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.\n\nSimply liv=\r\ning in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow&#39;s urine does not con=\r\nstitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of discrimination, enquiry a=\r\nnd Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual enjoyments and render=\r\ned thin like a thread=E2=80=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 and then only the Vairag=\r\nya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make enquiry. Physical nudi=\r\nty and these external things will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vairag=\r\nya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objects do not give us last=\r\ning happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, again =\r\nand again, persisted in for a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya. It=\r\n is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It ma=\r\nkes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert tende=\r\nncy of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards objects, at once it will poi=\r\nnt out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyment is the cause\nfor re=\r\nbirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gradually =\r\nthrough intense practice, it is established in real, lasting, sustained, in=\r\ntense Vairagya.\n\nVairagya is of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vai=\r\nragya. Para Vairagya comes after one attains Self-realisation. The whole wo=\r\nrld then looks like a straw. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Pa=\r\nra Vairagya.\n\nWithout Vairagya there cannot be any real spiritual progress.=\r\n In Vedanta it is the only vital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya=\r\n, all other virtues will come by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhya=\r\nasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by medit=\r\nation or Sadhana and Vairagya.&quot; They are the two wings of the aspirant to s=\r\noar high into the realm of Immortal Abode. The same thing Lord Krishna also=\r\n says. &quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihyate&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;The mind i=\r\ns controlled by practice and Vairagya, dispassion, intense detachment.&quot; By =\r\nVairagya, the mind is detached. He who works in a detached way is not bound=\r\n by Karma. So it is aspirants&#39; duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhan=\r\na-anka, Vairagya.\n\nVairagya is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind do=\r\nes not run into sensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen =\r\nChudalai ruled a kingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amid=\r\nst the temptations of the world, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and=\r\n wisdom. So she was not affected in the least by the attractive objects of =\r\nthe world, even though she ruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaj=\r\na, went to the forest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was not established in=\r\n Vairagya. He was attached to the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A=\r\n man may be attached to any one object.\n\nYou see a Vairagi. His whole body =\r\nis smeared with ash, but he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a=\r\n rupee to another Vairagi. This is his mental state. So by external appeara=\r\nnce you cannot tell that one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri =\r\nRamanuja does not belong to this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing o=\r\nnly a rope around the waist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind w=\r\nas not polluted. He had that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indiffer=\r\nence, born of Viveka.\n\nLord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extrem=\r\ne asceticism. &quot;Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaiva=\r\nntassareerast ham tan vidhyasuranischayan .&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;They torture all the =\r\nelements in the body and Me also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord Buddha also =\r\ntortured his body, and later on he found out that there was not much spirit=\r\nual progress; and then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we=\r\n should go by the middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaini=\r\nng Self-realisation. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones=\r\n. So you should not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you s=\r\nhould have. You should not expose the body to chill. God has given common s=\r\nense. So you should practise &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm in ta=\r\nking good, healthy food. Every man has got a different physical constitutio=\r\nn. You should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you =\r\ncannot sit for a long\ntime in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash=\r\n or some fruits. You should have extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya internally an=\r\nd at the same time follow the middle path externally.\n\nGenerally, aspirants=\r\n say: &quot;I have given up umbrella.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I take only one meal.&quot; Their wh=\r\nole Sadhana is: &quot;I have given up shirt.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I have given up sweater.=\r\n&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I have given up shoes.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal=\r\n.&quot; Their Sadhana consists in &quot;giving up&quot;=E2=80=94give up this, give up that=\r\n. Real spiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no=\r\n giving up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to th=\r\ne mind. If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and=\r\n a small cup of milk. Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency =\r\nto the mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigila=\r\nnt.\n\nAt the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is =\r\na great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing i=\r\nn the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gav=\r\ne a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a=\r\n wonderful man and made him his Guru.\n\nAvadhoot Kesavananda is another Vair=\r\nagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji. He al=\r\nways slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused to sl=\r\neep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to=\r\n sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this =\r\ncult. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, and the=\r\ny wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This is Va=\r\niragya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni =\r\nTapas. They have got a physical body.\n\nThere is another great Vairagi, our =\r\nSendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to take=\r\n food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after meals. &quot;Avadho=\r\notas&quot; are naked people. They have no clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is on=\r\ne who has shaved his mind of all Vasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, y=\r\nou will have Manolaya. Brahmendra Swami lived a very austere life. He was P=\r\noornabodha&#39; s Guru and Swami Krishnananda&#39; s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they=\r\n prepared very good food, and Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given=\r\n to cows. He used to make severe tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. =\r\nHe had a very strong body and lived an austere life.\n\n------------ --------=\r\n- ---\n\n`Light on Vairagya&#39; will resume next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Your =\r\nMail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8.

O=\r\nne is the detachment of a smahsan. When&nbsp;someone goes to a smashan&nbsp=\r\n;for whatever purpose, he/she feels a sense&nbsp;of detachment&nbsp;regardi=\r\nng most material purposes. This is a sort of smashan&nbsp;vairagya, which i=\r\ns good but may not be good enough. Once you come out of the smashan, the de=\r\nsires starts coming back in full force with more energy. It is like forcing=\r\n one self to cut off all things. But this kind of force is only temporary.A=\r\nfter a point the spring will jump back with greater force than before.&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The other maybe a detachment resulting out of a hi=\r\ngher attachement. Which means that your love and surrenderance to your chos=\r\nen deity becomes so intense that you slowly lose interest in things of the =\r\nworld. That maybe a more long lasting detachment.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FON=\r\nT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;=\r\n&quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;MARGIN=\r\n: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;=\r\n&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 4/4/10, Adi=\r\nti Banerjee &lt;I&gt;&lt;banerjeea@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2p=\r\nx solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: R=\r\ne: [vedic-wisdom] Sadhana Chatushtaya by Sri Swami Sivananda&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Sunday, 4 April, 2010, 8:13 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV =\r\nid=3Dyiv148182344&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyg=\r\nrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He wasn&#39;t saying to indulge in anything, but to realize that =\r\none shouldn&#39;t get hung up in the other direction either. The objective is t=\r\no have neither aversion nor attachment. For most of us, we have to practice=\r\n not having attachment, because we indulge excessively, but this is a point=\r\ner to not go too much the other way, because that creates its own unhealthy=\r\n attachment/aversion .

This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is=\r\n condemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lo=\r\nrd. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if =\r\nthe body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much =\r\nan evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This A=\r\nbhimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the =\r\nAbhimana of worldly persons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. I=\r\nt is difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the=\r\n body-idea. The feeling, &quot;I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhim=\r\nana. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of human=\r\nity, is a public\n property. He has no claim on it because he denies the exi=\r\nstence of body and tries to feel always: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public =\r\nwill take care of his body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lord Buddha tortured the body, did sever=\r\ne austerities, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He =\r\nheard the song:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar&#39;s tuned, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And we will dance away t=\r\nhe hearts of men &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The string o&#39;erstretched breaks and the music flie=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The string o&#39;erslack is dumb and music dies, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tune us the =\r\nSitar neither low nor high.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then he ate food, adopted the middle pa=\r\nth and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all nec=\r\nessary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya b=\r\norn of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practice of se=\r\nvere austerities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by way of =\r\nrigid\n Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have =\r\na strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to=\r\n give it up at any time for a noble cause.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The care-taker of the hor=\r\nse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing=\r\n. Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, this body should be inje=\r\ncted with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only=\r\n it will soon regain its lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. W=\r\nork will suffer if the body is not well attended to. When the body grows ol=\r\nd it must be well-protected against cold and well-looked after. If hard Tit=\r\niksha is practised now, it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shor=\r\ne of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O Ram, neglect =\r\nnot this body. The society and Prakriti will extract and continue to extrac=\r\nt as much work as possible from those selfless workers who have dedicated\n =\r\ntheir lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to service till the =\r\nlast breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, &quot;My dear P=\r\nrahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samad=\r\nhi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot; Yoga Vasishtha spea=\r\nks of one as a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has renounced the idea of=\r\n &quot;I am a Tyagi&quot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither accepts nor rejects thing=\r\ns that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent witness, t=\r\nhe Immortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am Akarta (non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I am Abhokta =\r\n(non-enjoyer) &quot; even while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, &quot;But the d=\r\nisciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with senses free from attracti=\r\non and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to&lt;BR&gt;Peace.&quot; Chapter II-64.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;Maha Bhogins&quot; and quote scriptures also: &quot;We eat without\n tongues; we se=\r\ne without eyes&quot;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They ar=\r\ne just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their pa=\r\nlates and quote Gita:=E2=80=94&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pav=\r\nakah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;Weapons clea=\r\nve him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him a=\r\nway&quot;. Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellec=\r\nts! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines=\r\n under borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trish=\r\nnas and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocri=\r\nte without difficulty.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to=\r\n accept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he =\r\nwill not crave for them. He will not say, &quot;I have enjoyed today good mangoe=\r\ns or good milk.&quot; If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not\n able to =\r\neat solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk, if he=\r\n has no money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually offers of =\r\nhis own accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteriously. =\r\nHe takes care of his devotees by working through the minds of various perso=\r\nns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The child sometimes eats food at night while he is sleeping. If =\r\nthe mother asks the child in the morning. &quot;Baby, you took food last night,&quot;=\r\n he replies, &quot;I have not taken anything last night. You are playing and jok=\r\ning with me.&quot; Such is the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Ma=\r\nha Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smel=\r\nls without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you as=\r\nk him when he comes to waking consciousness, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you=\r\n talked last night when you were dreaming?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember a=\r\nnything.&quot; Such is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha\n Tyagi and Maha Bhog=\r\ni.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he said, &quot;I am a Nitya Upava=\r\nsi. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only&quot;, because he identified =\r\nhimself with the Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord K=\r\nrishna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini=\r\n and Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, &quot;My beloved! Say unto =\r\nthe river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give p=\r\nath of way. She will at once yield and you can cross it without a boat.&quot; Sh=\r\ne repeated the words of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She =\r\nwas quite amazed at the words of her husband and asked him, &quot;My Lord! You a=\r\nre living with me and yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am st=\r\nruck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluv=\r\nar replied, &quot;I am immortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognit=\r\nion (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the\n silent witness. The senses,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct fro=\r\nm them.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s wife understood the nature of the soul and then sh=\r\ne became silent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ordinary aspirants with delicate health should not =\r\ntake recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He who has attained K=\r\naya Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an a=\r\nspirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to live on neem leaves=\r\n alone, the obvious result is that he will get various sorts of gastro-inte=\r\nstinal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons w=\r\nho practise Tamasic Tapas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have mastery over the pair of oppo=\r\nsites, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense heat and intense cold, =\r\nif you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri, this is highly cred=\r\nitable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you attempt to stand befor=\r\ne the sun in summer for some hours, if\n you throw off your clothing in the =\r\nGangotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. Y=\r\nou should not attempt to take recourse to these hard practices. What little=\r\n you will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth will be lost, and you h=\r\nave lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to reach him by your fo=\r\nolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An aspirant gave up his clothing a=\r\nll at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died with=\r\nin a short time. During the period of sickness all cravings that were tempo=\r\nrarily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled force. He became a sl=\r\nave of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of food. He could not suppr=\r\ness them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute diarrhoea.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An as=\r\npirant said, &quot;I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for some=\r\n years. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, &quot;I am immortal Atma&quot;. =\r\nI have got full Vairagya. No sin\n will cling to me, because my motive is pu=\r\nre. I will attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually committed the abominable =\r\nact. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not=\r\n. This is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the natur=\r\ne of true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters =\r\nfor some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by ta=\r\nking to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot en=\r\ntertain the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the time of committing the act. Horri=\r\nble thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to share o=\r\nbviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mind should gradually be w=\r\neaned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleas=\r\nure centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants wh=\r\no take to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. Y=\r\nou should train the mind\n in meditation gradually and make it taste the inn=\r\ner bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and y=\r\nou can get yourself established in true Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The more the Vivek=\r\na, the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in th=\r\ne garden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world is a mere app=\r\nearance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality ful=\r\nl of knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and =\r\nassociation with the realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, al=\r\nl objects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or =\r\nworthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life even if the we=\r\nalth of the whole world is offered to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Aspirants should give up =\r\nthose articles of food which they like best for some time. They should disc=\r\nipline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simp=\r\nle life. They\n should always eat simple food. But they should not become sl=\r\naves of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this=\r\n in his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free f=\r\nrom the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all possess true lastin=\r\ng Para Vairagya!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Real Vairagya&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Tit=\r\nikshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun f=\r\nor some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He =\r\nused to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On one occa=\r\nsion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided =\r\nhim a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him =\r\nto provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. It was extremel=\r\ny\n difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the S=\r\nwami a bed of grass with great difficulty.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Ram said: &quot;Swamiji, i=\r\nt is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents. Kindl=\r\ny use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an advanced=\r\n Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of grass or on=\r\n a cot?&quot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I must have my usual bed of grass=\r\n only. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Attachment to Vairagya is as much =\r\nan evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wisdom of t=\r\nhe Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neit=\r\nher Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, he is quit=\r\ne satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats, milk and=\r\n fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good food. He alw=\r\nays takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external objects.\n This =\r\nis the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or not. A wo=\r\nrldly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of food which =\r\nhe likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A realised sou=\r\nl has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suka Deva =\r\nwas tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate for some da=\r\nys. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees served hi=\r\nm and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ob=\r\nviously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained =\r\nequanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even a=\r\nfter several years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from a=\r\nll sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not att=\r\nain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent t=\r\no all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the\n bed of grass o=\r\nr a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He=\r\n who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha Ty=\r\nagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but i=\r\nt is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some Sannyasi=\r\nns who are working for the public good make resolves: &quot;We will not travel i=\r\nn trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will no=\r\nt use fountain pens or watch.&quot; These are not desirable resolves. This is no=\r\nt the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is =\r\nanother kind of defect. They want to do service. If they move in cars or tr=\r\nains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, they can do more service in=\r\n a short space of time. Those who do much writing-work can turn out much wo=\r\nrk if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is o=\r\nne kind. It does not leave even educated persons or\n cultured Sannyasins.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame a=\r\nnd respect. But God knows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inn=\r\ner Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where is the strength of Vairagya =\r\nwhen one lives in seclusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the str=\r\nength of Vairagya when one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing =\r\nto renounce, when he has not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there i=\r\ns no attraction in the mind for the objects of the world even though he sho=\r\nws externally that he is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on=\r\n a gunny bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only in his hand?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raja J=\r\nanaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila=\r\n was burst and yet, he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He al=\r\none can be called a real great Virakta.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Young aspirants should be ve=\r\nry careful and cautious. They should not take\n advantage of the liberty of =\r\na Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yo=\r\ngi who has got equal vision over all beings. Beginners should stick to thei=\r\nr resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter a=\r\nnd spirit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowle=\r\ndge of the Self. May you all understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vai=\r\nragya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollable mind is rest=\r\nrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispa=\r\nssion for anything other than Atma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one considers the position an=\r\nd happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has developed=\r\n a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairagya. It=\r\n will not help the aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\nt is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or=\r\n other. But by having dispassion for\n all objects at all times, one will ge=\r\nt knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Gu=\r\nru, by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do not=\r\n fall a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and w=\r\nell-adored fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attai=\r\nn Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Devo=\r\ntion, dispassion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Di=\r\nspassion is desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of th=\r\ne heart and so everybody has this Atma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Light on Vairagya&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vai=\r\nragya is born of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal a=\r\nnd non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Vivek=\r\na comes through disinterested selfless service done in several births and t=\r\nhrough Puja and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is=\r\n born Vairagya. It gives\n spiritual strength.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A man of Vairagya has =\r\nno attraction for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, =\r\ninexhaustible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind=\r\n, Samadhana, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberat=\r\nion or Emancipation, or Release.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raga is attachment to objects. Wher=\r\never there is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, the=\r\nre is dislike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the imp=\r\nortant afflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions a=\r\nre: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and =\r\nAbhinivesha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avi=\r\ndya. From this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha,=\r\n and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vaira=\r\ngya is of different types or degrees=E2=80=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mi=\r\nld, moderate and\n intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to=\r\n stick to this path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasa=\r\nva Vairagya, the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that w=\r\nere renounced previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not=\r\n be able to climb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants sh=\r\nould be careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should tr=\r\ny to make it moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into=\r\n the defects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is=\r\n illusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and agai=\r\nn by looking into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be=\r\n strengthened through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enqui=\r\nry.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow=\r\n&#39;s urine does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of\n dis=\r\ncrimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual=\r\n enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=E2=80=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 an=\r\nd then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make =\r\nenquiry. Physical nudity and these external things will not constitute real=\r\n Vairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objec=\r\nts do not give us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Suc=\r\nh deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time, produce=\r\ns lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to =\r\ndo real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break =\r\nto the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards object=\r\ns, at once it will point out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyme=\r\nnt is the cause&lt;BR&gt;for rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terrib=\r\nly afraid, and gradually through intense practice, it is established in\n re=\r\nal, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya is of two kinds a=\r\nlso: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes after one attain=\r\ns Self-realisation. The whole world then looks like a straw. That is intens=\r\ne spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Without Vairagya there =\r\ncannot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only vital, fun=\r\ndamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will come by them=\r\nselves. Patanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=E2=\r\n=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya.&quot; They =\r\nare the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal A=\r\nbode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. &quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairag=\r\nyena cha grihyate&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by practice and Vairagya=\r\n, dispassion, intense detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the mind is detached. He wh=\r\no works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspirants&#39; duty t=\r\no\n cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya is=\r\n doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual groove=\r\ns. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and =\r\nyet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the worl=\r\nd, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not affect=\r\ned in the least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she rul=\r\ned a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renounci=\r\nng his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached to =\r\nthe body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any on=\r\ne object.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but=\r\n he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairag=\r\ni. This is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that=\r\n one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not\n belon=\r\ng to this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing only a rope around the w=\r\naist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had=\r\n that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. &quot;Ka=\r\nrshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham=\r\n tan vidhyasuranischayan .&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;They torture all the elements in the b=\r\nody and Me also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord Buddha also tortured his body=\r\n, and later on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; and=\r\n then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by the=\r\n middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisati=\r\non. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should n=\r\not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You s=\r\nhould not expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you\n sho=\r\nuld practise &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm in taking good, healt=\r\nhy food. Every man has got a different physical constitution. You should us=\r\ne common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot sit for a=\r\n long&lt;BR&gt;time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some frui=\r\nts. You should have extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya internally and at the same=\r\n time follow the middle path externally.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Generally, aspirants say: &quot;=\r\nI have given up umbrella.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I take only one meal.&quot; Their whole Sad=\r\nhana is: &quot;I have given up shirt.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I have given up sweater.&quot;=E2=80=\r\n=A6 &quot;I have given up shoes.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&quot; Thei=\r\nr Sadhana consists in &quot;giving up&quot;=E2=80=94give up this, give up that. Real =\r\nspiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving=\r\n up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind.=\r\n If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a smal=\r\nl cup of milk.\n Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the=\r\n mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is =\r\na great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing i=\r\nn the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gav=\r\ne a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a=\r\n wonderful man and made him his Guru.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Avadhoot Kesavananda is anothe=\r\nr Vairagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji.=\r\n He always slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused=\r\n to sleep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for =\r\nhim to sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to=\r\n this cult. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, a=\r\nnd they wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This=\r\n is\n Vairagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Pan=\r\nchagni Tapas. They have got a physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is another great =\r\nVairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He=\r\n used to take food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after m=\r\neals. &quot;Avadhootas&quot; are naked people. They have no clothing or home.
