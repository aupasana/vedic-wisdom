My name is Shathish and im from Malaysia. Im cur=\r\nrently 28 years old and single. I came across of your Ganapathy Homam video=\r\n couple months a ago and it caught my attention seriously =A0until it becam=\r\ne my passion to perform it.\n\nI went and consulted few priest in the temples=\r\n and most of them discouraged me as they told me i need to learn the mantha=\r\nrs and im not eligible for it. Moreover, i went through many obstacles to p=\r\nerform this Ganapathy Homam for the last 6 months. Finally, upon God`s grac=\r\ne i managed to prepared myself for it smoothly and came up to conclusion to=\r\n perform this Ganapthy Homam =A0for 60 days. As for this the protocols are =\r\nbeing setup such ways below;\n-Renting a house separately for 2 months\n-Boug=\r\nht all the materials needed for the Homam\n-Fasting with breakfast one type =\r\nof fruit and milk(eat after served in front of Lord Ganesha during Homam). =\r\nLunch would be one small plate of steamed Green Gram and dinner would be on=\r\ne fruit and one tumbler of cow milk. All this will be cook and prepared my =\r\nownslef as im staying alone\n-Sleeping using a mat and pillowed with paper w=\r\nrapped with dhoti\n-No entertainments such as movies, radio stations, cinema=\r\ns, smoking, consuming alcohol, etc.\n-Only listen to Bhajans, Manthras and r=\r\nead Hinduisme articles\n-Wearing Malai( a type of holy chain worn around dur=\r\ning fastings) to control all my senses\n- No cutting finger nails and hair f=\r\nor this 2 months\n-Wash my own clothes\n\n\nThe procedures applies the same of =\r\nyours from the beginning till the end. yhe additional part is the manthars =\r\nas flow below;\n-Ganapathy Shodaspachara with Narayana Suktham (16 services)=\r\n\n-Ganapathy Moola Manthra 12X ( Aum Gam Ganapathye....)\n-Ganapathy Moola Ma=\r\nnthra 12X ( Aum Gajanam Tuah Ganapatim Hava..)\n-Ganpathy Stotram 3X\n-Ganapa=\r\nthy Atharavaseerasham 3X\n-Ganapathy Kaari Sakti Malai 21X\n\nI bought all the=\r\n additional materials needed such as honey,sesame seeds, some murmura, some=\r\n nuts,popped corn and other materials that can be offered in fire. for the =\r\ndaily basis i buy flowers and arugumpul (sacred grass for Lord Vinayaka)Mor=\r\neover, for Poornahuti i will put a whole cocunut with few coins, 9 navagani=\r\ns(types of beans used for prayers), coins, and with vibuthi, kunkumum, sand=\r\nal wood powder, turmeric powder, etc.\n\nI have full support from my parents.=\r\n They like pillars to me in this matter. In fact i do have a Brahmin Iyer c=\r\nhildhood friend who clears my doubt when it comes to Ganapathy Homam. He is=\r\n the one who prepares all the dharbas for me, teaches me other important ab=\r\nout Homam, teaches me how to maintain the fire. Additioanlly, he is the one=\r\n who suggest me to put water Pot and bath with it every morning. All this h=\r\nappens because of Lord Ganesha. In fact, my family, friends, and other are =\r\nastonished of my actions. I took 6 months to learn all the manthars and act=\r\nions of this homam from the manual and the videos.\n\nEven though i fall easi=\r\nly tired because im working and fasting but in the end it gives me a kind o=\r\nf pleasure and self-satisfaction of the Homam completion.Its just sometimes=\r\n the intonation and the pronunciation compared to yours will be different. =\r\nSometimes the coconut that i put for Poornahuti will not crack till end. So=\r\nmetimes i miss certain rituals. These are things actually makes me upset be=\r\ncause i want to do it perfectly. Whatever it is, my devotion to LORD GANESH=\r\nA is divine.\n\nAs im sending this email to you today it has been 21 days of =\r\nperforming the Ganesha Homam and 39 days to go on. On the 56th day of this =\r\nHomam will be the VInayagar Chathurti day which falls 9th September 2013. I=\r\nm doing this =A0as iam not expecting much from this outcome rather want to =\r\nchallenge myself from being discipline and after the 60th day i want my lif=\r\ne to have better enhancement and all ways.\n\nFinally what i would like to ex=\r\ntend is my gratitude to you is there is no common word as THANK YOU to you =\r\nas you have taught me something which is been hiding for thousands of years=\r\n from eye of public. Every beginning of the Homam i think of you and your f=\r\namily in well-being, off course Dr. Manish Pandit, all the Gurus,Pandits, =\r\n=A0Rishis, Mahans, Munis, Thevargals, etc.\n\n\nThank You so much Mr.PVR Naras=\r\nimha Rao.\n\nKeep in touch :)\n\nRegards,\nShathish Rengayan\nSelangor, Malaysia.\r\n---994738946-1422306005-1375601626=:87436\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;Dear Sir,&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont face=3D&quot;times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;How are you?
