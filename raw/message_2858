I have been visiting this temple since the age of 10 and=\r\n I have seen how things have changed around the temple but fortunately the =\r\npeace inside the temple still prevails and I do get a lot of positive energ=\r\ny. Incidently, my Istha devata is Maa Kaali and I could feel her divine gra=\r\nce much more than Kaalighat ( my personal opinion).\n=A0\nOver the period of =\r\nyears the temple has gained importance nationally / globally due to=A0Sri R=\r\namkrishna, Sharda Maa and Swami Vivekanda&#39;s ashram. Hence the pilgrims & to=\r\nurist inflow has increased by many folds but still the authorities are tryi=\r\nng to maintain a clean atmosphere / surroundings as compared to Kaalighat. =\r\n\n=A0\nHere too the priest are commercial minded but not as much obvious as i=\r\nn Kaalighat. The devotees do not get much time to have the darshan of Maa d=\r\nue to the long crowd as well as your feet will burn if the sun is shining b=\r\nright. But what I suggest is that just opposite to the temple is a open hal=\r\nl from where Maa Kaali can be seen clearly as Maa&#39;s idol is much elevated=\r\n=A0 (please note that you will have to take about 20 steps to have her dars=\r\nhan). I sit in this hall and try to get a place where I can see her clearly=\r\n and then meditate once my system has absorbed her full Rupa - a pleasant f=\r\neeling. Forget the crowd around you and you can have a good dialouge with M=\r\naa. \n=A0\nAfter Maa&#39;s darshan walk down to the abode of Shri Ramkrishna , yo=\r\nur mind will be so peaceful after the meditation - so much of positive ener=\r\ngy around there. The next hop would be a pleasant boat ride ( I prefer that=\r\n as it make me close to mother nature - car ride is also possible)=A0visit =\r\nthe Swami Vivekananda Ashram . Well I bet the day is well spent and you wil=\r\nl feel better.\n=A0\n(this is my personal experience and it might differ from=\r\n others, but a place worth visiting)\n\n\nWarm Regards,=A0\n\nDebabrato Sarkar\n\n=\r\n\n--- On Mon, 10/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFro=\r\nm: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: =\r\nHoly Places\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Monday, October 12, 2009=\r\n, 7:20 AM\n\n\n=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Sunita,\n=A0\nIf you are going to the Kaalighat=\r\n temple, you need to be careful of the local priests/pandas.

While diffe=\r\nrent places and times have some difference in the nature and degree of spir=\r\nitual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if the internal=\r\n factors are conducive.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kal=\r\nighat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind that any observation is=\r\n fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual ene=\r\nrgy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What we a=\r\nre able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental conditionin=\r\ng and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creativ=\r\ne/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that i=\r\nt is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaching God, is it not enough?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The purpose of an idol =\r\nis to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagin=\r\nes a particular energy or form of god in a particular object on a continuou=\r\ns basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on,=\r\n his mind can be focused on that specific form faster and easier by simply =\r\nlooking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separate entities, =\r\nthey are all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some va=\r\ngue form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus=\r\n, if an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a =\r\nperson trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some si=\r\nmilar thoughts in another person too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, there is some trans=\r\nlation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpr=\r\neted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditi=\r\noning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to our own mental co=\r\nnditioning!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to an i=\r\ndol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings peo=\r\nple under one&#39;s control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that=\r\n idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you s=\r\nee her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispass=\r\nionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone us=\r\ned that idol as a repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstructi=\r\non.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, please note that this principle works without an idol=\r\n too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and =\r\nprays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are pre=\r\nsent in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little susceptib=\r\nle to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little higher w=\r\nhen an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; However, please note that most people have some devotion, some surrend=\r\ner, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, wi=\r\nthin or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also a=\r\nccompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned i=\r\ns not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable only in rare cases of =\r\nreally taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practices without understand=\r\ning what they are doing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is Idol worship risky?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottoml=\r\nine is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; God created man as his =\r\nreplica. But the replica got corrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreat=\r\ne god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that he can go back to the=\r\n source and become free from this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ condi=\r\ntioning of the mind, he is not able to create god correctly. He ends up cre=\r\nating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! The goal is to keep cr=\r\neating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep refining oneself an=\r\nd eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates god as a replica of =\r\noneself, that god will match the god that created man in the first place. W=\r\nhen that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free from the cycle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about respected=\r\n spiritual leaders of other religions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, please remember=\r\n that saying negative things about people that one may not have understood =\r\nfully or correctly is unwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From time to time, the Lord may send=\r\n someone to a part of the world to maintain the correct balance of dharma a=\r\nnd adhrama that is required in that part of the world at that time. One can=\r\nnot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done =\r\nby people claiming to follow that person. Worse things may have happened if=\r\n god did not send that person! If some people following a yogi or spiritual=\r\n teacher attained some level of realization, it means something. Let us not=\r\n be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; If one is unhappy because of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a =\r\nfollow a yogi or spiritual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will=\r\n correct things and change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things=\r\n to Nature and do your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is th=\r\nat we are on the cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=\r\nic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast.=\r\n net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, October 08, 2009 2:38 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To add to m=\r\ny query, a good number of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If th=\r\ne underlying truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can =\r\nunderstand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human imagination =\r\nwhich maynot have a divine link.

There was a certain individual, who whenever he would go to Calc=\r\nutta. he would take time out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the =\r\nidol at the Kaalighat temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sa=\r\nt there trying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very =\r\nfocused, he *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagi=\r\nnation) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind be=\r\ncome without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world, everythi=\r\nng was perfect. Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he neede=\r\nd to worship the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missi=\r\nng, so he walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extreme=\r\nly dirty road but all he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually register=\r\ning in his mind that night, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said late=\r\nr\n on. Bottomline: a nice spiritual experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some months later =\r\nhe ended up meeting a very spiritual person who instructed him about worshi=\r\npping the Goddess. He strongly believes that night at the temple and his me=\r\neting with the person was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual perso=\r\nn told him that there is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaa=\r\nlighat temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat te=\r\nmple did not have a divine presence why did this person suddenly have such =\r\na nice meditation there? Does it mean that finally it is only the devotion =\r\nof the devotee which counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespect=\r\nive of whether the idol has any energy at all?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajars=\r\nhi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy=\r\n Places\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 8 Octobe=\r\nr, 2009, 8:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this context of divine =\r\npressence, is Idol worship risky?

The rituals performed every few years to re-ene=\r\nrgize the idols \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my humble opinion that some =\r\nfamous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not want=\r\n to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem =\r\nto have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the =\r\nKrishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gu=\r\njarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). Th=\r\nere is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are s=\r\neveral temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 y=\r\nears after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is=\r\n &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple w=\r\nhich is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu=\r\n that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all =\r\nover Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I =\r\nnever heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The na=\r\nme of the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name=\r\n and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, whe=\r\nn I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the id=\r\nol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiti=\r\nng rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortun=\r\nately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a =\r\ntemple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the god=\r\ndess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and t=\r\nhey finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we =\r\nspent only 5 min and\n left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple.=\r\n Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divin=\r\ne presence across India.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshinesh=\r\nwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal =\r\ntemple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still med=\r\nitating in the underground chamber there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even the =\r\nmiddle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in US=\r\nA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is raj=\r\nas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temp=\r\nle in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is =\r\nnot much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a t=\r\nemple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and K=\r\namakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Na=\r\nrayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and G=\r\nirnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikes=\r\nh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. =\r\nVisiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for several months wh=\r\nile maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homa=\r\nm or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent:=\r\n Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Place=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to know your o=\r\npinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in today&#39;s time.

I have been visiting this temple since the age of 10 and =\r\nI have seen how things have changed around the temple but fortunately the p=\r\neace inside the temple still prevails and I do get a lot of positive energy=\r\n. Incidently, my Istha devata is Maa Kaali and I could feel her divine grac=\r\ne much more than Kaalighat ( my personal opinion).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\ncolor=3D#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;Over the per=\r\niod of years the temple has gained importance nationally / globally due to&=\r\nnbsp;Sri Ramkrishna, Sharda Maa and Swami Vivekanda&#39;s ashram. Hence the pil=\r\ngrims &amp; tourist inflow has increased by many folds but still the author=\r\nities are trying to maintain a clean atmosphere / surroundings as compared =\r\nto Kaalighat. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;Here too the priest are commercial minded but no=\r\nt as much obvious as in Kaalighat. The devotees do not get much time to hav=\r\ne the darshan of Maa due to the long crowd as well as your feet will burn i=\r\nf the sun is shining bright. But what I suggest is that just opposite to th=\r\ne temple is a open hall from where Maa Kaali can be seen clearly as Maa&#39;s i=\r\ndol is much elevated&nbsp; (please note that you will have to take about 20=\r\n steps to have her darshan). I sit in this hall and try to get a place wher=\r\ne I can see her clearly and then meditate once my system has absorbed her f=\r\null Rupa - a pleasant feeling. Forget the crowd around you and you can have=\r\n a good dialouge with Maa. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;After Maa&#39;s darshan walk down to th=\r\ne abode of Shri Ramkrishna , your mind will be so peaceful after the medita=\r\ntion - so much of positive energy around there. The next hop would be a ple=\r\nasant boat ride ( I prefer that as it make me close to mother nature - car =\r\nride is also possible)&nbsp;visit the Swami Vivekananda Ashram .

Narasimha once told me this could be\n due to karmic debts betwee=\r\nn people. I would like to extend the same to places, form of God/Goddess, t=\r\nemplate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was in Kolkota for 5 years. I went to Dakshines=\r\nwar several times but avoided visiting Kalighat even once. Why? I heard the=\r\n Kalighat is a red light area and you can meet broken with in template prem=\r\nises. Also, I heard, that the temple continues to have jantu bali and that =\r\nthe temple floor has animal blood flowing. These may be exaggerations, but,=\r\n I had developed a prejudice against the Kalighat temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nNow a days, I repent my narrow mindedness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My mental condi=\r\ntion between 1992-97 did not allow me to even consider going to Kalighat. M=\r\ny mental condition now will allow it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Our experiance may d=\r\nepend on our mental condition.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2. To perceive spiritual en=\r\nergy, we may have to have a karmic relation with that energy. We may need t=\r\no have matching wavelength to recieve the\n same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If I sit =\r\nin a place and here to the voices, I will understand messages in Telugu/Hin=\r\ndi/ English. How ever, if there is beautiful message in Oriya or some other=\r\n language, I may not perceive (I am not undermining Narasimha&#39;s ability to =\r\nperceive energy).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God is omni present.

While different places and times have some difference in the nature a=\r\nnd degree of spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime=\r\n, if the internal factors are conducive.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) Wha=\r\nt I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observation. Please b=\r\near in mind that any observation is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat =\r\nhas similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simp=\r\nly failed to perceive it. What\n we are able to perceive and observe is also=\r\n based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother =\r\nis capable of deluding *anyone*.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But then, =\r\nwhat ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reaching God, is it not enough?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a=\r\n spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particul=\r\nar object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in tha=\r\nt idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on that specific form fast=\r\ner and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds=\r\n are separate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are abl=\r\ne to perceive in some vague form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are pr=\r\nesent in the ether.\n Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several=\r\n spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing th=\r\nat idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, there is some translation involved when thoughts of=\r\n one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This trans=\r\nlation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at=\r\n the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday o=\r\nf a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;=\r\ns control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then yo=\r\nu are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as some=\r\none who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothin=\r\ng bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol a=\r\ns a\n repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, please note that this principle works without an=\r\n idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench)=\r\n and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts ar=\r\ne present in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little susc=\r\neptible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little hig=\r\nher when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, please note that most people have some=\r\n devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they=\r\n are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and self=\r\nish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the=\r\n downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable=\r\n only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible\n prac=\r\ntices without understanding what they are doing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; is Idol worship risky?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that =\r\nI do not see any risk in idol worship.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; God created man as his replica. But the replica got c=\r\norrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the=\r\n mind with god, so that he can go back to the source and become free from t=\r\nhis cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not=\r\n able to create god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his =\r\ncurrent corrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep re=\r\nfining him and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When=\r\n one is pure and creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will match t=\r\nhe god that created man in the first place. When that god fills\n one&#39;s mind=\r\n, one is free from the cycle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about re=\r\nspected spiritual leaders of other religions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In=\r\n general, please remember that saying negative things about people that one=\r\n may not have understood fully or correctly is unwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; From time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world =\r\nto maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in t=\r\nhat part of the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual te=\r\nacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow tha=\r\nt person. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that person! I=\r\nf some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of =\r\nrealization, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we h=\r\nave not met physically or otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is =\r\nunhappy because of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi=\r\n or spiritual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct thin=\r\ngs and change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature an=\r\nd do your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on =\r\nthe cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarp=\r\nana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.\n yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://v=\r\nedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bl=\r\nank&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org=\r\n/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: raj=\r\narshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/c=\r\nompose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_blank=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, October 0=\r\n8, 2009 2:38 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nTo add to my query, a good number of religions explicitly prohibit idol wor=\r\nship. If the underlying truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I can understand that a Idol may contain a presence =\r\ncreated by human imagination which maynot have a divine link. Not everybody=\r\n is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali into an Idol.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ =\r\ncreative/ destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that =\r\nit is reaching God, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax collecte=\r\nr of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whethe=\r\nr a divine presence is there or not there\n infront?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; I would like to mention a small incident here about someone I know well=\r\n. There was a certain individual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he =\r\nwould take time out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at t=\r\nhe Kaalighat temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there t=\r\nrying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, =\r\nhe *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) -=\r\n but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become with=\r\nout thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world, everything was pe=\r\nrfect. Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to wors=\r\nhip the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he=\r\n walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty =\r\nroad but all he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in hi=\r\ns mind that night, except for an\n overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bo=\r\nttomline: a nice spiritual experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some mont=\r\nhs later he ended up meeting a very spiritual person who instructed him abo=\r\nut worshipping the Goddess. He strongly believes that night at the temple a=\r\nnd his meeting with the person was related. Interestingly, even that spirit=\r\nual person told him that there is probably no divine presence inside the id=\r\nol at Kaalighat temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Now my question is, if t=\r\nhe idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine presence why did this=\r\n person suddenly have such a nice meditation there? Does it mean that final=\r\nly it is only the devotion of the devotee which counts for spiritual energy=\r\n inside a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has any energy at all?&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi\n nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.m=\r\nc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow target=3D_blank&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date=\r\n: Thursday, 8 October, 2009, 8:24 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In this context of divine pressence,=\r\n is Idol worship risky?

However, eventually=\r\n the smell will be gone!

Even after the saint leaves that place=\r\n or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becom=\r\nes weak and disappears.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In many famous temples t=\r\nhese days, priests have become commercial and do not have the devotion need=\r\ned. The rituals performed every few years to re-energize the idols &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is my humble opinio=\r\nn that some famous\n temples do not have much divine presence today, though =\r\nI do not want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known =\r\ntemples seem to have a powerful divine presence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=\r\ne is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamala=\r\ni (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual ener=\r\ngy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically=\r\n alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the=\r\n Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression =\r\nat the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a =\r\npriest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we =\r\ndid the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple=\r\n before and\n it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of the div=\r\nine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand=\r\n it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and st=\r\narted meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vi=\r\nsion of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt =\r\nthat there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember =\r\nthe name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over =\r\nthe goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the=\r\n roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that =\r\nthe goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left=\r\n in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu p=\r\nrobably knows the name of the temple and goddess.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presen=\r\nce\n across India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at=\r\n Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krish=\r\nna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj i=\r\ns still meditating in the underground chamber there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even the middle of a busy road in Ind=\r\nia is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries a=\r\nre so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there i=\r\ns a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good p=\r\nlace to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temp=\r\nles. But some temples are really good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one ha=\r\ns a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I s=\r\nuggest the following:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Pu=\r\nri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam\n hill=\r\ns) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwar=\r\naka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and =\r\nHrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in centr=\r\nal India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are many other good places, but =\r\nthe above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying =\r\nthere for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a s=\r\npiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow t=\r\narget=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n S=\r\npirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;htt=\r\np://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blan=\r\nk&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yah=\r\noo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 =\r\n9:11 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I=\r\n would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in tod=\r\nay&#39;s time.
