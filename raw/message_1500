Even if one does not \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthink\n&gt; &gt; in those terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that one=\r\n can\n&gt; &gt; realize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more accu=\r\nrate\n&gt; &gt; statement would be that one can realize the highest truths without=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; engaging\n&gt; &gt; in any specific practices geared at awakening or raising=\r\n Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or=\r\n other raja/hatha\n&gt; &gt; yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. Howe=\r\nver, such practices \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini.=\r\n People belonging to various\n&gt; &gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to =\r\nHinduism, can experience \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; awakening, without knowing anyt=\r\nhing about the name or the symbolism. There\n&gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions=\r\n about Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini is essentia=\r\nlly the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and\n&gt; &gt; raised kundalini im=\r\nplies a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the lowest level=\r\n, we bind our selves to specific bodies and our\n&gt; &gt; self-awareness is limit=\r\ned to a body, a name and other things associated \n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; the body and=\r\n name. This experience of self as a body corresponds to\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini sleep=\r\ning at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the\n&gt; &gt; undifferentiated Se=\r\nlf, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This\n&gt; &gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self =\r\ncorresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As\n&gt; &gt; self-awareness goes from the =\r\nformer to the latter, it may traverse through\n&gt; &gt; many stages in between. C=\r\norrespondingly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first tim=\r\ne, like \n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes dow=\r\nn again and the\n&gt; &gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kunda=\r\nlini will work its\n&gt; &gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e=\r\n. undesirable\n&gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises hi=\r\ngh at the time of\n&gt; &gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and y=\r\net rise high through\n&gt; &gt; the impurities. This may manifest physically as a =\r\npowerful experience\n&gt; &gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path=\r\n taken\n&gt; &gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may=\r\n change \n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; person to person, based on the impurities in various =\r\nnadis. The exact\n&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed=\r\n and the final point\n&gt; &gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before with=\r\ndrawal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, ris=\r\ne to Sahasrara\n&gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. =\r\nHis nadis had\n&gt; &gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he direct=\r\nly went into\n&gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully =\r\nrealized person.\n&gt; &gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sayi=\r\nng &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The\n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\nact experience changes from person to person, depending on the path\n&gt; &gt; tra=\r\nversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not h=\r\nave any\n&gt; &gt; confusion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening o=\r\nccurs, one\n&gt; &gt; may confuse various other experiences (such as some movement=\r\n of vayu in\n&gt; &gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think tha=\r\nt kundalini is\n&gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sensation =\r\nlike ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are \n&gt; &gt; NOT\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little vaayu\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nflowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a\n&gt; &gt; gua=\r\nrantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the\n&gt; &gt; sensat=\r\nion of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sensation\n&gt; &gt; of=\r\n having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting normally in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nreality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a reference, I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He=\r\n was\n&gt; &gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a fe=\r\nw months\n&gt; &gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. Howeve=\r\nr, he had\n&gt; &gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninfor=\r\nmed about\n&gt; &gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specif=\r\nic raja/hatha\n&gt; &gt; yoga practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect=\r\n and eyes closed\n&gt; &gt; and meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before k=\r\nundalini awakening, \n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; started experiencing various premonitory si=\r\ngns. He guru told him not to be\n&gt; &gt; distracted by them and to keep the focu=\r\ns on the mantra and try to forget\n&gt; &gt; everything else. When mind starts dwe=\r\nlling on an experience, it gets stuck\n&gt; &gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; When he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n focused\n&gt; &gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly =\r\nhe became\n&gt; &gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was a really tremendous=\r\n explosion at\n&gt; &gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of=\r\n electric current\n&gt; &gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it felt li=\r\nke he was not a body\n&gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he was going =\r\nup like a rocket at a\n&gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a t=\r\nremendously bright white\n&gt; &gt; light and there was nothing else. It felt like=\r\n he was not a small point in\n&gt; &gt; that light, but he was the light itself. T=\r\nhere was an undescribable sense \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, =\r\nfrom nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this?\n&gt; &gt; What happened to my body? I=\r\n have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became\n&gt; &gt; aware of himself as a bod=\r\ny sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room\n&gt; &gt; and went out, he felt =\r\ngreat love for everyone and happiness. For example, \n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; serial was c=\r\noming on TV and characters in the serial that he normally\n&gt; &gt; disliked for =\r\ntheir shallow personalities suddenly felt like real people \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; he =\r\nhad great love and compassion for those TV serial characters (and other\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n real people too). That state of love and compassion lasted a while and \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This short experience was only the beginn=\r\ning of a journey. He experienced\n&gt; &gt; many things later on. These experience=\r\ns were different from each other. As \n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; said earlier, the experienc=\r\ne varies based on the path traversed and the\n&gt; &gt; point reached by the self-=\r\nawareness (kundalini). On various occasions,\n&gt; &gt; kundalini rose and he saw =\r\nseveral sights and several beings within and \n&gt; &gt; heard\n&gt; &gt; several sounds,=\r\n including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He realize=\r\nd the transientness of a lot that we cling on to and the \n&gt; &gt; existence\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n of something far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All this slowly starte=\r\nd to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards\n&gt; &gt; and he critically s=\r\ntarted to analyze his own thoughts and motives and \n&gt; &gt; worked\n&gt; &gt; on corre=\r\ncting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him,\n&gt; &gt; what o=\r\nthers did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him.\n&gt; &gt; Luc=\r\nkily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that \n&gt; &gt; kundal=\r\nini\n&gt; &gt; awakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Dependi=\r\nng on\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or even =\r\nlives.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini awakening is only a be=\r\nginning. It is not an end. Even the rise \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; kundalini to a chakra =\r\nis not an end. In fact, a big percentage of people\n&gt; &gt; with awakened kundal=\r\nini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very \n&gt; &gt; few\n&gt; &gt; make it to=\r\n the next chakra or the one after, but end up getting stuck \n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Very very few make it to higher chakras. And a very small minority \n&gt; &gt; ac=\r\ntually\n&gt; &gt; realise self.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sthita praj=\r\nnataa described by Sri Krishna \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real en=\r\nd goal of sadhana, whether you are into \n&gt; &gt; raja\n&gt; &gt; yoga or karma yoga or=\r\n bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical\n&gt; &gt; experience can only=\r\n distract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, \n&gt; &gt; especially\n&gt; &gt; those wh=\r\no respect my advice, to forget about kundalini and chakras and \n&gt; &gt; just\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; keep doing homam and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npurifying themselves with sadhana, keep working on their attitude and\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhought process and keep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; purified and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; WILL\n&gt; &gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalin=\r\ni and \n&gt; &gt; mystical\n&gt; &gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather than a boost,=\r\n in one&#39;s spiritual\n&gt; &gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini,=\r\n try to manipulate the\n&gt; &gt; way your mind works and perfect your self-contro=\r\nl. Kundalini will\n&gt; &gt; automatically follow. One will do well to remember th=\r\nese words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 P=\r\nM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Relevant to this on going subject, i remember reading autobiography of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Shri\n&gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Ku=\r\nndalini\n&gt; &gt; Awakening is not mandatory for realization.

When one attains a perfect focus on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra and=\r\n distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lungs/stoma=\r\nch and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana a=\r\nnd apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion=\r\n within one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freed\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exist. This is similar to death, excep=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel a kind=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s fo=\r\ncus on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and =\r\nstarts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of on=\r\ne becoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused.

The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the per=\r\nson care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is mini=\r\nmised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remem=\r\nber, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana=\r\n). After the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the r=\r\nealm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to =\r\na separate realm reserved for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Attack=\r\ning such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heads\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detrimen=\r\nt(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with h=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this =\r\nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like =\r\nyou \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of t=\r\nhis from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes lat=\r\ner. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe=\r\n and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you=\r\n, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identificat=\r\nion, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti=\r\n possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Sh=\r\nakti which can be used, moreover=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects=\r\n will not be free of identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so t=\r\nheir actions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. T=\r\nhese people usually join the same spirits which they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbeen using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagin=\r\ne if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eve=\r\nn in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmay acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in th=\r\nis lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are=\r\n crucial and may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Acc=\r\nording to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nuggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on som=\r\ne good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=\r\n=C2 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constr=\r\naints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same materia=\r\nls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nCount on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restra=\r\nint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce f=\r\nood intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make s=\r\nure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this f=\r\nor 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference=\r\n in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is imp=\r\nortant is that life may be short, so do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and =\r\npersist with that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may =\r\npost this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that t=\r\nhis is suitable.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
