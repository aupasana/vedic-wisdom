Paramahamsa Yogananda is a great yogi and a person with a high level o=\r\nf realization, who came to earth for a specific mission and executed it so =\r\nwell.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If somebody quoting him is saying &quot;fancy&quot; things, please realiz=\r\ne that it may be due to misunderstanding by that person. For example, even =\r\nPatanjali was being quoted and misused earlier, based on a misunderstanding=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is pure and ready, just a single book by a good author may b=\r\ne sufficient to give perfect knowledge. But, otherwise, even a really good =\r\nbook may not stop one from forming some wrong notions. Of course, reading m=\r\nultiple good books may give a better perspective. However, let us not expli=\r\ncitly or implicitly put down any good book or author here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I want to make a philosophical comment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Take a simple=\r\n question: What is the purpose of debate in a matter relating to knowledge =\r\nand when is a debate over?\n&gt;  \n&gt; One with kshatriya temperament may want to=\r\n assert one&#39;s supremacy and correctness and may want to see the opponent kn=\r\neel down and accept defeat. Such a debater may sometimes get personal and p=\r\nass personal remarks that are dismissive or condescending or disparaging in=\r\n nature/tone.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, one with braahmana temperament does not care about=\r\n assertions of supremacy, victory, defeat etc. Such a debater only wants co=\r\nrrect knowledge to be spread and wrong knowledge to be contained, to the be=\r\nst of one&#39;s limited ability. Such a debater will stay away from personal co=\r\nmments, focus on the subject matter and make only those comments that promo=\r\nte further understanding and clarification of knowledge. If, for example, t=\r\nhe opponent changes his/her stand in the middle of the debate without ackno=\r\nwledging his/her mistake and accepting defeat, it will not be a big deal fo=\r\nr a braahmana debater. As long as wrong knowledge is contained, the purpose=\r\n of the debate is served! There is no need to put down the person. Moreover=\r\n, a true braahmana debater will display the same braahmana qualities *even =\r\nwhen* he/she is confronted by a kshatriya debater.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;d love to see so=\r\nme learned members develop a braahmana attitude to debating here. Spiritual=\r\n knowledge is essentially a braahminical pursuit and let us maintain a braa=\r\nhminical attitude in it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Check below.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The upsurg=\r\ne (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 4/10/09=\r\n, yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gyan Marga\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, 4 October, 2009, 4:45 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your contribution - all you have=\r\n done is to prove what is already known.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You had already, during y=\r\nou very first mail stated that everything is already known.  So then why ar=\r\ne you wastingme here? -:)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in bey=\r\nond the death for a normal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; human being. Therewfore, Ahamkara is pres=\r\nent in the astral/casual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; plane as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Do you realize w=\r\nhat is being talked about and what you have ended up proving ? \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; M=\r\naybe, most people here realize it better than you do! Thats what makes your=\r\n statements sound so incorrigible funny to say the least.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Wherein=\r\n did I deny that Ahamkara is not present in Astral/Causal bodies ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n You did deny it quite vehemently. Kindly check yourolder mails. You make a=\r\n statement A then in the course of discussion you conveniently change it to=\r\n B and then jump around assuming ridiculous airs. At least, try and remembe=\r\nr what you yourself speak. Go back and re check you own mails here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Why is Ahamkara not dominant in Astral/Causal bodies ?\n&gt; &gt; The reason I h=\r\nave already given in the first mail in sufficient detail.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thats a=\r\ngain your assumption. Ahamkara is indeed a dominant force in all planes unt=\r\nill one reaches a state beyond ego.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  BRING IT BACK AT REBIRTH TO T=\r\nHE EARTH. AND THEN, HE WILL RECLAIM HIS LOST TERRITORY AND WEALTH - THE CON=\r\nFLICTS THAT WILL ARISE WILL BE BEYOND ANYBODY&#39;S CONTROL. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This sh=\r\nows that you have not understood even 1 percent of what has been told to yo=\r\nu till now by other in this forum, maybe because you have already decided t=\r\no close your mind.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ahamkara is NOT confied to acquiring or not ac=\r\nquiring of weath. THE specifics will depend on the law of karma. The essent=\r\nial sense of I-ness will very much remain in ALL planes, the speciifcs gets=\r\n filled in by karmic repurcussions and desires.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; THUS, THE BEAUTIF=\r\nUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS, while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE=\r\n SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Any I-ness is Ahamkara. Period.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i Sri Paramahansa Yogananda&quot;, he has mentioned about all these thi=\r\nngs (what happens to a soul at death and so on) in such a simplistic manner=\r\n in his Gita commentaries, that even a layman can understand it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIs that the only book you have based all your fancy ideas on?
