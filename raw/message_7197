The life of Brahma is 120 divine yea=\r\nrs called Mahakalpa. Everyday he creates 14 Manus one by one and they creat=\r\ne and control the world. So there are fourteen Manus in one divine day call=\r\ned Kalpa of Brahma. The life of each Manu is called Manvantara and it has 7=\r\n1 eras of four quarters. Each quarter is has four Yugas - Krita or Satya, T=\r\nreta, Dvapara and Kali. The following are the complete calculations of Vedi=\r\nc units of time and periods.\n\nThe time taken to tear apart the softest peta=\r\nls of a lotus is called &#39;TRUTI&#39; \n100 Trutis make 1 Lub\n30 Lub make 1 Nimesh=\r\n\n27 Nimesh make 1 Guru Akshar\n10 Guru Akshar Make 1 Pran\n6 pran Vighatika m=\r\nake 1 Ghatika or Dand\n60 Ghati make 1 day and night \n\nThat means, in a day =\r\nand night, there are 17,49,60,000,00 Trutis\nThus, according to Western scie=\r\nnce, there are 86,400 seconds in a day and night, whereas in Indian science=\r\n, a day and night consists of 17,49,60,000,00 Trutis. \n\nAccording to anothe=\r\nr system, the division of time is\n\n1 day or 24 hours =3D 60 Ghatis\n1 Ghati =\r\n=3D 60 Vighati (also called Pala or Kala)\n1 Vighati =3D 60 Lipta or (also c=\r\nalled Vipala or Vikala)\n1 Lipta =3D 60 Vilipta\n1 Vilipta =3D 60 Para\n1 Para=\r\n =3D 60 Tatpara\n\nAs a lot of charts made in the olden days mention the birt=\r\nh time in Ghatis and Vighatis the following is the conversion to remember:\n=\r\n\n5 Ghatis =3D 2 hours\n5 Vighati =3D 2 minutes\nAnother system of time at mic=\r\nro level is\n60 Tatparas =3D 1 Paras\n60 Paras =3D 1 Vilipta\n60 Vilipta =3D 1=\r\n Lipta\n60 Lipta =3D 1 Ghatika (Dand)\n60 Ghatika =3D 1 Day & Night)\n\nTherefo=\r\nre, it is clear that there are 46,65,60,000,00 Tatparas in a day and night.=\r\n\n\n6.3.

The present period is pass=\r\ning through the seventh Manvantara called Vaivaswata Manvantara.\nOne Manvan=\r\ntara consists of 71 Mahayugs, out of which 27 Mahayugs have already passed.=\r\n We are passing through the first phase of the Kali Yuga which itself is th=\r\ne third Yuga of the 28th Mahayuga and which has come after the passing of S=\r\natya Yuga, Treta and Dwapar Yuga. \nThe time period of Manvantara (exclusive=\r\n period, when the earth is submerged in water, in the beginning and in the =\r\nend) =3D 306,720,000 years \n1) Multiplying these years by 6 =3D 30,67,20,00=\r\n0 x 6 (Because we are in the midst of 7th Manvantara, of the Svetvaaraah Ka=\r\nlpa and 6 Manvantaras have already passed) =3D 1,8,0,300,000 years \nThe tim=\r\ne period of Pralaya consists of 17,28,000 years since 7 Pralayas have passe=\r\nd, after the end of 6th Kalpa and before the beginning of 7th Kalpa, so 17,=\r\n28,000x 7 =3D 12,096,000 years \nAdding we have:\n1,840,300,000 + 120 96 000 =\r\n+ 1,852,396,000 years\nTherefore, after 1,85,24,16,000 years &#39;VAIVASVAT MANV=\r\nANTARA&#39; has started.\n\n2) 27 Mahayugs with each Mahayuga consisting of 43,20=\r\n,000 years. 43,20,000 x 27 =3D 116,640,000 years have passed\nTotal =3D 1,96=\r\n,90,56,000 years \n3) Now the time period of Kali Yuga in the 28th Yuga =3D =\r\n\nTime period of Satya Yuga =3D 17,28,000\nTime period of Treta =3D 12,96,000=\r\n\nTime period of Dwapar =3D 8,64,000\nTOTAL =3D 38,88,000\nSince all the above=\r\n three Yugas have already passed, it means that after 38,88,000 years, Kali=\r\n Yuga came into existence. \n4) Kali Yuga started on Bhadrapada, Krishnapaks=\r\nha -13th day, in Vyatipaat yoga at midnight, in the Aashlesha Nakshatra and=\r\n the age of the Kali Yuga has been fixed as 5101 years as till date that is=\r\n Vikram Samvat 2057 =3D Shaka 1922 =3D 2000 AD. \nSum of all the three Yugs =\r\n=3D the Sum of 27 Mahayugas and Manvantar + the time period of Kali Yuga ti=\r\nll date.\n\nKalpa consist of 4,32,00,00,000 years and out of these 1,97,29,49=\r\n,101 years have passed. Therefore, the earth&#39;s existence, according to the =\r\ncalculations devised by our ancient sages, comes up to 1,97,29,49,101 years=\r\n till date. It is interesting to note that according to scientific calculat=\r\nions, the age of the cosmos is estimated between 15 and 20 billion years. \n=\r\n\nIndia has given the idea of the smallest and the largest measure of time.\n=\r\nKrati =3D 34,000th of a second\n1 Truti =3D 300th of a second\n2 Truti =3D 1 =\r\nLuv \n2 Luv =3D 1 Kshana\n30 Kshana =3D 1 Vipal\n60 Vipal =3D 1 Pal\n60 Pal =3D=\r\n 1 Ghadi (24 minutes)\n2.5 Gadhi =3D 1 Hora (1 hour)\n24 Hora =3D 1 Divas (1 =\r\nday)\n7 Divas =3D 1 saptaah (1 week)\n4 Saptaah =3D 1 Maas (1 month)\n2 Maas =\r\n=3D 1 Rutu (1 season)\n6 Rutu =3D 1 Varsh (1 year)\n100 Varsh =3D 1 Shataabda=\r\n (1 century)\n10 Shataabda =3D 1 sahasraabda\n432 Sahasraabda =3D 1 Yug (Kali=\r\nyug)\n2 Yug =3D 1 Dwaaparyug\n3 Yug =3D 1 Tretaayug\n4 Yug =3D 1 Krutayug\n10 Y=\r\nug =3D 1 Mahaayug (4,320,000 years)\n1000 Mahaayug =3D 1 Kalpa\n1 Kalpa =3D 4=\r\n.32 billion years \n\nPS: The Vedic calculations of Time & creation\nCompiled =\r\nby Dr.A.P.Rao\n\n\nRegards,\nSrini.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; It has no real religious=\r\n reason.
