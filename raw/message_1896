Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I mentioned my guru Dr Manis=\r\nh Pandit and the command of the Divine Mother\n&gt; when she appeared before hi=\r\nm in March 2006 regarding teaching simple homam\n&gt; procedures to people. I w=\r\nant to mention a small story about his past. This\n&gt; is an incident that had=\r\n a profound impact on his spiritual evolution in this\n&gt; life.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt;\n&gt; When Manish was young, he was not exactly spiritual. His mot=\r\nher was highly\n&gt; spiritual and religious and he naturally knew some prayers=\r\n, but did not do\n&gt; much spiritual sadhana. He would race motor bikes outsid=\r\ne Pune with friends\n&gt; and lead a licentious lifestyle.\n&gt;\n&gt; When in college,=\r\n he got bad marks in one subject in exams and wanted to go\n&gt; to college one=\r\nday to fight and increase his marks. When he was about to\n&gt; leave house, a =\r\nteenaged Brahmin in orange clothes and having good tejas in\n&gt; face came to =\r\nhis house. He asked Manish where he was going. He then said,\n&gt; &quot;do not go o=\r\nut today. Going out today will ruin your life. Just stay home\n&gt; and think o=\r\nf god. I will make sure that your marks with be increased. Leave\n&gt; it to me=\r\n and don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He then strongly suggested to Manish\n&gt; that he =\r\nshould wear a diamond ring on his right hand index finger and it\n&gt; would ch=\r\nange his life. Interestingly, Manish has Meena lagna and Venus is a\n&gt; malef=\r\nic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th house) with 3 other planets,\n&gt; pe=\r\nople would normally avoid diamond in this case to be safe. Moreover, most\n&gt;=\r\n people do not put diamond on index finger, which is associated with Jupite=\r\nr,\n&gt; an enemy of Venus. So nobody would normally recommend him diamond, tha=\r\nt too\n&gt; on the index finger. This is an unusual suggestion.\n&gt;\n&gt; That brahmi=\r\nn boy then asked Manish to give him tea or sugar with his hand\n&gt; and said t=\r\nhat this act would do him good. There was no tea at their house\n&gt; and Manis=\r\nh fed him some sugar. He ate it and left after saying, &quot;when you\n&gt; come to =\r\nShirdi next, come to so and so room in so and so place. That is\n&gt; where I l=\r\nive. Also, I need to give a glass of water to your mother. Please\n&gt; come to=\r\n Shirdi with her.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Barely a minute after he lef=\r\nt, Manish had a question and ran to the door of\n&gt; his compound wall. He fou=\r\nnd no person in orange clothes walking on the road.\n&gt; He asked the persons =\r\nstanding outside whether they could tell him in which\n&gt; direction a person =\r\nwho came out of the house in orange clothes had gone.\n&gt; They said nobody we=\r\nnt in or came out of the house in an hour. Manish went\n&gt; around the area to=\r\n check if anybody saw a young Brahmin in orange clothes.\n&gt; Nobody in that a=\r\nrea saw anyone like that. So this seemed like a miracle.\n&gt; Manish was puzzl=\r\ned.\n&gt;\n&gt; Later his marks in the exam were automatically increased and his pr=\r\noblem\n&gt; was solved by itself, without his doing anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt;\n&gt; A few months later, they went to Shirdi. They wanted to meet tha=\r\nt young\n&gt; Brahmin. They went to the place he mentioned. Manish&#39;s mother was=\r\n waiting\n&gt; downstairs and they went upstairs to the room number mentioned b=\r\ny him to\n&gt; find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody in that room and there =\r\nwas a life\n&gt; size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wall. When they asked, th=\r\ney were told\n&gt; that that room had always been empty and only the picture wa=\r\ns there. Nobody\n&gt; ever lived in that room.\n&gt;\n&gt; When they came downstairs, M=\r\nanish&#39;s mother told them that she suddenly\n&gt; became very thirsty and a youn=\r\ng man in white clothes came, made her drink\n&gt; some water from his hands and=\r\n left in a hurry.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; After this, Manish did buy a =\r\ndiamond ring as suggested by the\n&gt; divine visitor and wore it on his right =\r\nhand index finger. He still wears\n&gt; it. Perhaps wearing a strong moksha tri=\r\nkona lord&#39;s gem on the moksha finger\n&gt; (the four fingers represent the 4 pu=\r\nrusharthas and thumb shows self)\n&gt; strengthens moksha trikona. Though this =\r\nwas an unusual (and risky)\n&gt; suggestion, perhaps this is very appropriate i=\r\nn this case for spiritual\n&gt; progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Soon after this, another miraculo=\r\nus incident involving a deity happened,\n&gt; which I do not want to mention no=\r\nw. Then started his spiritual\n&gt; transformation. Manish became very serious =\r\nabout spiritual sadhana after\n&gt; that and started spending many hours everyd=\r\nay in spiritual sadhana. He had\n&gt; visions - internal and external - of many=\r\n deities and special beings,\n&gt; including Shirdi Sai Baba too, and had many =\r\nexperiences. His life changed\n&gt; completely after this experience.\n&gt;\n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Today many people do not believe that miraculous and mag=\r\nical things can\n&gt; happen. When they hear unbelievable stories about saints =\r\nlike Sai Baba,\n&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami=\r\n, Mahavatar\n&gt; Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds trained in r=\r\national\n&gt; thinking assume that the stories are made up by someone. Healthy =\r\nskepticism\n&gt; is justified because many fake people are there today, who abu=\r\nse people&#39;s\n&gt; faith. However, absolute cynicism is wrong. Such things *are =\r\n*possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; But one word on miracles and siddhis. Miracles and siddhis a=\r\nre secondary to\n&gt; self-realization. The important thing is to do spiritual =\r\nsadhana, realize\n&gt; self, and live as a liberated person (jeevanmukta) conti=\r\nnuing to discharge\n&gt; the job assigned to one by Nature, with an equanimous =\r\nmind and neither\n&gt; attraction nor repulsion to anything. Nature assigns dif=\r\nferent jobs to\n&gt; different persons. Personalities like Sai Baba, Ramana Mah=\r\narshi, Raghavendra\n&gt; Swami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar =\r\nMaharaj, Trilinga\n&gt; Swami, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramanujacharya, Madhwachar=\r\nya, Adi Shankara etc\n&gt; did *different *jobs on this earth, but what is comm=\r\non between them is\n&gt; that they completely overcame their limited personalit=\r\nies, became realized\n&gt; and then went on to fulfill the tasks given to them =\r\nby the Power that runs\n&gt; the universe, with an equanimous mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0015174be26a05f90b046b42de90\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear Narsimha Garu,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simply wonderful.

He had visions=C2=A0- internal and \nexternal=C2=A0- of ma=\r\nny deities and special beings, including Shirdi Sai Baba \ntoo,=C2=A0and had=\r\n many experiences. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;His life \nchanged=\r\n completely after this experience.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Today many people do not believe t=\r\nhat miraculous \nand magical things can happen. When they hear unbelievable =\r\nstories about saints \nlike Sai Baba, Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa, Trilinga Swami, \nMahavatar Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern=\r\n minds trained in rational \nthinking assume that the stories are made up by=\r\n someone. Healthy skepticism is \njustified because many fake people are the=\r\nre today, who abuse people&#39;s faith. \nHowever, absolute cynicism is wron=\r\ng. Such things &lt;i&gt;are \n&lt;/i&gt;possible.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;But on=\r\ne word on miracles and siddhis. Miracles and \nsiddhis are secondary to self=\r\n-realization. The important thing is to do \nspiritual sadhana, realize self=\r\n, and live as a liberated person \n(jeevanmukta)=C2=A0continuing to discharg=\r\ne the job assigned to one by Nature, \nwith an equanimous mind and neither a=\r\nttraction nor repulsion to anything. Nature \nassigns different jobs to diff=\r\nerent persons. Personalities like Sai Baba, Ramana \nMaharshi, Raghavendra S=\r\nwami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar \nMaharaj, Trilinga Swa=\r\nmi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramanujacharya, Madhwacharya, Adi \nShankara etc d=\r\nid &lt;i&gt;different &lt;/i&gt;jobs on this earth, but what is common \nbetween them is=\r\n that they completely overcame their limited personalities, \nbecame realize=\r\nd and then went on to fulfill the tasks given to them by the Power \nthat ru=\r\nns the universe, with an equanimous mind.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2=\r\n&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;B=\r\nest \nregards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------&lt;br&gt;Do \na Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do \nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: \n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free=\r\n \nJyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free \nJyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri \nJagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJ=\r\nagannath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------- \n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n    \n    &lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white=\r\n; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0015174be26a05f90b046b42de90--\r\n\n"}}
