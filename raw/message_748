The instruction was to spread homam and create a community of=\r\n sadhakas across the world who worship various deities in fire. It can be a=\r\nny deities.\n \n2. The beauty of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sens=\r\ne of discipline in one. Even 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting =\r\nbefore or after.\n \nKavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas and moo=\r\nla mantra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and devi sookt=\r\nam are recommended after.\n \nHowever, in my humble opinion, nothing is reall=\r\ny compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be very powerful afte=\r\nr a while. I see nothing wrong in it.\n \n3. Both are correct and work differ=\r\nently. However, those who try who pronounce the beeja mantras as &quot;aing hree=\r\nng&quot; invariably misponounce them. The &quot;g&quot; becomes explicit. Ideally, you sho=\r\nuld start pronouncing as though you are going to say &quot;aing&quot; and abruptly st=\r\nop just when you are about to say &quot;g&quot;, without saying it. It is not easy to=\r\n pronounce this correctly.\n \nInstead of trying &quot;aing hreeng&quot; and messing it=\r\n up, it is better to just say &quot;aim hreem&quot;.\n \n*        *        *\n \nInternal=\r\n purity and lack (or minimization) of individualized ego is the key in any =\r\nsadhana. Thousands of hours of sadhana without them is fruitless. One who i=\r\ns pure and has a very limited ego achieves results quickly.\n \nThere is a lo=\r\nt of misinformation and unfounded fears that are spread regarding Chandi pa=\r\nth. Do not worry about them.\n \nEating an elaborate set of appetizers and de=\r\nsserts before and after a meal may be recommended. But one can get indigest=\r\nion from it too. If the meal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy =\r\nit without appetizers or dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and posi=\r\ntively to get the most energy from it. Similarly, read whatever you read wi=\r\nth a sense of surrender and limited ego.\n \nInstead of doing everything with=\r\n a lower focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focus.\n \n=\r\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/h=\r\nomam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://w=\r\nww.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ashwin Rawal \n  To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 6:51 AM\n  S=\r\nubject: [vedic-wisdom] Maha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam\n\n\n        Dear Nars=\r\nimhaji\n        1.Since I have joined this group before some couple of month=\r\ns, some previous mails I have not read.

I would like to know=\r\n whether it was for Maha Ganapati Homam too or only Chandi Homam?,\n        =\r\n2.Please also guide me whether really we should read Chandi Path or Sapta S=\r\nati Stotra with Devi Kavacha, Argala, Kilak and Ratri Suktam before 13 Adhy=\r\nayas and Devi Sukta, etc in the end ? Suppose we recite only 13 Adhyayas on=\r\nly after Sankalpam-will it not be sufficient in daily routine worship? Or i=\r\nt is compulsory?\n        3.

However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until much=\r\n later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to do ho=\r\nmam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.\n\n          =\r\nI experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I start=\r\ned doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months,=\r\n I finally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to wri=\r\nte a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct cho=\r\nice, as many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the m=\r\nanual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). Howev=\r\ner, as far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was =\r\ntime for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started=\r\n with him. What a fortunate soul..\n\n          * * *\n\n          It was proba=\r\nbly for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the M=\r\nother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would&#39;ve been different=\r\n while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurrie=\r\nd more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my s=\r\nweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without ma=\r\nny pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really =\r\nbenefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have h=\r\nad more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the =\r\nsame progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.\n\n  =\r\n        Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to ha=\r\nndle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manua=\r\nl as asked by him then.\n\n          * * *\n\n          A good guru protects a =\r\nsishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I re=\r\nmember another incident.\n\n          One day in the spring of the same year,=\r\n I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the c=\r\noming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latche=\r\nd on to it. When I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I =\r\nstarted before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2=\r\n min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min =\r\nbreak for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place a=\r\nnd meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in =\r\na very nice state at the end of the day.\n\n          I noticed on the next d=\r\nay that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It=\r\n is considered a very auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadh=\r\nana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I ha=\r\nd not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was exci=\r\nted. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he s=\r\naid calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowin=\r\ng it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadh=\r\nana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental foc=\r\nus and brought more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;\n\n          He was absolutely r=\r\night. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride bro=\r\nught rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that =\r\nI was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride=\r\n and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra =\r\nfurther. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent pro=\r\ngress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s wor=\r\nds, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and th=\r\nat he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!\n\n          Lucky ar=\r\ne those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather t=\r\nhan what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who=\r\n can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can we=\r\ned it out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious eff=\r\nort.\n\n          * * *\n\n          I remember one more similar incident. Befo=\r\nre the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me =\r\nto a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned=\r\n the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and th=\r\nat I would do some important work in this birth.\n\n          When I saw Mani=\r\nsh later that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious a=\r\nnd said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already stro=\r\nng with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the =\r\nastrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; e=\r\ntc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Se=\r\nlf. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another =\r\nnew identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be c=\r\norrect. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all =\r\nidentities.&quot;\n\n          How true and wise!\n\n          * * *\n\n          Just=\r\n as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the f=\r\nood given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins =\r\nover the spirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a g=\r\nood master may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too mu=\r\nst consciously try to restrain ego and increase detachment.\n\n          Mani=\r\nsh has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points he made bro=\r\nught so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in t=\r\nhis life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritua=\r\nl gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp=\r\n and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that=\r\n was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off th=\r\ne thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that enclo=\r\nses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caug=\r\nht up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n\n          * * *\n\n          Homam and=\r\n other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also try to=\r\n introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no mag=\r\nic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or day or=\r\n month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should s=\r\ntart walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the distance =\r\nleft. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.\n\n    =\r\n      The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homa=\r\nm) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in ha=\r\nnd. After a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start t=\r\no work together very effectively.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasi=\r\nmha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ h=\r\nomam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. =\r\nnet\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\n\n          ---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n     =\r\n     &gt; Namaste Friends,\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Some ramblings ...\n       =\r\n   &gt; \n          &gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything similar =\r\nto it), it\n          &gt; happens with all beginners and its only practice whi=\r\nch makes one\n          &gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with=\r\n\n          &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path for m=\r\nost. \n          &gt; \n          &gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s =\r\nspiritual Guru whom I also\n          &gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we =\r\nwere in Chennai for Shata Chandi\n          &gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi ho=\r\nmam, I thought he was really joking!\n          &gt; When I got back to the US,=\r\n he called me again and reminded me. It then\n          &gt; occured to me he w=\r\nas really being serious. So, I started searching on\n          &gt; the net and=\r\n I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took\n          &gt; it u=\r\np and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then\n          &gt; rem=\r\ninded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely\n       =\r\n   &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between\n =\r\n         &gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasio=\r\nnally\n          &gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated=\r\n in it, but\n          &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to gui=\r\nde me, which he\n          &gt; did, but still it did not get through my really=\r\n dense brains :). I\n          &gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were su=\r\nch that I never gave up,\n          &gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lor=\r\nd Ganesha, that If he really\n          &gt; intends that I perform the homa, t=\r\nhen he should kindly show me the\n          &gt; way. In around two weeks time,=\r\n Narasimha told me that he has decided\n          &gt; to document the Laghu (S=\r\nhort) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt\n          &gt; believe my luck and =\r\nthanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\n          &gt; grace. Well ... =\r\nits been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n          &gt; baby-steps an=\r\nd making progress everyday.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; I thank Manishji, Nara=\r\nsimha and the all the divine forces for helping\n          &gt; me progress.\n  =\r\n        &gt; \n          &gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no =\r\nmatter what. We\n          &gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobo=\r\ndy got perfect the very\n          &gt; first time, unless he has worked on it =\r\na lot in his previous lives.\n          &gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry ab=\r\nout time, we have future lives ...\n          &gt; plenty of time. These things=\r\n take their own sweet time, doesnt happen\n          &gt; overnight. No matter =\r\nwhat, complete your homa everyday, that should be\n          &gt; the primary g=\r\noal ... nothing else.

Let me give an analogy.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Thi=\r\nnk of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \n          &gt; &gt; se=\r\nrvant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the \n          &gt; =\r\n&gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve your \n    =\r\n      &gt; &gt; master.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be v=\r\nery wealthy and have many big checks \n          &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and al=\r\nso many big checks everyday to mail others. \n          &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need=\r\n a servant to physically carry papers to the bank and \n          &gt; &gt; do the=\r\n needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this \n          &gt; =\r\n&gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this \n  =\r\n        &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and =\r\n\n          &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then.=\r\n The \n          &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various phys=\r\nical persons \n          &gt; &gt; present on earth.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try \n    =\r\n      &gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant car=\r\nries \n          &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n =\r\n         &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good w=\r\nork tends to promote ego \n          &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A =\r\nservant carrying a million dollar \n          &gt; &gt; check to the bank and cash=\r\ning it is NOT superior to a servant \n          &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to=\r\n the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n          &gt; &gt; doing their master=\r\n&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n          &gt; &gt; *instruments*=\r\n used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, \n          &gt; &gt; one =\r\nwho does what are considered great deeds in this world and one \n          &gt;=\r\n &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n      =\r\n    &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n  =\r\n        &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior=\r\n to \n          &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior =\r\nby the world, \n          &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who=\r\n considers \n          &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carry=\r\ning something less \n          &gt; &gt; valuable.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s \n      =\r\n    &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n     =\r\n     &gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy =\r\nand \n          &gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism a=\r\nnd in light \n          &gt; &gt; and darkness.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nave the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam.

Can a homam\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made =\r\nby arranging red bricks, with sand base be \n          &gt; &gt; used instead of a=\r\n\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you ca=\r\nn do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \n          &gt; &gt; actually bette=\r\nr than doing it in closed space. But realize that a \n          &gt; &gt; rain can=\r\n cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire \n          &gt; &gt;=\r\n if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n        =\r\n  &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n     =\r\n     &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n     =\r\n     &gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  =\r\n        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along w=\r\nith the audio?\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally whi=\r\nle listening attentively (not \n          &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even list=\r\nening to mantras with all the attention \n          &gt; &gt; focused is as powerf=\r\nul as saying mantras.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is =\r\nchanting a mantra and thinking of \n          &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the=\r\n mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n          &gt; &gt; with focus and th=\r\ninking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n          &gt; &gt; may do n=\r\nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n          &gt; &gt; ma=\r\nntra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n       =\r\n   &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra=\r\n.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between m=\r\neditation and \n          &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fir=\r\ne in meditation and it \n          &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as =\r\nwell in a homam. So making some \n          &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeb=\r\nle) is a good idea as opposed to silent \n          &gt; &gt; chanting or just lis=\r\ntening. Try to repeat slowly.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bach=\r\nelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n          &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas t=\r\nhat\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?=\r\n\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thr=\r\nead ceremony) \n          &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or marr=\r\nied is irrelevant.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the y=\r\namas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n          &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s gur=\r\nu sets, one should follow them \n          &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one=\r\n should eat only vegetarian food on the \n          &gt; &gt; day of homam and tak=\r\ne a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n          &gt; &gt; recommend is to a=\r\nvoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n         =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n          &gt; =\r\n&gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and \n  =\r\n        &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru a=\r\ns guru \n          &gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma =\r\nincurred in the \n          &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimu=\r\nm threshhold of purity \n          &gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual pra=\r\nctices. Sacred thread or no \n          &gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or n=\r\no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n          &gt; &gt; after a while, when the p=\r\nerson crosses a threshhold of purity. The \n          &gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam=\r\n and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up \n          &gt; &gt; and make=\r\n the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n          &gt; &gt; =\r\nready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n        =\r\n  &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for \n=\r\n          &gt; &gt; me.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to sta=\r\nrt the Homam? or any day would be \n          &gt; &gt; fine?\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam remin=\r\nded me of my India \n          &gt; &gt; trip.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n          &gt; &gt; travele=\r\nd together to several places (on a specific project). We ended \n          &gt;=\r\n &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. A=\r\ns \n          &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take i=\r\nt \n          &gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded =\r\nto the \n          &gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a =\r\nhomam. Manish \n          &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavi=\r\nly in this city after \n          &gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n  =\r\n        &gt; &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our h=\r\nomas \n          &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly sta=\r\nrted raining \n          &gt; &gt; with really big drops.

How=\r\never, Manish did not reveal that \n          incident to me until much later=\r\n. All he told me at that time was that \n          Narayan really needed to =\r\ndo homam everyday and that I should teach a \n          simple procedure to =\r\nhim.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I experimented with homam, started \n          doing occasionall=\r\ny and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure \n          everyday. Afte=\r\nr doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to \n          the ori=\r\nginal task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed \n          manua=\r\nl for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as \n          =\r\nmany people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the \n        =\r\n  manual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). \n =\r\n         However, as far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan=\r\n! \n          When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people=\r\n across \n          the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was probably for a reason that Manish did not=\r\n tell me at \n          the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My=\r\n attitude and \n          mental state would&#39;ve been different while working=\r\n on the manual. I \n          would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurried m=\r\nore. Because the only \n          thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I t=\r\nook my sweet time, arrived \n          at the correct balance and also wrote=\r\n it down without many \n          pretensions. The whole effort ended up bei=\r\nng more saattwik and I \n          really benefited from the exercise. If I =\r\nhad known the full story, it \n          would have had more rajas given my =\r\nmental state then and I would not \n          have had made the same progres=\r\ns I made, while preparing myself to \n          teach homam to Narayan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Manish told me the full story only when \n          I was better prepared=\r\n to handle the information and, of course, I \n          added it to the pre=\r\nface of the manual as asked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A g=\r\nood guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information \n          that can=\r\n wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another \n          incident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O=\r\nne day in the spring of the same year, I decided to \n          spend a whol=\r\ne day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming \n          weekend. =\r\nThe inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched \n          on=\r\n to it. When I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. \n     =\r\n     I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 \n   =\r\n       breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch a=\r\nnd \n          another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basicall=\r\ny sitting \n          in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. =\r\nIt was a very \n          good experience. I was in a very nice state at the=\r\n end of the \n          day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I noticed on the next day that the previ=\r\nous day was \n          Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is co=\r\nnsidered a very \n          auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual=\r\n sadhana on that day \n          is 1000 times more powerful than on other d=\r\nays. Though I had not \n          noticed it before, I picked a perfect day =\r\nfor the sadhana. I was \n          excited. When I mentioned this to Manish =\r\nwith excitement a few days \n          later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earl=\r\nier itself. But I did not tell \n          you because knowing it would&#39;ve d=\r\nistracted you. You would have been \n          excited at doing the sadhana =\r\non Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement \n          would&#39;ve changed the men=\r\ntal focus and brought more rajas into the \n          sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He wa=\r\ns absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of \n          doing such a sadha=\r\nna. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the \n          mental focus=\r\n on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this \n          sadhana on =\r\na powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and \n          excitement, =\r\nbrought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra \n          furthe=\r\nr. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes \n          excellen=\r\nt progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After \n          hear=\r\ning Manish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still \n       =\r\n   alive and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more \n       =\r\n   delicious food!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lucky are those who have a guru who can \n        =\r\n  succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky \n =\r\n         are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the hear=\r\nt of \n          their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it ou=\r\nt through \n          further introspection and weaken it through conscious =\r\neffort.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* \n          * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I remember one more similar incident=\r\n. Before the shata \n          chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respe=\r\nct a lot took me to a \n          Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When h=\r\ne looked at me, he mentioned \n          the name of one of the saptarshis a=\r\nnd said that I very close to him \n          and that I would do some import=\r\nant work in this birth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I \n          saw Manish later that day,=\r\n I mentioned this to him. He immediately \n          became serious and said=\r\n &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more identity? \n          Your ego is already =\r\nstrong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the \n          Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;=\r\nNarasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the \n          engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimh=\r\na, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take great \n          effort to overc=\r\nome those identities and find True Self. As if that \n          challenge is=\r\n not sufficient, do you really need yet another new \n          identity to =\r\nfeed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be \n          correc=\r\nt. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise \n          abov=\r\ne all identities.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How true and wise!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog \n          a=\r\nnd get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense \n      =\r\n    of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the \n=\r\n          energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and =\r\nfeed \n          the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to rest=\r\nrain ego \n          and increase detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish has a unique way=\r\n of looking at \n          things and some simple points he made brought so =\r\nmuch clarity to my \n          thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution i=\r\nn this life. Even without \n          giving any specific mantra to me, like=\r\n many spiritual gurus do, he lit \n          the lamp of knowledge in my hea=\r\nrt. He would say the lamp and light \n          were already there and he si=\r\nmply wiped the dust on the lamp that was \n          blocking the light. Tha=\r\nt is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off \n          the thick layer of =\r\ndirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) \n          that encloses th=\r\ne lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we \n          may be too=\r\n caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;H=\r\nomam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But \n          one=\r\n should also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an \n          =\r\nongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does not \n    =\r\n      take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long=\r\n \n          time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the pat=\r\nh and \n          not worry about the progress and the distance left. One wh=\r\no keeps \n          walking without distractions will reach the goal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;The point I \n          want to emphasize is that the external rituals (lik=\r\ne homam) and the \n          internal introspection (to change attitude) sho=\r\nuld go hand in hand. \n          After a while, there will be synergy betwee=\r\nn them and they will start \n          to work together very effectively.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n          regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- \n          --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nDo Pitri \n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n          href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n          =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n =\r\n         Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comc=\r\nast. \n          net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n          h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath \n          Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; \n          targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan \n          nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- -&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:narayan.iyer%40=\r\ngmail.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.co=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste \n          Friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some=\r\n ramblings ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Regarding fire getting extinguis=\r\nhed (or anything similar to it), \n          it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens with all beg=\r\ninners and its only practice which \n          makes one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; perfect.

In Kaliyuga, along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa, surrendering to ones \n=\r\n          chosen deity is the best path for most. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me =\r\nshare \n          one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I also&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n          consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for =\r\nShata \n          Chandi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I though=\r\nt he was \n          really joking!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I got back to the US, he ca=\r\nlled me again \n          and reminded me. It then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; occured to me he =\r\nwas really being \n          serious. So, I started searching on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the=\r\n net and I found a \n          really flimsy document, but nevertheless I to=\r\nok&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it up and \n          performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Man=\r\nishji then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reminded \n          me of the book he gifted me, but eve=\r\nn in that it was entirely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          in Samskrit and illiterate tha=\r\nt I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish \n          between&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an instruction an=\r\nd sloka :). Around this time, \n          Narasimha occasionally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; per=\r\nformed a longer version of the homam \n          and I particpated in it, bu=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; never could grasp it. I then \n          asked Narasimha to guide =\r\nme, which he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; did, but still it did \n          not get through my re=\r\nally dense brains :). I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; felt really \n          helpless, but the st=\r\nars were such that I never gave up,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          instead I made a sin=\r\ncere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he \n          really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intends t=\r\nhat I perform the homa, then he should kindly \n          show me the&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me \n          that he has d=\r\necided&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of \n          the hom=\r\na. I just couldnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe my luck and thanked the \n          Elepha=\r\nnt-headed omnipotent for his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; grace. Well ... its been \n          ex=\r\nactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; baby-steps and making \n     =\r\n     progress everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and \n =\r\n         the all the divine forces for helping&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no ma=\r\ntter \n          what. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then=\r\n nobody got \n          perfect the very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; first time, unless he has w=\r\norked on it a lot \n          in his previous lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Its all a conti=\r\nnuum. Dont worry about \n          time, we have future lives ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pl=\r\nenty of time. These things \n          take their own sweet time, doesnt hap=\r\npen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; overnight. No matter \n          what, complete your homa everyd=\r\nay, that should be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the primary \n          goal ... nothing else. Pl=\r\ns dont waver from it, whether you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get \n          or dont get anythi=\r\nng. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          move on to =\r\nhigher things.

Let me give an \n          analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Think of your favorite \n          deity as the master and yoursel=\r\nf as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; servant. A servant \n          simply serves the master=\r\n. Similarly, all the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana you \n          do and your other=\r\n activities are your way to serve your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          master.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be \n          very we=\r\nalthy and have many big checks &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everyday to cash \n          an=\r\nd also many big checks everyday to mail others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yet, \n       =\r\n   he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank and \n      =\r\n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing \n     =\r\n     anything in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings \n =\r\n         who execute god&#39;s agenda in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world. That is why =\r\n\n          various gods (including Vishnu himself) and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; variou=\r\ns \n          rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; \n          supreme god of this world operates through various phys=\r\nical persons \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; present on earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n          We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purif=\r\ny ourselves and try \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to help others, because that i=\r\ns god&#39;s work. Just as a \n          servant carries &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; master&#39;s p=\r\napers to the bank, we do such \n          work for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is \n          applauded by others as good work =\r\ntends to promote ego &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          and we need to guard against =\r\nit. A servant carrying a million dollar \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; check to t=\r\nhe bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a \n          servant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing \n          it. Both are mer=\r\nely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not \n          own anyth=\r\ning. Both are just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the \n          maste=\r\nr to carry out his agenda. Similarly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one who does \n         =\r\n what are considered great deeds in this world and one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n     =\r\n     who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n    =\r\n      &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in thi=\r\ns \n          world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may con=\r\nsider \n          oneself superior to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the other because his/he=\r\nr deeds are \n          considered superior by the world, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but =\r\nhe/she is just as \n          foolish as a servant who considers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; himself/herself \n          superior to another servant carrying somethin=\r\ng less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          valuable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; If this attitude of \n          being a servant of god fully penetrates =\r\none&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attitude, \n          thinking and instincts, one is saf=\r\ne no matter what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          situations his previous karmas pl=\r\nace one in. One can remain happy and \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; blissful in p=\r\nleasure and pain, in praise and criticism \n          and in light &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; and darkness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Have the=\r\n same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It \n          is a job &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. \n          But yo=\r\nu own nothing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n          Nara=\r\nsimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- \n       =\r\n   --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n =\r\n         href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n   =\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
