The materialistic r=\r\nelationship solves worldly problems,\nwhile spiritual relationship leads tow=\r\nards self-realization. This is one way of\nleading life.\n\nTo my understandin=\r\ng,\nNarasimha spreads the message to live with only one relationship which i=\r\ns\nspirituality or love/surrender to God. Yes, Narasimha certainly believes =\r\nhomam\nas the vehicle for this relationship and teaches the same since he ha=\r\ns first hand\ngreat experiences through homam. In spirituality, there is no =\r\nproblem of\ncounting gives and takes from Yajamana. A saadhaka accepts whate=\r\nver he gets due\nto his karmic baggage and leads his life. If he still has d=\r\nesires, he uses the\nsame relationship not with a staunch give or take attit=\r\nude, but with a\nsurrender attitude. Surrender is a tough path. Belief is th=\r\nat homam creates\nexactly such an attitude over time and all\n\nthe material n=\r\needs are\ntaken care without paying much attention to them. Once in spiritua=\r\nlity path,\none may learn shastras based on his conditioning, but I don=E2=\r\n=80=99t see it being\ndiscouraged here. In fact, learning homam ritual is in=\r\ncreasing awareness of shastras.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI very sorry to say that\nyou under=\r\nstanding is totally incorrect. Please read the very first sentence of\nNarsi=\r\nmha like \n\nAstrologers routinely recommend remedial measures\ninvolving mant=\r\nras and poojas and people spend a lot of money on them. Do they\nwork? I wil=\r\nl give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I\nwill be h=\r\nonest, straight-forward and blunt. The topic has nothing to do with\nspiritu=\r\nality as per my understanding. Narsimha only show his own way of solving\nve=\r\nxed problem of so called unqualified priests with subtopic of spiritual pow=\r\ner\nof priests. From\nmy side this is due to mixing of religion and spiritual=\r\nity. Religion as a whole\nis for all four purusharthas i.e. dharma, artha, k=\r\nama\nand moksha while spirituality is for moksha only. In other words you ma=\r\ny think\nthis as pathway to desire fulfillment and pathway to god. Desire fu=\r\nlfillment\nhas nothing to do with moksha and for moksha vasanakshaya, desire=\r\n eliination is\nneeded. In this perspective you can understand me better.\n\nV=\r\nery few sadhaka would\nlike to visit to astrologers as they might be having =\r\nguidance by superiors,\ntraditions etc. Masses visiting astrologers mainly i=\r\nnclude illiterate folk\nw.r.t. to these topics who only want solutions for t=\r\nhere problems. So they have\nnothing alike as sadhakas and are totally ignor=\r\nant w.r.t. all these things. I\nthink Narsimha=E2=80=99s explanation was for=\r\n this group only which from my side is not\ncorrect. And this group is conce=\r\nrned about all three purusharthas other than\nmoksha.\n\nSurrender is a tough\n=\r\npath. Belief is that homam creates exactly such an attitude over time and a=\r\nll\nthe material needs are taken care without paying much attention to them.=\r\n Once\nin spirituality path, one may learn shastras. If this is your attitud=\r\ne you\nare great but common people including me don=E2=80=99t have such atti=\r\ntude as we are\nstill at lower ladder of evolution and that=E2=80=99s why we=\r\n need remedies. =C2=A0\n\nComing to priest as a\nmediator or technician, I bel=\r\nieve, his message is to find a capable technician\nor priest for the job. Do=\r\nn=E2=80=99t we want a plumber who fixes the plumbing problem\nrather than to=\r\n see that the problem comes back after he leaves with money? We\nwant to hir=\r\ne capable plumber and also need to do some maintenance ourselves. If\none th=\r\ninks it is an important desire to be fulfilled, the message is to attain\nit=\r\n through spirituality or the next best is to hire a spiritually inclined\npr=\r\niest while still maintaining love relationship with God. In fact, I have se=\r\nen\nNarasimha encourages such capable priests. So, he has nothing against pr=\r\niests\nwho perform their job.\n\nI request you to read\nother posts from where =\r\nI copy some contents. If we say priest must have shakti\nhow can we count hi=\r\ns nature of shakti in terms of quality, quantity, depth and\nneed? Should we=\r\n consider shakti to beget baby, remove diseases, give immense\nwealth is sam=\r\ne?, how to differentiate priest with and without shakthi, most imp\nwho will=\r\n differentiate this, what are the parameters to define this, what are\nthe t=\r\nools to understand all these subtle points, etc will be the complex issues\n=\r\nbefore us or yajamana when we/ he thinks of doing any remedy. Do we have an=\r\ny\nuniversal system for this? If you think over these issues you will come t=\r\no know\nthe truth. If a priest perform a puja every third day he must have a=\r\nt least\ntons of shakti to give results. Only person who is in unmani/trans =\r\navashta can\nhave such a huge shakti and I think such person will not use hi=\r\ns power to wash\nsins of so many people unless asked by his superiors to do =\r\nthis. \n\nThis mail on remedies and\npriests is inline with spreading spiritua=\r\nlity. This will help some people who\nare confused with many solutions and p=\r\noint them towards spirituality. To me,\nthe message delivered is consistent =\r\nwith earlier messages.\n\nYes, I fully understand\nand whole heartedly appreci=\r\nate Narsimha=E2=80=99s guidelines for doing sadhana on own\nbut that does no=\r\nt mean to propagate wrong ideas or to interpret scriptures in\nthis way. And=\r\n why I am saying this is clear from my comments regarding generic\nmantra an=\r\nd focus of mind. \n\nDear Kishore, either =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=\r\n=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=\r\n=A4=E0=A5=87\n=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A0=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=\r\n=83 or =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=\r\n=A5=87 =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=87\n=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=A4=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=83=E0=A5=A4 To be\nfrank al=\r\nl this brain exercise is having very little spiritual value and doing\nsadha=\r\nna for self realization is the key and that is the sole aim of all shruti,\n=\r\nsmriti.

Belief is that homam creates exact=\r\nly such an attitude over time and all\nthe material needs are taken care wit=\r\nhout paying much attention to them. Once\nin spirituality path, one may lear=\r\nn shastras. &lt;b&gt;If this is your attitude you\nare great but common people inc=\r\nluding me don=E2=80=99t have such attitude as we are\nstill at lower ladder =\r\nof evolution and that=E2=80=99s why we need remedies. &lt;span style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;&gt;Comi=\r\nng to priest as a\nmediator or technician, I believe, his message is to find=\r\n a capable technician\nor priest for the job. Don=E2=80=99t we want a plumbe=\r\nr who fixes the plumbing problem\nrather than to see that the problem comes =\r\nback after he leaves with money? We\nwant to hire capable plumber and also n=\r\need to do some maintenance ourselves. If\none thinks it is an important desi=\r\nre to be fulfilled, the message is to attain\nit through spirituality or the=\r\n next best is to hire a spiritually inclined\npriest while still maintaining=\r\n love relationship with God. In fact, I have seen\nNarasimha encourages such=\r\n capable priests. So, he has nothing against priests\nwho perform their job.=\r\n&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;&gt;I request you =\r\nto read\nother posts from where I copy some contents. If we say priest must =\r\nhave shakti\nhow can we count his nature of shakti in terms of quality, quan=\r\ntity, depth and\nneed? Should we consider shakti to beget baby, remove disea=\r\nses, give immense\nwealth is same?, how to differentiate priest with and wit=\r\nhout shakthi, most imp\nwho will differentiate this, what are the parameters=\r\n to define this, what are\nthe tools to understand all these subtle points, =\r\netc will be the complex issues\nbefore us or yajamana when we/ he thinks of =\r\ndoing any remedy. Do we have any\nuniversal system for this? If you think ov=\r\ner these issues you will come to know\nthe truth. If a priest perform a puja=\r\n every third day he must have at least\ntons of shakti to give results. Only=\r\n person who is in unmani/trans avashta can\nhave such a huge shakti and I th=\r\nink such person will not use his power to wash\nsins of so many people unles=\r\ns asked by his superiors to do this. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\r\n=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quo=\r\nt;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;&gt;This mail on remedies and\npriests is inline with =\r\nspreading spirituality. This will help some people who\nare confused with ma=\r\nny solutions and point them towards spirituality.
