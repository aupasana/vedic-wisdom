Or are th=\r\ney of\n&gt; later growth? (2) Is the Creator impartial? Then why is one born la=\r\nme,\n&gt; another blind, and so on? (3) Are the eight Dikpalas, thirty-three cr=\r\nores of\n&gt; gods and the seven rishis existent even today?\n&gt; \n&gt; M.: Refer the=\r\nse questions to yourself and the answer will be found.\n&gt; \n&gt; After a pause, =\r\nSri Bhagavan continued: if we first know our Self then all\n&gt; other matters =\r\nwill be plain to us. Let us know our Self and then enquire\n&gt; concerning the=\r\n Creator and creation. Without first knowing the Self, to seek\n&gt; knowledge =\r\nof God, etc., is ignorance.\n&gt; \n&gt; A man suffering from jaundice sees everyth=\r\ning yellow. If he tells others\n&gt; that all things are yellow who will accept=\r\n his statement?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The creation is said to have an origin. How? Like a=\r\n tree and the seed from\n&gt; which it has grown. How was the seed produced? Fr=\r\nom a similar tree. Where is\n&gt; the end to the series of questions? Therefore=\r\n one must know one&#39;s Self\n&gt; before the world is known.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: TALKS W=\r\nITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Love And Love Alone\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Namo Bh=\r\nagavate Sri Ramanaya\n&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
