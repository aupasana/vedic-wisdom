He/She/It- the divine as well as the sadhaka is=\r\n beyond the intellect, beyond consciousness itself.\n\nThe concept of Shiva S=\r\nhakti aikyam(oneness) reflects the fact that &#39;When Shiva acts, He is Shakti=\r\n(Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati by Shree Guru Gorakshanatha)&#39;. Anthropomorphism =\r\ndoes not help in understanding here.\n\nThere is no cure or answer for all th=\r\nese questions but direct experience. Direct experience comes with sadhana a=\r\nnd grace.Dont wait for all intellectual questions to be answered. If you do=\r\n/are doing sadhana under the guidance of a Guru, everything will be answere=\r\nd. \n\nWhen one does sakamya(with desire) upasana/sadhana, then it is require=\r\nd to be very careful with any tantrika practice as one is dealing with a gr=\r\neat deal of power and one is trying to control that power( of the entire un=\r\niverse) with ones endeavours and our all too human intellect. If one is doi=\r\nng nishkamya upasana offering everything to the Deity, then there is nothin=\r\ng to be afraid of in all the worlds- because we are controlled and guided b=\r\ny Jaganmatha and that is all there is to it.So to answer your question dire=\r\nctly-it does not depend who you worship. What matters is your attitude. Dev=\r\ni is capable of giving anything just like a Deva is- they are indistinct- t=\r\nhe like water and its wetness.\n\nIf you want mundane benefit or just relief =\r\nfrom your past sins by some &#39;gnanam&#39; then that is what is given.Look at Rav=\r\nana for example- who was a Rishi putra and a great tapasvi and Shiva sadhak=\r\na as an extreme example of this.\nIf you want the Devi or Devatha Himself or=\r\n Herself or Para gnanam( the ultimate gnana) then that is what you will get=\r\n.\n\nRegardless, in time one of my Gurus has said that even a sakamya upasaka=\r\n is led to nishkamya- though it may take lifetimes. Doing sadhana even for =\r\nkamya is better than not doing sadhana at all.\n\nRegards\n\nS\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji and others,\n&gt;\n&gt; Struggling how to put this properly but =\r\nI have been wondering a lot about the above concept, especially in relation=\r\n to the results of mantras for the same. The same theme repeats itself over=\r\n and over again in many ways:\n&gt; \n&gt; o Shiva/Shakti\n&gt; o Prakriti/Purusha\n&gt; o =\r\nIn astrology mantras for planets versus mantras for signs (signs always rel=\r\nated to mahavidya/devi)\n&gt; o General literature about male/female gods and t=\r\nheir progeny\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, it seems to me that the idea is one of progressi=\r\nve manifestation (of consciousness/form/individuality). The male is the man=\r\nifester, the female is the field/area in which the manifestation will occur=\r\n and the progeny (in the cases there is progeny) is the result. The result =\r\nis always at a progressively more outward level. \n&gt; \n&gt; I assume this is the=\r\n idea behind all the male/female symbolism. Please correct me if this is wr=\r\nong. However, I still struggle with what is the result of devi/mahavidya ma=\r\nntra versus the other (I assume &quot;male&quot;) mantras. Extending the same concept=\r\n as above, it would seem that the non-devi/non-mahavidya type mantras are t=\r\nhe ones that result in aligning one&#39;s actions with whatever it is that the =\r\nmantra&#39;s goal is. While devi/mahavidya type mantras, in going with same sym=\r\nbolism, would not actually directly influence one&#39;s actions but would give =\r\nknowledge of the area of action, and thereby help in making the correct cho=\r\nice when indeed the time comes for action. This is purely my own conclusion=\r\n. Is this correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; And even so, I still don&#39;t understand why there see=\r\nms to be a requirement for precision and exactness in devi/mahavidya type s=\r\nadhana but not in the non-devi type sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please forgive me if I am=\r\n simplifying things too much. Any and all comments are more than welcome, I=\r\n am simply trying to improve my understanding (for now).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
