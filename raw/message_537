However, this incident did not happ=\r\nen the first time Jogin met Ramakrishna. The first time Jogin met Ramakrish=\r\nna, he left quickly but decided to meet again. After meeting Ramakrishna se=\r\nveral times, Jogin decided to spend a night with him and serve if needed. S=\r\no he stayed over one night. That is when the incident happened.\n \nJogin was=\r\n a light sleeper and woke up in the middle of the night. He found Ramakrish=\r\nna missing in his bed. He went and checked at the water pot and looked outs=\r\nide to see if Ramakrishna was walking outside. When he did not find, then h=\r\ne suspected &quot;may be he teaches us about brahmacharya (celibacy), but goes t=\r\no his wife secretly in the night&quot;. He positioned himself outside the nahaba=\r\nt (where Sarada Mata lived) and watched the door carefully. Later he heard =\r\nthe chattering of slippers from Panchavati on the other side and found Rama=\r\nkrishna approaching him. Ramakrishna first asked &quot;what are you doing here&quot;.=\r\n When Jogin was silent and had an expression of shame on his face, Ramakris=\r\nhna calmly said &quot;well, you are right to test me. You should test a saint by=\r\n the day and night before believing in him.&quot; Of course, Jogin was ashamed a=\r\nnd did not sleep the whole night.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI too suspected m=\r\ny guru a few times like Jogin and questioned him. He too never took offense=\r\n. I will describe one such incident.\n \nOnce he told me that he &quot;saw&quot; me ear=\r\nlier in the day when he was driving on a highway in UK. He apparently &quot;saw&quot;=\r\n me doing homam at my house in US. He said he lifted his hand while driving=\r\n, as if blessing me. His wife sitting next to him asked what he was doing i=\r\nn the middle of driving at a high speed on a highway. When he told her &quot;Nar=\r\nasimha is doing a homam right now and I am blessing him&quot;, she thought he wa=\r\ns being crazy.\n \nWhen he described this incident, I immediately knew of a w=\r\nay to find out if he was being truthful. When I do homam, I normally wear a=\r\n veshti of white or red or yellow color. On that day, I was wearing somethi=\r\nng I very rarely wear and it would be nearly impossible to get it right wit=\r\nh a random guess. I asked him &quot;can I test you and verify if you really saw =\r\nme&quot;. He said &quot;ok, let us see&quot;. Then I asked him &quot;what was I wearing when do=\r\ning homam this morning&quot;. He said, &quot;It seemed like you were wearing some str=\r\nange kind of blue color veshi and a shirt of a different shade of blue colo=\r\nr.&quot;\n \nHe was absolutely correct. I used my blue veshti only twice so far an=\r\nd that day was one of the two days. What I was wearing on that day for homa=\r\nm was something I rarely wear and difficult to just guess. So it is very ve=\r\nry likely that he indeed saw me doing homam on that day.\n \n*        *      =\r\n  *\n \nOf course, siddhis like divya drishti (seeing things far away mentall=\r\ny) are irrelevant. I am not interested in them at all. My guru teaches &quot;wha=\r\ntever abilities we need for our work will be given by the Mother. We should=\r\n not desire anything and at the same time not reject anything given by Her.=\r\n Our only desire should be to remain at Her feet always and to remember to =\r\ndesire that always. Rest of the things will come and go as She wants us to =\r\ndo various things. Leave it to Her and go with the flow without resisting a=\r\nnd feeling emotions like pride or shame, happiness or sadness etc.&quot;\n \nI bel=\r\nieve that my impulse to test my guru at that instant came only because my g=\r\nuru (and the Mother) wanted me to do so, because there is some reason for t=\r\nhat. Though it seems like I suspected my guru, I have a lot of faith in him=\r\n and in the Mother and think that I am used as an instrument by them to do =\r\nthe work they want done, including testing guru with temporary suspicion. I=\r\n am an unsuspecting playmate in their Play. I will not be surprised if Jogi=\r\nn also felt the same way later, after testing Ramakrishna. But his action t=\r\naught something to others (even today!). That is perhaps why Ramakrishna an=\r\nd Kali used Jogin as an instrument in their Play.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI=\r\nn the example of money under Ramakrishna&#39;s pillow, how did he know it? Did =\r\nhe have all kinds of super-natural abilities? May be. But there is another =\r\nway to look at it. He was a pure soul and the Mother devised a divine play =\r\nto demonstrate his purity. It was the Mother&#39;s divine play that Naren shoul=\r\nd get an impulse to test Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna should get an impulse to =\r\nrun away from the bed and pass the test and it should inspire some people i=\r\nn future.\n \nIt is foolish to go after anything other than getting a perfect=\r\n sense of surrender and devotion to the chosen deity. If that comes, everyt=\r\nhing needed for what one is supposed to do in the world is provided by the =\r\nchosen deity. No pride and no shame, no happiness and no sadness, no excite=\r\nment and no depression, no attraction and no repulsion - one becomes a chil=\r\nd and a playmate in the Divine play of the chosen deity. ALL that is needed=\r\n is a perfect sense of surrender. Ramakrishna had it. Nature composed sever=\r\nal beautiful plays involving him and attracted the other actors of that pla=\r\ny towards him.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: raja=\r\nrshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, September =\r\n30, 2008 1:22 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n\n=\r\n\n        Dear Narasimhaji\n\n        Another wonderful mail. Everyday when I =\r\nopen my mailbox in the morning, I keep searching for your mails. Each one i=\r\ns an inspiration.\n\n        One more point I would like to add, I had read s=\r\nome books on Thakur in Bengali and in one there was the description of an i=\r\nndicident. Once Swamiji wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say tha=\r\nt he could not handle money (as it represented something grossly material),=\r\n Swamji deliberately put a note under Thakur&#39;s pillow when Thakur was not i=\r\nn the room. Later when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly got up=\r\n as if in pain and said something is very wrong in here, Hriday, who was us=\r\ned to be there, searched the bed and found that money under his pillow. But=\r\n Thakur never got offended with these things.\n\n        Infact in one instan=\r\nce, when one of his disciples had come to him for the first time, Thakur as=\r\nked him to stay over at Dakshineshwar. At night the disciple woke up and sa=\r\nw that Thakur was leaving the room. A doubt entered the disciples mind, he =\r\nthought maybe Thakur is goinfg towards the Nahabat house where Sri Sarada M=\r\na used to stay. So he quitely decided to follow Thakur and see where he is =\r\ngoing, after all it maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat secretly et=\r\nc etc.. he was genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the room following Tha=\r\nkur at a distance, he saw Thakur going to the Panchvati and sitting down fo=\r\nr meditation and there he sat for two hours.Later when Thakur came back, he=\r\n told that person, who later became his disciple, that he had done very goo=\r\nd to test Thakur. Further Thakur said, no one should accept a Guru without =\r\ntesting. And to see and judge a person&#39;s sprittuality he has to be observed=\r\n when he is public and when he is alone. There should be no diference in hi=\r\ns words and actions. Etc etc.\n\n        Every incident in Thakur&#39;s life is l=\r\nike an illustration of a deeper point for ordianry people like us.\n\n       =\r\n -Regards\n         Rajarshi\n\n\n        &quot;This above all: to thine own self be=\r\n true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n\n        --- On Tue, 30/9/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

While a really spiritual person must continuo=\r\nusly try to destroy ego, so many spiritual gurus are there around us with b=\r\nloated egos which are easily offended at a hint of criticism or overly exci=\r\nted at sycophancy. Such gurus are not of much use.\n\n          But how do se=\r\nparate the grains from the chaff? It is not easy, especially when there are=\r\n just a few grains in the middle of a big pile of chaff. Astrology is usefu=\r\nl but not that much. Astrologer&#39;s mind, which makes the final judgments, wo=\r\nrks based on his/her prejudices and secret beliefs.\n\n          *        *  =\r\n      *\n\n          In the past, many great souls used intellectual discrimi=\r\nnation and intuition to judge one&#39;s guru for a long time before whole-heart=\r\nedly embracing one&#39;s guru. In many traditions within Hinduism, this is enco=\r\nuraged. You do not accept a guru in an impulse. You &quot;test&quot; your guru and ta=\r\nke your time to accept him. But, once you accept a person as your guru, you=\r\n follow him faithfully.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          If you ta=\r\nke Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) , the celebrated disciple of Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa, he was a highly rational and skeptical young man. Though Ramakri=\r\nshna had induced a samadhi in Narendra by mere touch in their second meetin=\r\ng itself, it was not enough to convince Narendra of Ramakrishna&#39; s ability =\r\nand purity. He thought the whole experience could just have been a hallucin=\r\nation/ hypnotism and did not jump to any conclusion. As he visited Ramakris=\r\nhna continuously, received love and knowledge from him and saw that Ramakri=\r\nshna indeed walked the walk (as opposed to just talking the talk), he was s=\r\nlowly convinced of the purity of Ramakrishna. He then became a tireless sol=\r\ndier who dedicated his life to carrying out the mission of his guru!\n\n     =\r\n     During the early stages, he even told Ramakrishna bluntly about the la=\r\ntter&#39;s visions of Kali, Krishna, Rama etc, &quot;Sir, they could all just be you=\r\nr imaginations or hallucinations&quot; . Narendra did not even believe in god wi=\r\nth a form and believed only in the formless. Ramakrishna was never offended=\r\n at these comments.\n\n          Other sishyas like Joginder (Swami Yogananda=\r\n) also approached Ramakrishna skeptically and tested him for a duration. Th=\r\nese young men who surrounded Ramakrishna weren&#39;t blind men led by a blind m=\r\nan. They were all rishis or associates of rishis, who were reborn together =\r\nfor a purpose.\n\n          They observed Ramakrishna for a while, confirmed =\r\nthat he practiced what he preached and realized that there was a valuable l=\r\nesson in each action and word of his. They took a while to realize his puri=\r\nty and divinity, but once they realized they became faithful sishyas. He ac=\r\ncepted them, loved them and taught them even before they realized his true =\r\nnature and accepted him fully as their guru. He knew they were skeptical an=\r\nd testing him, but he was never offended (what good is a guru who cannot re=\r\ncognize a worthy student and what good is a guru whose ego is insulted at s=\r\nomeone&#39;s skepticism). Once they accepted him and became faithful sishyas, e=\r\nach one of them was also transformed into a really pure person who takes th=\r\ne entire life as a sadhana and maintains purity in every thought and action=\r\n. Each sishya of a Ramakrishna was a role model in spiritual purity.\n\n     =\r\n     *        *        *\n            \n          One whose rinas draw one to=\r\nwards a fake guru gets such a guru because that is what his karmas entitle =\r\nhim to. The circumstances we have to face are based on the previous actions=\r\n. But the current action (freewill) is in our hands. If one can truly belie=\r\nve from the deepest cores of heart that one&#39;s guru is pure and like Shiva h=\r\nimself, follows guru blindly and entertains no doubt whatsoever, that WILL =\r\npay off oneday. Nature WILL bring light into that person&#39;s spiritual life. =\r\nIt is just a matter of time.\n\n          Thus, I will not be judgmental abou=\r\nt other gurus and their sishyas. If a sishya believes in his/her guru fully=\r\n, so be it. It is not our business.\n\n          But, if one were to find a g=\r\nuru like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Sri=\r\nla Prabhupada, it is one&#39;s immense luck. However, the point I want to make =\r\nis that having a great guru is not a guarantee of success and also having a=\r\n fake guru is not a guarantee of failure!\n\n          At the end of the day,=\r\n the measure of success in any sadhana is the purity generated by that sadh=\r\nana. The measure of the purity is the effacement of ego. If ego is reduced =\r\ncompletely or eliminated, one is making progress. This can happen inspite o=\r\nf who is the guru, what one is doing etc.\n\n          When the full grace of=\r\n the Supreme Being falls on a person, any medium is sufficient to reflect t=\r\nhat grace.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n          ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n          D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n      =\r\n    Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          F=\r\nree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n          -=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n =\r\n           ----- Original Message ----- \n            From: Lakshmi Kary \n  =\r\n          To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n            Sent: Monday, Sep=\r\ntember 29, 2008 2:06 AM\n            Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (=\r\nRe: Dharma)\n\n\n            Hare Rama Krishna\n            Dear Narasimha.\n   =\r\n         Sorry I got my people and lineages all confused! Was reading about=\r\n too many people lately.\n\n            Also last night  I saw a  documentary=\r\n on religious leaders, cults etc.\n            People want to see God so bad=\r\nly they are very eager to push anyone who is willing to claim to be special=\r\n up on a pedestal.That happened with my ex , he got up there,felt it wasn&#39;t=\r\n right and tried to climb down, but his&quot;disciples&quot; didn&#39;t want him to.\n    =\r\n        They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his purity, and all s=\r\norts of cover ups.\n            God and Jesus are living in some many places=\r\n. Sometimes there are several people simultaneously claiming to be Jesus in=\r\n any psych unit across the world/\n            Its amazing where and to with=\r\nin whom people see &quot;God&quot;.\n            Isnt a spiritual master, guru, living=\r\n like a mortal in all capacities while telling others how to find realizati=\r\non sort of hypocritical and bizarre?\n\n            There is one fellow who u=\r\nsed to be a heroin addict and now he says he is Jesus and has a huge follow=\r\ning. they are willing to do whatever he says and they give him money and al=\r\nl sorts of things.\n            Yesterday I went on the Internet, and looked=\r\n at some many so called yogis, preachers etc\n            IN the USA I cant =\r\nbegin to tell you the number of religious leaders that were revered as &quot;God=\r\n&quot; or some other incarnation.\n            India is no different, perhaps wor=\r\nse because people have a natural respect for sadhus , yogis etc and more yo=\r\ngis can get away with pretending to be a renunciate.\n            I believe =\r\nGod appears in different forms in different places and times to attract peo=\r\nple who are looking for him and to associate with his devotees..\n          =\r\n  Now that Documentary TV program and your posts got my mind swimming.\n    =\r\n        What are principles of religion? What is dharma, What is the purpos=\r\ne?\n            Now if there were no laws or rules, social or religious and =\r\neveryone did what they felt like, we would be living in a hell.

But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in on=\r\ne way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti =\r\nyoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experi=\r\nenced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of =\r\nnirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no &quot;experience&quot; . He was in sahaja samad=\r\nhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch=\r\n or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why=\r\n he could do all that!!!).\n\n                  Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dhar=\r\nma on their sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dh=\r\narma of each sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, wor=\r\nship the form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had dee=\r\np insight into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instruction=\r\ns. He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms and totally=\r\n different paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things =\r\nto different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive att=\r\nitude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you.=\r\n With your attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him=\r\n. You should learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your=\r\n guru in a good stead and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who nee=\r\nded to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people=\r\n and came away silently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you. Shastras say that yo=\r\nu should kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong beha=\r\nvior? You should give them a piece of your mind.&quot;\n\n                  Spirit=\r\nual sadhana does not mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure e=\r\nveryday for a certain period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous pro=\r\ncess by which one transforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. =\r\nThat way, every action and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an op=\r\nportunity for introspection and transformation of internal attitude.\n\n     =\r\n             Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal =\r\nsadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of sadhakas a=\r\nnd he was an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of sishyas.\n\n        =\r\n          Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobody and would b=\r\ne lower than dirt. I would not be able to say anything intelligent or meani=\r\nngful in spiritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspired by something I=\r\n write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and to Sri Ramakrishn=\r\na for showering their grace using me as an instrument and not to me.\n\n     =\r\n             BTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you like to peo=\r\nple who may be interested in spiritual discussions.

The time then was such that there was too much weight \n          =\r\n                  on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some w=\r\neight.

When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakris=\r\nhna \n                            said), his dharma based on the time and pl=\r\nace may be something else.\n\n                            * * *\n\n            =\r\n                The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s d=\r\nharma?\n\n                            Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s =\r\nwords saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n                            and not s=\r\nomeone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \n        =\r\n                    of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long =\r\ntime, the concept of \n                            caste mobility was very m=\r\nuch there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n                            k=\r\nilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a =\r\n\n                            kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a bra=\r\nhmana and and a maharshi \n                            later. Basically varn=\r\na shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \n                    =\r\n        of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As =\r\none \n                            develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna=\r\n based on what one does.\n\n                            Thus, the misinterpre=\r\ntation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n                   =\r\n         dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dh=\r\narmas in \n                            the world. Each person has individual=\r\n dharma.\n\n                            Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very =\r\nvery very difficult. If one is pure \n                            enough, on=\r\ne will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n        =\r\n                    mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrou=\r\nnded by a lot of \n                            noise from other parts of our=\r\n minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n                            c=\r\nonfused.\n\n                            We should make the best judgment comb=\r\nining discrimination and intuition and \n                            decide =\r\nwhat is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \n     =\r\n                       the best we can is all that we can do!\n\n            =\r\n                More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is=\r\n to engage in \n                            actions without identification. =\r\n*That* alone ensures that we are not \n                            accumulat=\r\ning new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \n        =\r\n                    too much attachment to what we are doing. We should eng=\r\nage in the best \n                            possible actions (based on our=\r\n best judgment on what our dharma in the given \n                           =\r\n situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the =\r\n\n                            action as possible. When the action is finishe=\r\nd, we should leave the result \n                            to god. We shoul=\r\nd not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n                 =\r\n           work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication thr=\r\nough \n                            untached action) will simplify our ego an=\r\nd purify our consciousness slowly. \n                            As we becom=\r\ne purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n         =\r\n                   There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enab=\r\nle us to see our \n                            dharma clearly and follow it =\r\nwithout incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \n                          =\r\n  but not as difficult as people think.\n\n                            The bo=\r\nttomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n   =\r\n                         &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one =\r\nengages in action with \n                            little attachment.\n\n   =\r\n                         * * *\n\n                            In deciding one=\r\n&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n                 =\r\n           Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned me=\r\nn. One can \n                            derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A sp=\r\necial place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n                            master=\r\n. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \n     =\r\n                       the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it s=\r\nincerely.\n\n                            When Arjuna was confused about what =\r\nhis dharma was and thought killing gurus \n                            and r=\r\nelatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n      =\r\n                      dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was con=\r\nfused about his dharma \n                            and wanted to renounce =\r\nthe world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n                      =\r\n      Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the m=\r\naterial \n                            world and do the work of Mother for hi=\r\nm.\n\n                            One who is not in tune with nature and does=\r\n not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n                            debts are and=\r\n what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n            =\r\n                one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a c=\r\nlear insight into \n                            one&#39;s inner core, such a gur=\r\nu can give perfect guidance.\n\n                            * * *\n\n          =\r\n                  Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of=\r\n principles and \n                            declare that as the dharma. No=\r\n, dharma changes from person to person, from \n                            t=\r\nime to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find =\r\n\n                            out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine =\r\none&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n                            dharma by increas=\r\ning internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \n                 =\r\n           sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without =\r\nmuch \n                            attachment, one can slowly purify oneself=\r\n and refine one&#39;s understanding of \n                            one&#39;s indiv=\r\nidual dharma.\n\n                            Best regards,\n                  =\r\n          Narasimha\n                            ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -\n                            Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n                  =\r\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarp=\r\nana\n                            Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- wisdom\n                            Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n                            Free Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n                      =\r\n      Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n    =\r\n                        ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- - \n\n                            ----- Original Message ----- \n =\r\n                           From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n=\r\n                            To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n          =\r\n                  Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n              =\r\n              Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n                            &gt;=\r\n Namaste to all\n                            &gt;\n                            &gt;=\r\n i just finished my Aghora series\n                            &gt; and in it i=\r\nn last part\n                            &gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is =\r\nvery personal.\n                            &gt; Can somebody share views on th=\r\nat and how can we approach\n                            &gt; towards it\n       =\r\n                     &gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishad=\r\ns\n                            &gt;\n                            &gt; regards\n     =\r\n                       &gt; jitender\n\n                         \n       \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0303_01C92C80.60D46CA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid;=\r\n PADDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PA=\r\nDDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDIN=\r\nG-TOP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mk=\r\np HR {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BOR=\r\nDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #=\r\nhd {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; =\r\nLINE-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {=\r\n\n\tPADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: =\r\n0px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgCo=\r\nlor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;For those who do not realize it, the word &quot;Swamiji&quot; \nin the first epi=\r\nsode with a rupee note under the pillow refers to Swami \nVivekananda (Naren=\r\ndranath Datta then).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The person in the second episo=\r\nde below is Swami \nYogananda (Jogindra Nath Roy Chaudhury).

Once \n        Swamiji=\r\n wanted to test Thakur. Since Thakur used to say that he could \n        not=\r\n handle money (as it represented something grossly material), Swamji \n     =\r\n   deliberately put a note under Thakur&#39;s pillow when Thakur was not in the=\r\n \n        room. Later when Thakur come to sleep in teh bed, he instantly go=\r\nt up as \n        if in pain and said something is very wrong in here, Hrida=\r\ny, who was \n        used to be there, searched the bed and found that money=\r\n under his \n        pillow. But Thakur never got offended with these things=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Infact in one instance, when one of his disciples had come to him \n =\r\n       for the first time, Thakur asked him to stay over at Dakshineshwar. =\r\nAt \n        night the disciple woke up and saw that Thakur was leaving the =\r\nroom. A \n        doubt entered the disciples mind, he thought maybe Thakur =\r\nis goinfg \n        towards the Nahabat house where Sri Sarada Ma used to st=\r\nay. So he \n        quitely decided to follow Thakur and see where he is goi=\r\nng, after all it \n        maybe that Thakur used to visit the Nahabat secre=\r\ntly etc etc.. he was \n        genuinely suspicious. Then as he left the roo=\r\nm following Thakur at a \n        distance, he saw Thakur going to the Panch=\r\nvati and sitting down for \n        meditation and there he sat for two hour=\r\ns.Later when Thakur came back, \n        he told that person, who later beca=\r\nme his disciple, that he had done \n        very good to test Thakur. Furthe=\r\nr Thakur said, no one should accept a \n        Guru without testing. And to=\r\n see and judge a person&#39;s sprittuality he \n        has to be observed when =\r\nhe is public and when he is alone.
