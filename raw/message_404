Probably because th=\r\nis is a Chaturdasi, that too a Saturday night, the homam was more pleasant =\r\nthan usual. I cannot sleep after this one right away and so let me type one=\r\n more mail.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf one is an aghori who does not care a=\r\nbout anything and is willing to go through any terrible experience and stil=\r\nl take it as Her blessing, then several things can go into fire. But others=\r\n should never put red chillies in homam fire. Those who throw red chillies =\r\nin fire and think that their petty problems will go away are fooling themse=\r\nlves. Whatever you put in external fire is actually going into your interna=\r\nl fire also. People having awakened shakti and subtle perception may realiz=\r\ne it and others may not realize it. But it is a fact. Now the impact of red=\r\n chillies on your internal fire is not at all a desirable one. One may not =\r\nbe realizing it because the karma may be going at the end of a long pipelin=\r\ne of karmas and give its result in far future, possibly even in a future li=\r\nfe.\n \nMy sincere advice to all: Never ever put spicy substances like red ch=\r\nillies and black pepper in a homam fire, even if you are worshipping a fier=\r\nce deity. Respectfully ignore advice from anyone to use black pepper and re=\r\nd chillies to solve your problems. That practice does NOT solve any problem=\r\ns and in fact creates further problems in future.\n \n*        *        *\n \nB=\r\ny the way, Pratyangira is not a &quot;&quot;bali kavar Deivam&quot; (deity wanting animal =\r\nsacrifice). It is what people of this age made her to be. Pratyangira, as I=\r\n described earlier, is a powerful deity who can fill one with pure sattwa. =\r\nUnfortunately, she is misunderstood and her mantras and vidya are so abused=\r\n and misused these days. That is why I felt compelled to write the last mai=\r\nl. The allegory is actually quite appropriate.\n \nI did not write the mail t=\r\no criticize Pratyangira sadhana. I wrote the mail and the allegory to criti=\r\ncize Pratyangira sadhana *as done* by many people today and to put things i=\r\nn perspective. People don&#39;t even understand what Pratyangira is for and wha=\r\nt she can do.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding balis (animal sacrifices), =\r\nI want to say one thing. In the old days, yogis who sacrificed animals were=\r\n capable of taking some karmas of the animal being sacrificed and give it m=\r\noksha or atleast a much higher birth after the sacrifice. In other words, t=\r\nhere was a give and take of karmas. Now-a-days, those who sacrifice animals=\r\n have no such spiritual caliber. They are only taking the life of the anima=\r\nl (bodily life which is something very dear to every being that self-identi=\r\nfies with a body very strongly, i.e. animals and human beings) and not givi=\r\nng anything in return. This causes a big karmik debt that needs to be paid =\r\nback later. Thus, one should think seriously before sacrificing an animal i=\r\nn this age.\n \nSome places have sthala maahaatmya. The power of the place, t=\r\nhe power of the sadhana performed by elevated beings there and the power of=\r\n an alive deity there ensure that karmas are balanced even when animals are=\r\n sacrificed. Such places are few. An example may be Kamakhya.\n \nAt other pl=\r\naces, a yogi with no caliber to take on the animal&#39;s karmas and give it a h=\r\nigher birth should stay away from animal sacrifice.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nIf you read Saptashati, the last chapter describes how the king and the va=\r\nisya kept chanting devi sooktam for 3 years on a river bank. It talks about=\r\n the &quot;bali&quot; (sacrifice) they gave:\n \n&quot;dadatustau balim chaiva nijagaatraasr=\r\nugukshitam&quot;\n \nIt means &quot;and they gave a sacrifice (bali) that was soaked wi=\r\nth blood from *their own* bodies&quot;.\n \nSee, *that* would be something.\n \nBest=\r\n regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam=\r\n\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.S=\r\nriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Radhakrishnan Jambunatha =\r\n\n  To: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com ; Narasimha P.V.R. \n  Sent: Saturday, Sep=\r\ntember 13, 2008 9:42 PM\n  Subject: Re: [sivacharya] Misconceptions on Praty=\r\nangira Homam\n\n\n\n        Dear  Sri. P.V.R.N.Acharyaji,\n        Namaskaram\n  =\r\n      Very well said. Now a days people seek quick solutions leaving aside =\r\nthe golden path of daily Sadhana. The result is that many temples particula=\r\nrly in Tamil Nadu with archaelogical importance are allowed to remain in ru=\r\nins and people pour several lakhs in building new temples for Devatas like =\r\nPratyingira, Sarabeswara etc. and publish widely homams to propitiate these=\r\n deities. As you have rightly said these deities occupy a special place.  I=\r\nn fact, the greatest of Devi Upasaka Sri Abirami Bhattar of Tirukadaiyur of=\r\n Abirami Andhadhi firm laments in his Andhadhi (meaning each stanza beginin=\r\ng with the end of previous stanza&#39;s last word) that he shall not leaving th=\r\ne lotus feet of Sakthi, waste his efforts after &quot;bali kavar Deivangal&quot; ( wh=\r\no demand some weird occult sacrifice).  That sums of what you have beautifu=\r\nlly and tellingly exposed in your letter.  Some Vaishnavite Scholars like V=\r\nelukudi Krishnan Swamiji in his discourses decry such practices. Whatever b=\r\ne the purana behind Pratyingira, it is not ordined for the general mass to =\r\ngo after such devatas leaving the Bhagawath Githa saying &quot;patram pushpam Yo=\r\n me bhaktya&quot; offers to Lord Narayana.  It is not my aim to decry such pract=\r\nices.  But when an easy path is shown in our scriptures, why invoke special=\r\n deities purely for personal aggrandisement and mundane objects.  In a famo=\r\nus place as Tirunageswara near Kumbakonam known from yore the Great Nageswa=\r\nra Temple known for its Raghu Sthala and Uppiliappan Temple (Oppilathaappan=\r\n Temple=3D Purushothama=3DSri Venkatachapathi), a small Pratyingira temple =\r\nin its outskirts has shot into prominence where it is alleged a woman ex ch=\r\nief Minister of Tamil Nadu was reported to have performed homam with chilli=\r\nes on an amavasya day to gain political ascension and the priest therein ha=\r\ns reportedly gained lot of prominence sporting toyoto van etc.  More people=\r\n flock to that place nowadays having their individual person specific agend=\r\na. In this scenario, you have pointed out the obvious. Many thanks for this=\r\n service\n        J.R.Krishnan \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0109_01C9160B.F8E7EC50\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY b=\r\ngColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;I just came back from my daily Chandi homam. \nProbably because thi=\r\ns is a Chaturdasi, that too a Saturday night, the homam was \nmore pleasant =\r\nthan usual.

Now a da=\r\nys people seek quick solutions leaving \n        aside the golden path of da=\r\nily Sadhana. The result is that many temples \n        particularly in Tamil=\r\n Nadu with archaelogical importance are allowed to \n        remain in ruins=\r\n and people pour several lakhs in building new temples \n        for Devatas=\r\n like Pratyingira, Sarabeswara etc. and publish widely homams \n        to p=\r\nropitiate these deities. As you have rightly said these deities \n        oc=\r\ncupy a special place.&nbsp; In fact, the greatest of Devi Upasaka Sri \n    =\r\n    Abirami Bhattar of Tirukadaiyur of Abirami Andhadhi firm laments in his=\r\n \n        Andhadhi (meaning each stanza begining with the end of previous s=\r\ntanza&#39;s \n        last word) that he shall not leaving the lotus feet of Sak=\r\nthi, waste his \n        efforts after &quot;bali kavar Deivangal&quot; ( who demand s=\r\nome weird \n        occult&nbsp;sacrifice).&nbsp; That sums of what you have=\r\n beautifully and \n        tellingly exposed in your letter.&nbsp; Some Vais=\r\nhnavite Scholars like \n        Velukudi Krishnan Swamiji in his discourses =\r\ndecry such practices. \n        Whatever be the purana behind Pratyingira, i=\r\nt is not ordined for the \n        general mass to go after such devatas lea=\r\nving the Bhagawath Githa saying \n        &quot;patram pushpam Yo me bhaktya&quot; off=\r\ners to Lord Narayana.&nbsp; It is not \n        my aim to decry such practic=\r\nes.&nbsp; But when an easy path is shown in \n        our scriptures, why in=\r\nvoke special deities purely for personal \n        aggrandisement and mundan=\r\ne objects.&nbsp; In a famous place as \n        Tirunageswara near Kumbakona=\r\nm known from yore the Great Nageswara Temple \n        known for its Raghu S=\r\nthala and Uppiliappan Temple (Oppilathaappan \n        Temple=3D Purushotham=\r\na=3DSri Venkatachapathi), a small Pratyingira temple in \n        its outski=\r\nrts has shot into prominence where it is alleged a woman ex \n        chief =\r\nMinister of Tamil Nadu was reported to have performed homam with \n        c=\r\nhillies on an amavasya day&nbsp;to gain political ascension and the \n      =\r\n  priest therein has&nbsp;reportedly&nbsp;gained&nbsp;lot of prominence \n  =\r\n      sporting toyoto van etc.&nbsp; More people flock to that place nowada=\r\nys \n        having their individual person specific agenda.
