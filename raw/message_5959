I was then staying as a\n&gt; paying guest with a family. though i had a sepa=\r\nrte room, i was not sure if\n&gt; they would allow me to do something related t=\r\no fire. that was the main\n&gt; worry. then there was self doubt concerning my =\r\nability to perform Homam but\n&gt; I decided to perform and did the first Homam=\r\n which was Maha Ganapati homam\n&gt; on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I remembe=\r\nr that i took me around 2.5 hours\n&gt; total including all the preparation aft=\r\ner that rest of the 8 days, i\n&gt; performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam =\r\ntook around 4 hours. I remember\n&gt; that on the Ashtami day, some of My colle=\r\nagues with family came to see my\n&gt; chandi Homam and they told me that the s=\r\nmoke was even visible in the ground\n&gt; floor (The Apartment i was staying wa=\r\ns on 4th) and there were nice smell\n&gt; every where. The interesting thing is=\r\n that Old lady of the family actually\n&gt; co-operated with me. she used to he=\r\nlp me in cutting Dray coconut in to small\n&gt; peices with knife. I cut my fin=\r\nger on several occasions while cutting\n&gt; coconuts for chandi homam. I used =\r\nto offer the blood stained coconut peices\n&gt; in Chandi Homas.\n&gt;\n&gt; My all pre=\r\nvious fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very\n&gt; first Homa=\r\nm, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could\n&gt; not co=\r\nntinue and there was a break of a week or so. Then again i started\n&gt; daily =\r\nMaha Ganapti Homam while learnt the technic of breaking Dry coconut\n&gt; halve=\r\ns by crushing it with both palms.\n&gt;\n&gt; After few months, I had to look for a=\r\nnother Sharing Apartment. I tried to\n&gt; search for it. few families rejected=\r\n when i put the condition of doing Homam\n&gt; everyday. at last One christian =\r\nfamily agreed for that. I paid bigger amount\n&gt; but they allowed me to do ho=\r\nmam and i continued there for around 3 months.\n&gt; during that time i also to=\r\nok vow to do homam and Chadni Path everyday for 1\n&gt; year.\n&gt;\n&gt; after 3 month=\r\ns, i started searching for my own separate Rental Apartment\n&gt; because my fa=\r\nmily was joining me. Again the same concern (Prime) is to\n&gt; search for Apar=\r\ntment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand\n&gt; new apartment=\r\n. I observed the flat and finalised the dealing. continued\n&gt; Homam every da=\r\ny for 1 year. The whole flat became black. even the Home\n&gt; applicances liem=\r\n refrigerator etc.. were covered with black dust of Homa\n&gt; smoke. clothes i=\r\nn the wardrobe, Openings of Central A/c etc... were all\n&gt; filled with black=\r\n dust. My whole brand new apartment became dark due to the\n&gt; Homam. Smoke p=\r\narticles travelled to my lungs and throat and i started\n&gt; coughing badly. I=\r\n suffered with severe Cough for many months and there was\n&gt; pressure from n=\r\near ones to stop Homam or atleast perform it once every week.\n&gt; But there w=\r\nas lot of determination provided by *some power* which i like to\n&gt; call as =\r\n&quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching different =\r\nplace. I\n&gt; searched whole area and was looking for a apartment which also h=\r\nas Balcony\n&gt; so that My homam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtme=\r\nnt look black\n&gt; and there are no more complaints from my wife .\n&gt; I could n=\r\not get one such perfect place which gives me a Blacony and at the\n&gt; same ti=\r\nme there are no buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam\n&gt; in ba=\r\nlcony and make a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade.\n&gt; Balcony=\r\n was very comfirtable and required option so that i can do it there\n&gt; and s=\r\nmoke handling becomes very easy but at the same time it is also that\n&gt; much=\r\n risky because any road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming\n&gt; out=\r\n.\n&gt; Finally i got one aprtment without balcony but with a special location.=\r\n\n&gt; When i vacated the previous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was\n&gt; =\r\nshell-shocked looking at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over\n=\r\n&gt; Phone - &quot;Aaap Kya karata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my=\r\n\n&gt; deposit for the compensation. I happily agreed because i knew that it wa=\r\ns a\n&gt; great deal instaed of going to police station.\n&gt;\n&gt; In new Apartment (=\r\ncurrent one), security is very tight. But I decided to\n&gt; make an arrangemen=\r\nt so that i do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment.\n&gt; hence i came out w=\r\nith the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in\n&gt; photo section) =\r\nand started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible to\n&gt; neighbours and =\r\nother flat owners, no body has complained till now. neither\n&gt; to police nor=\r\n to security personnel. Only once Security person cautiuoned\n&gt; me. I stoppe=\r\nd for a few days and started as usual. It is going on till\n&gt; today. I do no=\r\nt know about tomorrow but i do not worry. becuase after 2.5\n&gt; years of expe=\r\nrience, it is more than clear to me that It is not I who is\n&gt; arranging all=\r\n these but there is Mother behind all these. SHE is making my\n&gt; road clear =\r\nso that i can perform Homam as i wish.\n&gt;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; The moral of the story is =\r\nthat if you genuinely desire to perform\n&gt; Homam/Havan, then It will be done=\r\n.
