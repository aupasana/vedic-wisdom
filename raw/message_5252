( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if those channels are not=\r\n clean then that energy flow can create unpleasant experiences like increas=\r\ned anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.\n\nRishis have=\r\n clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and blessings =\r\nthey give are just part of divine will. like curse given to lord vishnu by =\r\nsage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses given to yadav vansh and=\r\n king prikshit played an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy except f=\r\new times when he was markedly irritated.Like in an incidence where one of h=\r\nis female disciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in front of h=\r\nim to learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that=\r\n his student did not learnt well what he taught to her. \n\nOn other side peo=\r\nple with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be able to handle th=\r\nat energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like ravana an=\r\nd sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i personally believe that this is also=\r\n part of divine will. \n\nPlease forgive me for my mistakes\n\nRegards\nAtul\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
