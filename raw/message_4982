Moreover, the liberating experience may come after =\r\na lot of sadhana.\n  \nGo ahead and do it. Happy birthday!\n \n&gt; (2) Whether th=\r\ne puja lamp can be lit at the start of the day (as is the\n&gt; usual practice)=\r\n and pitr tarpana done after lighting lamp (of course, in a\n&gt; different pla=\r\nce other than the puja mandir)?\n \nYes, pitri tarpana can be done after ligh=\r\nting the lamp or doing a homam.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNamaste Rajesh,\n \n&gt;=\r\n 1. Is it ok to do tarpan ( pouring water for tarpan and all) besides havan=\r\nkund? or at the same place of havankund?\n \nYes.\n \n&gt; 2. While doing tarpan v=\r\nidhi, is it ok if in the middle of tarpan vidhi, =C3=82 i put ghee to havan=\r\nkund for maintaining fire so that=C3=82 sopari ( which is used=C3=82 for pu=\r\nrnahuti)=C3=82 can be burned totally?\n \nWait till the homam is completely f=\r\ninished and everything burns. Then start the other ritual.\n \n&gt; 3. I am norm=\r\nally doing vishnu homam and tarpan vidhi both in my bedroom. In pitru tarpa=\r\nn manual it is written that during shraddha paksha ( this fortnight) there =\r\nis no harm in doing tarpan vidhi in house also..is this ok?\n \nIt is ok. How=\r\never, it is better to do pitri tarpana in another place. People&#39;s minds are=\r\n quite vulnerable when they are asleep, to various influences. When you do =\r\na pitri tarpana or otherwise contemplate on the ancestors who are blocked f=\r\nrom higher realms of being, you may be leaving some thoughts related to the=\r\nm and their weaknesses in that place. That is normally harmless, but a very=\r\n sensitive person sleeping there may be somewhat disturbed by it.\n \n&gt; 4.=C3=\r\n=82 Lacking knowledge of sanskrit,=C3=82 chanting of shlokas from manual an=\r\nd giving tarpan is becoming most of the time mechanical. I feel no devotion=\r\n there.=C3=82 Is it ok,=C3=82 if=C3=82 i pray in my mind=C3=82 =C3=82 in my=\r\n mother tongue=C3=82 to all devas, pitrus and rishis to accept my pitru tar=\r\npan and requesting them to not to be obstacles in my spiritual progress and=\r\n material progress?\n \nYes, it is ok. You did not know the procedure earlier=\r\n, but now you know it. You do not know the meanings now, but you will know =\r\nit later, when the time comes. Knowledge and ability to act on it come in s=\r\ntages. Grab whatever comes to you..\n \n&gt; 5. My gotra is Kaudinya gotra? it c=\r\nan not be seen=C3=82 in pitru manual? can u help me which rishi=C3=82 my go=\r\ntra belong to?\n \nThe name of your gotra rishi then is Koundinya. :-)\n \nThe =\r\nrishi tarpana section in the Pitri tarpana manual only includes the Saptars=\r\nhis. You can add your gotra rishis if you want. At the end of of &quot;rishi tar=\r\npana&quot;, you can add &quot;OM kauNDinyaH tR^ipyataaM&quot;.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNam=\r\naste Sriram,\n \n&gt; Just one more query\n&gt; As per the manual, before offering i=\r\ns made to Pitris, the Sesame seeds should be added to the pot. Now, the pot=\r\n already has akshats lying at the bottom, is it fine to add sesame seeds as=\r\n well to the same pit, or separate pot is to be used?\n \nYou can use the sam=\r\ne pot/vessel/kalasham.\n \n&gt; Also, if the water has reduced in the pot after =\r\nofferings to Devas and Rishis, is it OK to add more water to the pot (if sa=\r\nme as asked in previous question) before start offering to Pitris?\n \nYes, y=\r\nou can add more water.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNamaste Bhupendra ji,\n \n&gt; At=\r\n the end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said in conclusion:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there some m=\r\np3 that would help in learning how to say this?\n \nGood point. I will try to=\r\n record the MP3 audio.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free J=\r\nyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.=\r\norg\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyo=\r\ntish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
