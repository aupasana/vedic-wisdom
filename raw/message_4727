Thus, worship of deities, \n&gt;de=\r\nmigods, \n&gt;\n&gt; xians, supernatural beings (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris=\r\n!) as practiced \n&gt;in \n&gt;\n&gt; these folk religions were not replaced by Confuci=\r\nan philosophy but they \n&gt; co-existed. Moreover, Confucianism stressed hones=\r\nty, rituals and rites (which \n&gt; extended to proper social behavior), sacrif=\r\nice and filial piety.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, even if Chinese may not explicitly believe=\r\n in a specific definition of \n&gt; God, an implicit concept of god has influen=\r\nced the evolution of the value \n&gt; system, philosophy and culture they so fa=\r\nithfully followed.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, communist rule changed things=\r\n.

That is why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not=\r\n deserve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the service of paramhamsas now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid o=\r\nur understanding of the word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nwan is supposed to able to remove water from milk. Similarly, a \n&gt;paramaham=\r\nsa \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;(absolute swan) is one who can extract out the bad in a person and=\r\n leave him \n&gt; &gt;with the good that is already in him. In other words, a para=\r\nmahamsa is one who \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;can interact with ANYONE (with any degrees of good=\r\n and bad) and transform one \n\n&gt; &gt;into an ideal person. For example, Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa associated with \n&gt; &gt;drunkards and womanizers like Girish a=\r\nnd Kalipad and transformed them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks the world does =\r\nnot deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a \n&gt;cave, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;one may be great an=\r\nd realized, but not a paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact,=\r\n look at Parasara&#39;s directives on finding a paramahamsa. He said \n&gt; &gt;Mercur=\r\ny in 5th from karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Jupiter?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and adap=\r\ntive. Mercury can identify \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;with anyone. Mercury is compassionate and =\r\ncan place himself in the shoes of \n&gt; &gt;anyone and think/feel like that perso=\r\nn. That is also why Mercury is the karaka \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;for good communication skil=\r\nls. A good communicator can visualize from the \n&gt;angle \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;of his audienc=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna once identified with grass so strongly that whe=\r\nn a crow walked \n&gt;on \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the grass, there were bloody scratches on his bo=\r\ndy. Such ability to identify \n&gt; &gt;with someone else is needed for transformi=\r\nng someone else. That is why \n&gt;Parasara \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;mentioned Mercury for Paramah=\r\namsa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas e=\r\nven today.

Creating a Chandragupta is easy for someone of Chanakya&#39;s \n&gt;=\r\n caliber.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Rajarshi on this. If a Chanakya is on e=\r\narth and ready to guide \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Chandragupta, a Chandragupta would automatica=\r\nlly come. If a Samartha Ramadas \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;on earth and ready too guide Shi=\r\nvaji, a Shivaji would automatically come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, Swami Vivek=\r\nananda once humbly said that Ramakrishna could have \n&gt; &gt;created one thousan=\r\nd Vivekanandas from sand!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All your statem=\r\nents in this thread are true, but sometimes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differences in our lang=\r\nuage create unnecessary confusions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find your s=\r\ntatements to be absolutely true.

But I was presenting \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\ndifferent perspective to balance the presentation of ideas. However, the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;bottomline is that it is never possible to articulate this knowledge \n&gt;pe=\r\nrfectly, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;using vaikhari. Knowledge like this can be digested and abso=\r\nrbed only though \n&gt; &gt;experience and not through reading or hearing words sp=\r\noken in vaikhari. But \n&gt; &gt;then, words spoken in vaikhari can serve the impo=\r\nrtant purpose of inspiring \n&gt;one, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;perhaps to investigate and/or to do=\r\n sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no alternative to sadhana, whether meditati=\r\non or homam or \n&gt; &gt;contemplation or hatha yoga or whatever.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rhetorical Question, Vinay_ji...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If ALL=\r\n references of GOD were to be possibly wiped out from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collectiv=\r\ne memory of humanity -- All kinds and forms of Gods and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their NAMES=\r\n really ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How would the world and society look, feel, be=\r\nhave, act or react?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Religion has two purposes: (1) Enable some=\r\n seekers to experience Self and \n&gt; &gt;become liberated and (2) maintain some =\r\nsanity, righteousness and order in the \n\n&gt; &gt;world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If there is=\r\n no concept of god, no faith in god and no faith in after-life, \n\n&gt; &gt;world =\r\ncan then degenerate into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pursuit of \n&gt; &gt;s=\r\nelfish needs of each person.

But a self-realized soul burns away his/her \n\n&gt; &gt;entire previous hist=\r\nory of Karmas and Samskaaras and therefore does not NEED \n&gt; &gt;rebirth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Liberated souls and incarnations of divine agencies come again =\r\nand again \n\n&gt; &gt;NOT for obeying Prakriti blindly, but for Loka-samgraha, for=\r\n which the entire \n\n&gt; &gt;Creation was created. They gain nothing in return. R=\r\ngveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas \n\n&gt; &gt;tapati Tapyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tap=\r\na for gaining something material \n&gt;or \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;spiritual. But why the Surya is=\r\n performing Tapa? What Surya will gain? \n&gt; &gt;Loka-samgraha, because the Sury=\r\na perceives all other souls as its own parts \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;wants their well b=\r\neing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving o=\r\nbjects of duality, \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;yet remain in oneness with the underlying on=\r\neness//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is the proper way of living in this worl=\r\nd for a self realized \n&gt; &gt;soul. There is no alternative in this world. One =\r\ncannot remain in perpetual \n&gt; &gt;nirvikalpa samadhi in this world. But it is =\r\nnot proper to call the former as a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;higher state&quot;. It is not advisabl=\r\ne to discuss real Samadhi in a public fora. \n\n&gt; &gt;These things are taught by=\r\n a spiritual Guru to the disciple according to the \n&gt; &gt;propensity and abili=\r\nty of the latter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you have used the term &quot;higher state&quot;=\r\n, let me say that the highest \n&gt;state \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;of samadhi is indeed that type =\r\nof samadhi which was attained in battlefield by \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;entire dynasty of Ram=\r\na, and for sometime by Arjuna. It is &quot;Yoga of the \n&gt; &gt;Rajarshis&quot; according =\r\nto Gita, which had vanished from this world after \n&gt;Ikshvaku \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;dynasty =\r\nand was temporarily given to Arjuna after a long absence during entire \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Dvapar yuga. There were many rishis and paramhamsa in Dvapar. But only Ar=\r\njuna \n\n&gt; &gt;attained Rajarshi-yoga. Lord Krishna was not a yogi, He was and i=\r\ns the aim of \n\n&gt; &gt;all yogas (=3DCommunion).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find y=\r\nour statements to be absolutely true. But greater clarity \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;needed=\r\n at some points to ward off possible confusions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -VJ\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D =3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Vinay ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gyani should live like a fool, away from limelight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limelight is a problem if it distracts one (and it does distract =\r\nmost). \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When electricity is turned off, a lamp may g=\r\no off immediately.

What a gyani d=\r\noes *after* self-realization varies from one gyani \n&gt;to \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;another.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A self-realized Janaka may rule a kingdom, a self-realized=\r\n Arjuna may \n&gt; &gt;fight a battle, a self-realized Vasishtha may become a raja=\r\nguru, a \n&gt;self-realized \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vivekananda may tour the world and teach veda=\r\nnta, another self-realized yogi \n&gt;may \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;remain hidden in a cave in Hima=\r\nlayas, and another self-realized yogi may live \n\n&gt; &gt;like a fool begging out=\r\nside a temple. What a self-realized person does is \n&gt; &gt;dependent on the pre=\r\nvious history of that soul and what Nature expects from \n&gt;one. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;As one=\r\n&#39;s individual Ego and individual Will efface, one becomes an instrument \n&gt;o=\r\nf \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;nature, like a dry leaf floating in the air.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though rishis and gods such as Shiva and Vishnu a=\r\nre liberated, their \n&gt; &gt;amshas still come down to earth now and then to aff=\r\nect important changes, in \n&gt; &gt;accordance with the will of Nature and Natura=\r\nl Order (niyati). They retain \n&gt;their \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;identity till the end of the cr=\r\neation cycle and yet are ever liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am quoting =\r\na relevant writeup from message 438 of vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt;yahoogroup titled &quot;=\r\nRishis&quot;:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that our sense=\r\ns perceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the \n\n&gt; &gt;power of duality.=\r\n If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and \n\n&gt; &gt;all is ON=\r\nE uniform and undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or \n&gt; &gt;Bra=\r\nhman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided consciousness=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is known as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality, where ther=\r\ne are many \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;different objects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brah=\r\nman that went \n&gt;through \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;some modification and manifestation. It is kn=\r\nown as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;are Brahman only.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Normally, living in the domain of duality without being deluded by some=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;aspect of duality or the other is near to impossible. Remaining in d=\r\nuality \n&gt;with \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;a perfect understanding of the underlying oneness of al=\r\nl objects and \n&gt;perceiving \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;all those objects of duality without exper=\r\niencing attraction or repulsion for \n\n&gt; &gt;any single object of duality is al=\r\nmost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants \n&gt;try \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to reach the state of=\r\n oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which \n&gt;there \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is no d=\r\nuality and no objectification - and become absorbed in that state \n&gt; &gt;forev=\r\ner. That is the advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what \n&gt; &gt;ha=\r\nppens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, maharshis have described h=\r\nigher states. It is possible to be \n&gt;in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;oneness with manifested Brahm=\r\nan and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;possible to rem=\r\nain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, \n\n&gt; &gt;and yet=\r\n remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or repulsion f=\r\nor any \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the senses is=\r\n not the \n&gt;problem. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The tendency of mind to be find some attractive a=\r\nnd find some repulsive is the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;problem. It is possible to remain in a =\r\nstate where there is neither attraction \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;nor repulsion for any object =\r\nis possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a state is experienced by very few b=\r\neings. Ramakrishna \n&gt;Paramahamsa, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this st=\r\nate always. Swami Vivekananda also \n&gt; &gt;experienced it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Rishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are always \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duali=\r\nty \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overco=\r\nmes attraction and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pret=\r\nty much do anything. But \n&gt; &gt;because one is neither attracted or repelled b=\r\ny anything, it means one has no \n\n&gt; &gt;personal ego and one has no reason to =\r\ndo anything for personal ego. Then one \n&gt; &gt;becomes an instrument of nature =\r\n(Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature \n&gt; &gt;through one&#39;s actions, whi=\r\nch are performed without any attachment or personal \n\n&gt; &gt;identification. On=\r\ne who has a personal ego can do limited things. One who has \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;very =\r\nvery small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do ANY thing. \n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the natural or=\r\nder of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the universe. They can change the course of history of nations=\r\n and planets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rishi in this state may engage in vari=\r\nous actions of great \n&gt;consequence \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;for the world. Yet, there is no at=\r\ntachment with the actions. He is just an \n&gt; &gt;unattached instrument of Natur=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed=\r\n in unmanifested \n&gt; &gt;Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi wh=\r\no has an equal vision of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for e=\r\nver mukta (liberated). Thus, he \n&gt;will \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;freely interact with duality w=\r\nithout any fear or aversion. Amsa of such a \n&gt;rishi \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;may even be born =\r\nagain as a separate person, just as a process running in a \n&gt; &gt;computer may=\r\n spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task. Even if the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;co=\r\nmputer process has finished all the initialization and early work, the newl=\r\ny \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again. Similarl=\r\ny, the \n&gt;person \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;born with amsa has to go through the process of overc=\r\noming weaknesses and \n&gt; &gt;realizing self all over again. When a Vivekananda =\r\nis born from the amsa of a \n&gt; &gt;rishi, he may have to struggle initially and=\r\n overcome the weaknesses and \n&gt;realize \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;self all over again. But he is=\r\n the amsa of an ever free and liberated being \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;will find his way=\r\n again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his=\r\n liberated consciousness \n\n&gt; &gt;and with the force of his reborn amsas, will =\r\nact as an unattached instrument \n&gt;of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Nature performing actions of tre=\r\nmendous consequences without any personal ego \n\n&gt; &gt;driving those actions.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna specifically said six of his disciples=\r\n were ever \n&gt; &gt;liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe full message can be read at:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rishis&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ..spiritual Guru of Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vasishtha, Viswamitra and Rama were all gyanis.

For startes, the =\r\ndunces would be in confederacy \n&gt;against \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;them. When \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Vivekanada, before he became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;bitterly \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed by the &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city=\r\n on various issues. \n&gt; &gt;Then a young \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not-yet-famous Vive=\r\nkananda got angry and decided he will leave Kasi \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and never \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return to that city untill he &quot;falls on society like a \n&gt;thunderbo=\r\nlt&quot;. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Well, that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is precisely what he did. He fell =\r\non Indian society like a \n&gt; &gt;thunderbolt, after \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which th=\r\nose very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, asking him to come \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;grace=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their city! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let us kee=\r\np our fingers crossed and not=C3=83=C6=92=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C2=AC=C3=85=C2=A1 focus on \n&gt;emtpy \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;speculations, rather \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; wait for the most interesting coming=C3=83=C6=92=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=85=C2=A1 decade to unfold in \n&gt;all \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;its=C3=83=\r\n=C6=92=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=85=C2=A1 sound and fury.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die=\r\n, what would be your name and religion and \n&gt; nationality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though religion usually stays the s=\r\name, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;it CAN \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change. Nationality can of course chan=\r\nge too. Job, skills, external \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;nature, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks, gende=\r\nr, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;all change \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basicall=\r\ny, the seed of one&#39;s new birth is formed at the time of \n&gt;one&#39;s \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;death=\r\n. As \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s connection is severed with the body, the last=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;desires/thoughts/ponderings \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the mind become the =\r\nseed for the next life. Nature chooses for \n&gt;one \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;a future \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course that allows one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed =\r\n\n&gt;by \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous karmas and debts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is able to not entertain ANY desire as one element =\r\nafter \n&gt; &gt;another \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one bec=\r\nomes liberated. All the \n&gt; &gt;spiritual sadhana \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do is a=\r\n dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall=\r\n recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I and =\r\nyou like each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet \n&gt; &gt;each other, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they will start off taking a liking to each other. If I an=\r\nd you \n&gt; &gt;dislike each \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other and your rebirth and my reb=\r\nirth meet each other, they will \n&gt; &gt;start off \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disliking =\r\neach other. This will happen without either being \n&gt; &gt;consciously aware of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who one was and who the other person was, in the last li=\r\nfe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, if your question is how we can re=\r\ncognize that so and so \n&gt; &gt;person is a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami =\r\nVivekananda, so and so person is a rebirth of \n&gt; &gt;Paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne reborn person may not look like the old person or do similar \n&gt;work \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;or have \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much *external* similarity. So it is difficult =\r\nto &quot;recognize&quot; one. \n\n&gt; &gt;After all, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama advocated eka p=\r\natni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna \n\n&gt; &gt;had thousands \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wives. Rama was a great warrior and killed Ravana in the bigge=\r\nst \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;war of his \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times. Krishna was a key player in t=\r\nhe biggest war of his time, but \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;did not take \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a wea=\r\npon at all. The game can be diffent in each coming..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to recognizing the =\r\nrebirth of a great soul, it can \n&gt; &gt;become a trap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back after \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;100 years \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that everybody else who came with him =\r\nwould have to come back \n&gt; &gt;with him. When \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada Mata a=\r\nnd Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did not have a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;choice! Even \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to come back =\r\nonce more. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Master \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I am to come back once =\r\nmore with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you \n&gt;have \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to come \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied, &quot;souls like \n&gt;that \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;have great \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ramak=\r\nrishna said that people \n&gt; &gt;would get \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberated en masse=\r\n during his next coming and that would be the \n&gt;last \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;opportunity \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time to come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Intere=\r\nstingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of \n&gt; &gt;Ramakrishna \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Anot=\r\nher good \n&gt; &gt;saint \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnat=\r\nion of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai \n\n&gt; &gt;Baba said \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he ide=\r\nntified a particular young man as the reincarnation of \n&gt; &gt;Swami \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more \n&gt;=\r\nthan \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;twenty \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disciples of a very high caliber and d=\r\nifferent aptitudes. Together, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;they nearly \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded =\r\nthe direction of spiritual India for the next century. None \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;of the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by people of such =\r\ncaliber \n&gt;or \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;fit the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nsoul! It is not \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are lying. They may simply be =\r\ndeluding themselves and of \n\n&gt; &gt;course ego is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the root o=\r\nf delusion!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, is it necessary to recogn=\r\nize whether X is a rebirth of Y, \n\n&gt; &gt;given that X \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Y=\r\n are different and play a different game? A small discussion \n&gt;on \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;thi=\r\ns point \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can =\r\nbe found in:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though external factors like nationality, religion, name, job, \n=\r\n&gt;looks, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;gender etc \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can change, some internal facto=\r\nrs may remain the same. Moreover, \n&gt;who \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;one likes, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n who one dislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, etc, \n\n&gt; &gt;ma=\r\ny remain \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; essentially the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim \n&gt; &gt;em=\r\nperor Akbar \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu an=\r\nd the other was a \n&gt;Muslim. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both were ver=\r\ny brave, unafraid of death, inherently spiritual, had \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;refined \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous \n&gt;=\r\nconnections \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;with \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Akbar being b=\r\norn and raised when his mother was \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;hiding at a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raj=\r\nput household, before moving to Delhi.

For example, Han dynasty declared Confucia=\r\nnism as the official state &lt;BR&gt;&gt; culture and Taoism as the official reli=\r\ngion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; xians, supernatural bein=\r\ngs (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; these fol=\r\nk religions were not\n replaced by Confucian philosophy but they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; co=\r\n-existed. Moreover, Confucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; extended to proper social behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus, even if Chinese may not explicitly believe in a spec=\r\nific definition of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God, an implicit concept of god has influenced =\r\nthe evolution of the value &lt;BR&gt;&gt; system, philosophy and culture they so =\r\nfaithfully followed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Of course, com=\r\nmunist rule changed things.

That is why&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that=\r\n the world does not deserve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the service of\n paramham=\r\nsas now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid our understanding=\r\n of the word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Swan is supposed to able to remove water from milk. Similarly, a par=\r\namahamsa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;(absolute swan) is one who can extract out the bad in=\r\n a person and leave him &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;with the good that is already in him. =\r\nIn other words, a paramahamsa is one who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;can interact with ANY=\r\nONE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;into =\r\nan ideal person. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;drunkards and womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed th=\r\nem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks the world does not d=\r\neserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;one may be great an=\r\nd realized, but not a paramahamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, look at\n Parasara&#39;s direct=\r\nives on finding a paramahamsa. He said &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Mercury in 5th from kar=\r\nakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Jupite=\r\nr?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is fle=\r\nxible and adaptive. Mercury can identify &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;with anyone. Mercury =\r\nis compassionate and can place himself in the shoes of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;anyone =\r\nand think/feel like that person. That is also why Mercury is the karaka &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;for good communication skills. A good communicator can visualize =\r\nfrom the angle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;of his audience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Ramakrishna once identified with grass so strongly that when a crow =\r\nwalked on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the grass, there were bloody scratches on his body. =\r\nSuch ability to identify &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;with someone else is needed for trans=\r\nforming someone else. That is why Parasara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;mentioned Mercury f=\r\nor Paramahamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas even today. Th=\r\nere is, however, not a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;single &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Chandragupta now. Few &quot;experts&quot;, if any, know that Chanakya was a &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;paramhamsa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhu.

If a Chanakya is on earth and ready to guide=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Chandragupta, a Chandragupta would automatically come.

But I wa=\r\ns presenting a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;different perspective to balance the presentati=\r\non of ideas. However, the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;bottomline is that it is never possi=\r\nble to articulate this knowledge perfectly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;using vaikhari. Kn=\r\nowledge like this can be digested and absorbed only though &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;exp=\r\nerience and not through reading or\n hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;then, words spoken in vaikhari can serve the important purpose =\r\nof inspiring one, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;perhaps to investigate and/or to do sadhana.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no alternative to sadhana, w=\r\nhether meditation or homam or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;contemplation or hatha yoga or w=\r\nhatever.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rhetorical Question, Vinay_ji...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If ALL references of GOD were to be possibly wiped =\r\nout from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collective memory of humanity -- All ki=\r\nnds and forms of Gods and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their NAMES really ---&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How would the world and society=\r\n look, feel, behave, act or react?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rel=\r\nigion has two purposes: (1) Enable some seekers to experience Self and &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;become liberated\n and (2) maintain some sanity, righteousness and =\r\norder in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If th=\r\nere is no concept of god, no faith in god and no faith in after-life, &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;world can then degenerate into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pu=\r\nrsuit of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;selfish needs of each person. However corrupted, reli=\r\ngion and fear of god bring &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;some sanity and order to the world!=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is true that some religions and so=\r\nme ideas of god may have degenerated &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;very badly and causing mo=\r\nre harm than benefit. If so, such religions and ideas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;will be =\r\ncleaned up by the Natural Order when time comes, to be replaced by &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;better ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons,\n Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;VJha&quot; &lt;vinayjha=\r\na16@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimh=\r\na,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All your statements in this thread are true,=\r\n but sometimes differences in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;our language create unnecessary =\r\nconfusions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Gyani should li=\r\nve like a fool, away from limelight&quot; : this statement of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Brahm=\r\nopanishada is a general rule which needs no IF like &quot;if limelight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;duistracts one&quot;, because if limelight distracts, then the person is not=\r\n a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;full-fledged Gyani. To LIVE in limelight as a general rule =\r\nis foolishness for a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Gyani, but sometimes Gyanis may come into=\r\n limelight for some specific cause; it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;is the cause they care =\r\nfor and not the limelight or lack\n of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; //What a gyani does *after* self-realization varies from one =\r\ngyani to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;another.//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Yes. Your keyword in &quot;What a gyani does&quot; is &quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma of a Gya=\r\nni. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;It is very difficult to understand KARMA, as Gita says. Pr=\r\noper definitions of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Karma, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are needed. S=\r\nince nobody can live without doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;something, as Gita says, wh=\r\nat is Akarma in fact? Whatever be the mode or type of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;action o=\r\nf a Gyani, it is done without any desire of fruit for self, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;therefore the actions of a Gyani should not be included in general Karma.=\r\n The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Karma which does not produce phala for the performer is A=\r\nkarma. Brahmasutra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;speaks of four types of Moksha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //What a self-realized person does is d=\r\nependent on the previous\n history of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;that soul and what Nature=\r\n expects from one.//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Both YE=\r\nS and NO! A self-realized soul has to bear whatever is written in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;his/her birthchart for THIS LIFE. But a self-realized soul burns away h=\r\nis/her &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;entire previous history of Karmas and Samskaaras and th=\r\nerefore does not NEED &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;rebirth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Liberated souls and incarnations of divine agencies come ag=\r\nain and again &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;NOT for obeying Prakriti blindly, but for Loka-s=\r\namgraha, for which the entire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Creation was created. They gain =\r\nnothing in return. Rgveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;tapati Tapyatu v=\r\nrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa for gaining something material or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;spiritual. But why the Surya is performing Tapa? What Surya will gain? &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;Loka-samgraha, because the Surya perceives all other souls as it=\r\ns own parts and\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;wants their well being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //to remain in duality, with the senses perceivin=\r\ng objects of duality, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;yet remain in oneness with the under=\r\nlying oneness//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is=\r\n the proper way of living in this world for a self realized &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;so=\r\nul. There is no alternative in this world. One cannot remain in perpetual &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;nirvikalpa samadhi in this world. But it is not proper to call =\r\nthe former as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;higher state&quot;. It is not advisable to discuss=\r\n real Samadhi in a public fora. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;These things are taught by a s=\r\npiritual Guru to the disciple according to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;propensity and =\r\nability of the latter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As yo=\r\nu have used the term &quot;higher state&quot;, let me say that the highest state &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;of samadhi is indeed that type of samadhi which was attained in ba=\r\nttlefield\n by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;entire dynasty of Rama, and for sometime by Arju=\r\nna. It is &quot;Yoga of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Rajarshis&quot; according to Gita, which had=\r\n vanished from this world after Ikshvaku &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;dynasty and was tempo=\r\nrarily given to Arjuna after a long absence during entire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Dvap=\r\nar yuga. There were many rishis and paramhamsa in Dvapar. But only Arjuna \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
