I advice them to read his post-com=\r\npilation book to get a better idea of Narasimha ji&#39;s point of view.\n\nPerson=\r\nally, I think Narasimha ji&#39;s teachings contain &#39;core essence&#39; of spirituali=\r\nty which is common in all the religions and paths but unfortunately not hig=\r\nhlighted in most of the paths now a days. most probably this is the reason =\r\nfor misunderstandings and conflicts.\n\nPlease forgive me for my mistaken and=\r\n wrongly choosen words.\n\nRegards\nAtul\n\n\n"}}
