The fire ritual in which physical materials are offered to deities in fire is dravya yajna (material sacrifice).\n \nThe real yajna is one where various actions that are performed based on one&#39;s dharma are sacrificed in the internal fire of wisdom (i.e. the knowledge that God acts through us). Of course, if one says &quot;god is doing this through me&quot; as a mere formality, but secretly entertains thoughts like &quot;I am doing this&quot;, &quot;I did it&quot; etc, then one is not really *sacrificing* the action. It is akin to pretending to throw some material into fire in a fire ritual, but not really throwing it or throwing it outside of the fire. It does not burn and does not reach god. Only materials thrown inside the fire and burnt fully will be considered to have been sacrificed to gods. Similarly, only if the sense of doership and ownership over an action is completely surrendered to god can we say that one has sacrificed that action in the internal fire of wisdom.\n \nLord is essentially saying below that actions performed without surrendering the doership to Lord completely become bondages and actions performed and completely sacrificed to Lord in the internal fire, i.e. completely surrendered to Lord, do not bind one. Whether you do a good act and a bad act, it binds you as long as you think that you are doing it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDepending on your dharma, what you do may vary. You may be teaching spiritual knowledge. You may be doing rituals for establishing sanatana dharma. You may be doing rituals for the victory of a ruler. You may be fighting an election to be a president. You may be fighting a physical war with enemies. You may be doing business and making money to build a temple. You may be begging on the streets and living with dogs. You may be doing anything. But, the key is to give up the doership to the Lord and erase the notion that &quot;I am doing&quot; completely from the mind. THAT yajna will keep you free from bondage.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn order to kindle the internal fire and make it burn well, we use an external fire as a symbol in the beginning. As we spend time with external fire, the internal fire is kindled by resonance. That is why an external fire ritual is recommended to sadhakas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding swa-dharma, two points:\n \nFirst point: One&#39;s varna may or may not be shown by the family of birth. One&#39;s varna is to be determined by one&#39;s aptitude and the direction in which one&#39;s conditioning pulls one.\n \nSecond point: A brahmana&#39;s job is not just to do rituals. A brahmana&#39;s job is to pursue knowledge and self-realization and become a beacon of knowledge for the society. One can do that by engaging in rituals for dharma in the society or teach people or just do tapascharya or so many other things.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough Krishna&#39;s directive to Arjuna has been interpreted in the context of varnashrama or, loosely speaking, caste system, it is not so simple. Krishna asked Arjuna to follow &quot;swa-dharma&quot;, i.e. one&#39;s own dharma, and avoid paradharma, i.e. other people&#39;s dharma. It is not that there are four kinds of dharma in the world. Each person has one&#39;s own dharma, that is decided based on who one has been in previous lives, what karmik debts one has, what desires and conditioning one has, and what abilities one has. Each person has a unique dharma.\n \nBut it is not easy to find what exactly one&#39;s dharma is! Arjuna was lucky and had a guru like Krishna, who told him his dharma was to kill those armies of relatives, gurus, elders etc. Shankaracharya was lucky to have a guru like Govinda Bhagavatpada, who told him he had to write commentaries on Vedic literature and debate. Vivekananda was lucky to have a guru like Ramakrishna who begged him not go to Himalayas and asked to spread the knowledge of Sanatana Dharma in India and abroad.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHow do we find what *our* dharma is? It is not easy! If you have a trusted guru, follow him/her. Otherwise, follow the internal guru, i.e. the instincts from your conscience. Unfortunately, one sees one&#39;s dharma clearly only if one is pure. And, one becomes pure only if one fulfills most of one&#39;s dharma. This is a catch-22 situation.\n \nThe simplest algorithm is to listen to your trusted guru (an external person or internal conscience), discharge the dharma as said by guru and try to increase surrender and detachment in actions. As detachment increases and some dharma gets fulfilled, purity increases and clarity on what one&#39;s dharma is increases. As that happens, one can become more detached. And so on. If one keeps doing this patiently and keeps doing sadhana and contemplation, one will eventually break through into right track.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear everyone, \n&gt; \n&gt; I have just realized that geeta in the chapter karma yoga, constantly talks about yagna (homa?) as the main activity and also asserts that whoever is not doing homa is just adding his karma all the time. \n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, 3.9 states that \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karmabandhanah\n&gt;  tadartham karma kaunteya mukasangah samachara&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; which roughly translates to &quot;karmas other than those for yagna (homa) are only going to increase the bondage and hence you should only that karma that is meant for yagna&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now this in arjuna&#39;s case means that he should just do the war, as that is his yagna! \n&gt; \n&gt; In my case, does that mean that I should leave my job as a software engineer and keep doing homas, and chanting vedam as that is my vihita karma as I am a brahmin by birth? \n&gt; \n&gt; Verse 13 also goes to say that I am only eating sin if I am doing something outside of vedam to get my bread, which I am clearly doing by working as an IT professional in the USA! Does this mean that we should all leave what we are doing and go back to our native places and keep doing our kula vritti as defined by our vihita karmas as defined by our scriptures? I am very confused and need PVRjis help to understand this better. \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj\n\n\n"}}
