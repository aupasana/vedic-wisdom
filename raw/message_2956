Was that all during the\nperiod you were on the hill?=94\n\nBhagavan: =93Y=\r\nes. That was perhaps when I was in the Virupaksha Cave. I closed\nmy eyes. I=\r\n felt I was walking on the hill itself towards the northeast. I\nsaw at one =\r\nplace a nice flower garden, a big temple, a fine compound wall\nand a big Na=\r\nndi (a bull carved in stone). There was a strange light. It was\nextremely p=\r\nleasant. As I was looking at all these, it was time for puja\n(worship). The=\r\n bell was rung and immediately after that I opened my eyes.=94\n\nDevotee: =\r\n=93Bhagavan told us some time back that there was a big cave also.=94\n\nBhag=\r\navan: =93Yes, yes. That also happened when I was living on the hill. I was\n=\r\nwandering about aimlessly when I found at one place a big cave. When I\nente=\r\nred the cave, I saw a number of waterfalls, beautiful gardens, tanks\nwithin=\r\n those gardens, well laid paths, fine lighting; everything there was\nmost p=\r\nleasing. As I went farther and farther I saw a Realised Person (Siddha\nPuru=\r\nsha) seated like Dakshinamurthy under a tree on the banks of a tank.\nAround=\r\n him, a number of saints (munis) were seated. They were asking\nsomething an=\r\nd he was replying to them. That place appeared to me very\nfamiliar. That is=\r\n all. I opened my eyes. Subsequently,after some time, when\nI saw Arunachala=\r\n Puranam in Sanskrit in the two slokas that cave and that\nSiddha Purusha ha=\r\nve been described and so I was surprised that what appeared\nto me in a tran=\r\nce was to be found in that book. So I translated them into\nTamil: =91Angiyu=\r\nru vayumoli mangugiri yaga...=92. Its meaning is: =91Though you\nare in the =\r\nform of fire,you have kept away the fire and have taken the shape\nof a hill=\r\n mainly to shower your blessings on the people. You are always\nliving here =\r\nin the form of a Siddha. The cave that appeared to me is in you\nwith all th=\r\ne luxuries of the world.=92\n\nRecently when the temple in Adi Annamalai was =\r\nrenovated,it has been reported\nthat in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple =\r\na large tunnel was found and\nwhen people tried to find out its extent they =\r\nsaw that it was extending to\nthe very centre of the hill.\n\nAs they could no=\r\nt go in very far, they came back. I therefore thought that\nwhich occurred t=\r\no me and that which is in the Purana appears to be true and\nthat the tunnel=\r\n was the way to the place I had seen. It is reported that\nSiddha Purushas c=\r\nome from the cave inside to the temple through that tunnel\nnight after nigh=\r\nt and go back after worshipping Ishwara. Why so far?\nRecently, something li=\r\nke that was seen even here. I was going on to the hill\nas usual when, as I =\r\nwas getting near the steps over there, a big city\nappeared before me. There=\r\n were huge buildings of several varieties, well\nlaid thoroughfares, good li=\r\nghting; and it appeared to be a great city. At\none place a meeting was bein=\r\ng held. Chadwick was with me. He was even\nsaying, =91Bhagavan,all this is s=\r\no self-evident! Who will believe if we say\nthis is all a dream!=92 Everythi=\r\nng appeared as if it was actually happening.\n\nMeanwhile, I opened my eyes.=\r\n=94\n\nDevotee: =93Is all this really a dream?=94\n\nBhagavan: =93I can=92t say=\r\n whether it is a dream or not.What is real?=94\n\nSource: Letters from Sri Ra=\r\nmanasramam VOLUMES I, II & Letters from and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasram=\r\nam By SURI NAGAMMA Translated by D.
