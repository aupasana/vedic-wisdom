That is why we used terms like mantra-siddhi \n(realizing a mantra=\r\n), or some other apparently miraculous/supernatural \nability.=C2=A0And the =\r\nword siddha is=C2=A0often used=C2=A0to describe someone who has some such \n=\r\nability.\n=C2=A0\nThis definition of a Siddha is incorrect. It is a corruptio=\r\nn which has entered \nour thought-process over centuries, just like every ot=\r\nher spiritual person who \nuses an epithet Rishi is not really a Rishi.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nSo who is a Siddha really? One who has acquired some miraculous ability=\r\n? Nope. \nTechnically a Siddha is one who has taken his awareness (Kundalini=\r\n) to the \nSahashrar Chakra, thus experiencing Nirvikalpa, and THEN bringing=\r\n the awareness \nback to the lower chakras. In this process, he often acquir=\r\nes *degrees of \nmastery* over the five elements of the chakras. That is a t=\r\nrue Siddha.=C2=A0Aghora \npart 2 very clearly defines, (same is also hinted =\r\nat in some other books too), \nthis in much details. There is absolutely no =\r\nscope of ambiguity here, unless one \nrefuses to accept the book as valid (f=\r\nine by me).=C2=A0Like it says, what is the \ndifference between a gyani and =\r\na vigyani? A gyani experiences the state of \nNirvikalpa and realizes &quot;All i=\r\ns Brahman&quot;. But it is one thing to realize &quot;all is \nbrahman&quot;, it is another=\r\n thing to acquire some of the shaktis of Brahman. \n\n=C2=A0\nFor example, con=\r\nsider a glass of water and an ocean. Both of them have the same \nchemical c=\r\nompostion (H2O). Realizing this is realizing &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. But an \nocea=\r\nn can sustain and create a Tsunami, a glass of water cannot, even if it \nwa=\r\nnts to. Of course it=C2=A0may often never have a desire to do so in the fir=\r\nst \nplace!=C2=A0However that is the difference, technically, between a gyan=\r\ni and a \nvi-gyani. And the whole process of a Siddha and higher starts ONLY=\r\n=C2=A0AFTER someone \nis able to bring the Kundalini back from Sahashra chak=\r\nra to the lower chakras \nagain. Needless to say, for most of us ordinary pe=\r\nople, even getting a Kundalini \nto awaken is a big deal, taking it to Shaha=\r\nshrar is already too hi fi and may \ntake lifetimes, bringing is back is imp=\r\nossible/unthinkable totally.\n=C2=A0\nWhat happens when a person becomes a Si=\r\nddha by the parameter described above? It \nis impossible to imagine. He/she=\r\n operates from a plane of reference so different \nthat ordinary folks just =\r\ncannot fathom. Infact, most of us can&#39;t even fathom \nwhat samadhi feels lik=\r\ne until experienced, what to speak of siddha-hood. \n\n=C2=A0\n_______________=\r\n___________________________\n=C2=A0\nA Trilanga Swami did tri-khanda yogas, c=\r\nuts his limbs, puts them=C2=A0into fire and \neventually the limbs regenerat=\r\ne. Even Sai Baba did a similar thing. Is this a \nsiddhi (miraculous ability=\r\n) or a sadhana? To us average folks, anything out of \nthe ordinary seems mi=\r\nraculous. The internet itself would appear \nsupernatural/miraculous a few c=\r\nenturies ago! \n\n=C2=A0\nTherefore, one who reaches a state of Siddha-hood, w=\r\nill automatically produce \nexternal effects which appear miraculous to ordi=\r\nnary people. Not like he/she \nis=C2=A0specifically trying for it, but it is=\r\n a byproduct of a totally different \ninternal=C2=A0reference frame. Hence t=\r\nhe crucial difference between a &quot;gyani&quot; and a \n&quot;vigyani&quot;. \n\n=C2=A0\nTo give =\r\nan example from physics, if you could move at speeds close to that of \nligh=\r\nt, you will see things elongating, time becoming slower, you will age less,=\r\n \netc etc.=C2=A0If you could move at speeds higher than that of light, you =\r\nwill observe \neffects of an action even before the action happens.=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0A supremely altered \nreference frame creates external effects which are =\r\nextraordinary and appear \nmiraculous to observers who are in a different re=\r\nference frame. This is the \nreality of the world. No amount of philosophy c=\r\nan change this.\n=C2=A0\n____________________________________________________=\r\n____\n=C2=A0\nEvery spiritual book has a point of view and an audience. Same =\r\nwith Aghora. One \nmay like=C2=A0it or one may not like it. But there is zer=\r\no scope of saying \nVimalananda knew something else=C2=A0and book creates a =\r\ndifferent impression etc etc. \nNothing=C2=A0of that sort. The chapter on Im=\r\nmortals in book 2 is very, very clear and \nvery direct. It is not possible =\r\nto interpret it any other way. \n\n=C2=A0\nOur scriptures have plenty of stori=\r\nes of miraculous things done by and \nassociated with Rishis. Did they have =\r\na desire from past lives? Which past life, \nwhen Rishis are eternal?

To me, it is a natural byproduct of their vastly \ndiff=\r\nerent internal state of being. Not something they may have strived for, but=\r\n \nsomething that accompanies and manifests externally corresponding to thei=\r\nr \ninternal=C2=A0mastery over the=C2=A0elements.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Raja=\r\nrshi\n\nBazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\nHota hain shab-o-roz tamasha =\r\nmere aage\n=C2=A0\nEk khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\nEk baat hain i=\r\njaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thu, 4 A=\r\nugust, 2011 1:13:01 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] One more key point (Re: On S=\r\niddhis & Spiritual Progress)\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste,\n=C2=A0\nAn interesting point =\r\ncame up in a private exchange with a couple of folks and I \nwill write it d=\r\nown for the benefit of others.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIt is not like =\r\n&quot;you get so & so siddhi when you reach so & so level&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nSiddhis come =\r\nbecause one DESIRED them in this or a PREVIOUS life.

Such blanke=\r\nt statements are incorrect \n&gt; and gloss over nuances and create a totally w=\r\nrong picture. \n=C2=A0 \nWhat I said is not a &quot;blanket statement&quot;, but an exp=\r\nlicit teaching of Vasishtha \nto Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is also absolu=\r\ntely consistent with Upanishadic \nlearning. \n\n=C2=A0 \nYou talk about taking=\r\n the words of a great instead of speculating. In fact, did \nVimalananda *ex=\r\nplicitly* write that Ramakrishna is only a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; and not \na siddha =\r\nor a natha or a rishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or natha or \nsiddha =\r\nor paramahamsa, and so on? In my case, my statement above is explicitly \nan=\r\nd unambiguously stated by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda&#39;s question &quot;w=\r\nill \nsiddhis help me in god realization&quot; in the negative, Ramakrishna also =\r\naffirmed \nthis teaching of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentially refers to th=\r\ne same thing in \nBhagavad Gita when he talks about seeking small things fro=\r\nm demigods vs seeking \n&quot;me&quot; (Self). Vaishtha&#39;s words, however, are the clea=\r\nrest and most unambiguous. \n\n=C2=A0 \nYoga Vaasishtham was taught by Vasisht=\r\nha to Lord Rama in the presence of \nVishwamitra and other great sages and r=\r\necorded by Valmiki. It is the highest \nwatermark of spiritual knowledge. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nAghora series is nice, but can give wrong notions to some who may t=\r\nend to be \nfascinated by external miracles. I have no doubt that Vimalanand=\r\na had no \nconfusions himself, but some people reading those books can form =\r\nmisconceptions \n(though it is still ok if that makes them do sadhana. The o=\r\nnly problem is if \nthey start doing the bad karma of making negative judgme=\r\nnts on greats thinking \nthey are blindly following Vimalananda). It is a go=\r\nod idea to balance the \nperspective with some Vedantic understanding such a=\r\ns Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad \nGita. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Infact it also violates a =\r\npoint which you yourself made in an earlier mail. The \n&gt;\n&gt; external is conn=\r\nected to the internal. Some siddhis are not possible unless one \n&gt;\n&gt; attain=\r\ns a very rarified level of realization. And they manifest externally. \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \nYes, some external siddhis are possible only at a very rarefied level =\r\nof \nrealization. But some with the same or higher level of realization may =\r\nnot \npossess the same external siddhi. Thus external miracles cannot be use=\r\nd as \nmeasures of one&#39;s level. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThis is like the analogy I gave of=\r\n collecting fruits from the trees on the side \nof the road to the hilltop. =\r\nSome keep tavelling on the road and accept only \nthose fruits that land in =\r\ntheir lap by themselves. Some get distracted from the \njourney and pursue t=\r\nhe fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neither necessary \nnor sufficient =\r\nfor reaching the top. Though having a fruit that is available \nonly at a ve=\r\nry high altitude shows that one has reached great altitude, it \ncannot be u=\r\nsed as a measure of one&#39;s progress, for someone may have climbed \ngreater h=\r\neights without collecting that (or any) fruit. \n\n=C2=A0 \nExternal and inter=\r\nnal do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence. Just as you \ncannot tell what =\r\nis inside a house by looking at it from outside, so cannot you \ntell one&#39;s =\r\nstate of mind from looking at one. One&#39;s spiritual maturity and \nattainment=\r\n is in one&#39;s state of mind. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \n&gt; If a loved =\r\nand revered spiritual figure is percieved to be questioned, \n&gt; naturally a =\r\nreaction is expected.

Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came=\r\n down. An \namsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of the Ris=\r\nhi&#39;s \nconsciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and once the purp=\r\nose is \nserved, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. T=\r\nherefore, \nvery technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a p=\r\nrojection of a \nRishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Na=\r\nths, Munis etc are \nprojection Rishis one way or the other. Each is kept is=\r\n ingorance of their real \nbeing (Rishi) such that the play can go on (not m=\r\ny words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). \nThey are Nitya-siddha because even if they =\r\ntake birth over and over, being parts \nof extremely higher beings, these em=\r\nanations/projections/amsas will surely \neventually go back to the source wh=\r\nen the work is done. \n\n=C2=A0 \nHowever, in their forms as specific individu=\r\nals like Vivekananda, whether these \namsa attain the specific stages which =\r\nmakes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will \ndetermine if they are to be called so.=\r\n They may not need to do so since they are \nhere for a purpose. But, the on=\r\nly way a person can be called a siddha in true \nsense is when he, as Vimala=\r\nnanda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific \nshaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and mov=\r\nes closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it, \ndeeper and deeper.=C2=\r\n=A0 \n\n=C2=A0 \nThere is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a certa=\r\nin sadhaka (his \ndisciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to stay in =\r\nthe Swargadwara \nsmashana and later someone build a small ashram for him. T=\r\notapuri&#39;s ashram still \nexists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri also=\r\n mentions a similar ideas of \nwhat is a siddha and higher. And how only a S=\r\niddha and none less is a true \nVigyani. He further mentions that Swami Vive=\r\nkananda did not (need) to go to the \nstage of a Siddha. His work was specif=\r\nic, he did the work and went off. He did \nnot need to and therefore did not=\r\n become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. \n\n=C2=A0 \nAdded to this the fa=\r\nct that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the \ndisciples of Ramakrshn=\r\na were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual \nbeing, and higher t=\r\nhan them. Here too I see no confusion. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;It is not necessary that=\r\n there is a clear order of greatness.

For Yogis, t=\r\nhere maybe subtle differences and depths. The truth lies \nin the nuances. A=\r\nnyway, Vivekananda&#39;s own words are more reliable for me than \nyours on this=\r\n matter. And my previous explanation actually clarifies this \nstatement of =\r\nSri Ramakrishna that Vivekananda was the &quot;ancient Rishis Nara&quot; who \ncame do=\r\nwn for the good of mankind. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;Wise men tread cautiously and do no=\r\nt rush to judgment on others.&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nI am merely quoting and putting to=\r\ngether the analysis, statements of spiritually \ngreat people.

Thi=\r\ns is a delicate area where many have \nmisconceptions and I will try to addr=\r\ness them. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nMaharshi Vasishtha&#39;s teaching =\r\nto Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The \ngoal of existence and sadha=\r\nna is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither \nspecifically sought nor =\r\nspecifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature \ngives one some siddhi=\r\n(s), one should accept them with neither excitement nor \ndisappointment. Bu=\r\nt one should NOT run after them, for they are neither \nnecessary nor suffic=\r\nient for self-realization and liberation. \n\n=C2=A0 \nVivekananda used the sa=\r\nme principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give his \nsiddhis to Vivekananda=\r\n. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize \ngod. Ramakrishna=\r\n said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, \nwhen Rama=\r\nkrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda&#39;s two \naction=\r\ns demonstrate Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \nLet us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one&#39;s spir=\r\nitual \nsadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the =\r\nhill from \ndifferent sides and using different paths. There may be trees wi=\r\nth nice fruits \non the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special abili=\r\nties. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIf one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and colle=\r\ncting fruits, one&#39;s \njourney gets delayed and one may not reach the top. Th=\r\nat is why Vasishtha says a \nseeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nBut if some fruits fall in one&#39;s lap by themselves, one can keep th=\r\nem. \nSimilarly, siddhis that come to one by themselves can be accepted by a=\r\n seeker of \nSelf. \n\n=C2=A0 \nNow an important distinction: \n=C2=A0 \nThere ar=\r\ne some trees that are found at lower altitudes also, but some really \nspeci=\r\nal trees are found at very high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it=\r\n \nshows that one has climbed great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not =\r\nmean \nmuch, but some siddhis are very special and only really elevated sadh=\r\nakas can \nobtain them (whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas =\r\ndemonstrates \nsuch a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. However=\r\n, the key is that \none who climbed the same or more distance may not have t=\r\nhat or any other fruit. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nUnlike in the ex=\r\nample of climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual \nprogress =\r\nin real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure \nho=\r\nw much progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally and =\r\n\nwhat exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind. We may try to judge it from external f=\r\nactors \nsuch as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nHere, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one&#39;s sid=\r\ndhis to judge \nhow high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person who rea=\r\nched the absolute \ntop may not have any fruits, while one person who still =\r\nhas ways to climb may \nhave gotten some really nice fruit. Using externasll=\r\ny demonstrable siddhis that \nare neither necessary nor sufficient for Self-=\r\nrealization as a measure of one&#39;s \nprogress is unsound. \n\n=C2=A0 \nGiven tha=\r\nt spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and compare \npeople t=\r\nhen? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarvaantaryaami - a \nperfecte=\r\nd being who has access to each being&#39;s internal state - can do that. \n\n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nRajarshi, you are assuming that Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on \nVimalananda&#39;s scale. You are concluding tha=\r\nt Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; \nAbhedananda, Vivekananda etc are lower tha=\r\nn that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and \nhence Vimalananda is superior to Abhed=\r\nananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIs Paramahamsa Nithyananda=\r\n, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa \nbecause he is known =\r\nso? See, how people are famously known may or may not \nreflect their spirit=\r\nual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you \ncannot see it. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nWe do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not be=\r\n just a \nparamahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, but be a siddha or a natha or =\r\neven a rishi. \nHe may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some r=\r\neligious experts of \nthat time declared based on various signs. If Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa is Vishnu \nhimself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can defini=\r\ntely be rishis or naths in \nVimalananda&#39;s scale. If your argument is that t=\r\nhey cannot be because they did \nnot demonstrate siddhis compatible with tha=\r\nt status, that is a non-point as I \nexplained above. The disagreement betwe=\r\nen then boils down a difference in the \nrelevance and importance of externa=\r\nlly demonstrated siddhis. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nWhy this is r=\r\nelevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to \nhave mis=\r\nconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing \nmira=\r\ncles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. \n\n=C2=A0 \nVasishtha is =\r\nnot only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught \nLord R=\r\nama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will \n=\r\nbalance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis =\r\nare \nneither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don&#39;t be distra=\r\ncted by \nthem or be infatuated with them. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThe goal of sadhana is =\r\nthat your notions of &quot;this is I and these are mine&quot; get \nsubtler and subtle=\r\nr and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and \nweaker. Other=\r\ns may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you \nknow your=\r\n progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no \nre=\r\nlevance or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your \nsad=\r\nhana. \n\n=C2=A0 \nBest regards, \nNarasimha \n---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------- \n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, \n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana: \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitt=\r\ner ID: @homam108 \n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------- \n=C2=A0 \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a long friendly ;-)=\r\n exchange between Rajarshi and me on Friday \n&gt; (July 29) on twitter on meas=\r\nuring spiritual caliber. This came from the \n&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s commen=\r\nts on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding th=\r\neir attitude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and said=\r\n their spiritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was =\r\n2 power 16. He also talked about \n&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber ment=\r\nioned by V. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of musings on that. \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------- \n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here a=\r\nre a few comments on your statements a couple of days \n&gt; back on Twitter co=\r\nmparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, =\r\nrose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n&gt; which is a better flower. T=\r\nhey have different properties like color, \n&gt; size, shape, number of petals,=\r\n type/intensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; values depend on the purpose and =\r\nthey cannot be quantified universally. \n&gt; How can any sane person then say =\r\nthat spiritual caliber of different \n&gt; people can be compared and quanitifi=\r\ned? The field of duality has \n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of =\r\na yogi has infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual cal=\r\niber of a person as one \n&gt; number and compare them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even a=\r\nttempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha =\r\n&lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for=\r\n deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; where Vishnu is supr=\r\neme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some c=\r\nonsider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None =\r\nof them is absolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; and for specific purposes,=\r\n i.e. from a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; people who take them as abs=\r\nolute and argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so =\r\nand so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; know that none of the hierarch=\r\nies is absolute. \n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare =\r\nthe wisdom of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of=\r\n Ramakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion o=\r\nf Shirdi Sai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri M=\r\nahashaya, \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of E=\r\nknath \n&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, =\r\netc, \n&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific =\r\n\n&gt; limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n=\r\n&gt; another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n=\r\n&gt; on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n&gt; =\r\nYou should just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n&gt; o=\r\nf them that you like the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from=\r\n specific perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, his words should make one reali=\r\nze that there is always \n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resultin=\r\ng mastery over the field \n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One sh=\r\nould never rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gos=\r\npel and starting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially maki=\r\nng statements like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put to=\r\ngtr&quot; and thinking \n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda i=\r\ns assumed to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Even if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume =\r\n\n&gt; that you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramak=\r\nrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per =\r\nVimalananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or =\r\nmay be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; th=\r\ne details we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; statu=\r\nre based on his own classification? \n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal t=\r\no each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You=\r\n probably made this statement based on \n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimala=\r\nnanda. For the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he wa=\r\ns a real person or an imagined \n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and ver=\r\ny wisely!) left the latter \n&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book=\r\n! \n&gt; \n&gt; If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a =\r\n\n&gt; simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \n&gt; =\r\none&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; t=\r\nold Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \n&gt; =\r\nback, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \n&gt; on=\r\ne more birth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; th=\r\ne other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \n&gt; w=\r\naiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; A=\r\nbhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda! \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that =\r\nthis is just one definition. One can have many \n&gt; definitions. The key is n=\r\not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is w=\r\neightier than Y and so what he said must \n&gt; be more correct&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; People =\r\nwith lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \n&gt; to be =\r\nabsolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \n&gt; are doi=\r\nng the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t=\r\n fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n&gt; absolute. Writte=\r\nn words are always relative and never absolute. \n&gt; Discriminate relative kn=\r\nowledge using intellect at first and hopefully \n&gt; using experencial realiza=\r\ntion later on. \n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;ma=\r\nturity&quot;, we should \n&gt; not commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental =\r\ncomments of greats \n&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lo=\r\nt more than us. \n&gt; ------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, \n&gt; N=\r\narasimha \n\r\n--0-876920484-1312455002=:81096\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Some=\r\n thoughts on Siddhas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0=\r\n00000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;It is not like &quot;you get so &amp; so siddhi wh=\r\nen you reach so &amp; so level&quot;.&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dle=\r\nft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;Before we go further, let us define what is&nbsp;=\r\n&quot;siddhi&quot; and what is a&nbsp;&quot;siddha&quot;. Siddhi means accomplishment. That is =\r\nwhy we used terms like mantra-siddhi (realizing a mantra), or some other ap=\r\nparently miraculous/supernatural ability.&nbsp;And the word siddha is&nbsp;=\r\noften used&nbsp;to describe someone who has some such ability.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV a=\r\nlign=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;This definition of a Siddha is in=\r\ncorrect. It is a corruption which has entered our thought-process over cent=\r\nuries, just like every other spiritual person who uses an epithet Rishi is =\r\nnot really a Rishi.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVe=\r\nrdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;S=\r\no who is a Siddha really? One who has acquired some miraculous ability? Nop=\r\ne. Technically a Siddha is one who has taken his awareness (Kundalini) to t=\r\nhe Sahashrar Chakra, thus experiencing Nirvikalpa, and THEN bringing the aw=\r\nareness back to the lower chakras. In this process, he often acquires *degr=\r\nees of mastery* over the five elements of the chakras. That is a true Siddh=\r\na.&nbsp;Aghora part 2 very clearly defines, (same is also hinted at in some=\r\n other books too), this in much details. There is absolutely no scope of am=\r\nbiguity here, unless one refuses to accept the book as valid (fine by me).&=\r\nnbsp;Like it says, what is the difference between a gyani and a vigyani? A =\r\ngyani experiences the state of Nirvikalpa and realizes &quot;All is Brahman&quot;. Bu=\r\nt it is one thing to realize &quot;all is brahman&quot;, it is another thing to acqui=\r\nre some of the shaktis of Brahman. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT si=\r\nze=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3DVerdana&gt;F&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;or example, consider a=\r\n glass of water and an ocean. Both of them have the same chemical compostio=\r\nn (H2O). Realizing this is realizing &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. But an ocean can sus=\r\ntain and create a Tsunami, a glass of water cannot, even if it wants to. Of=\r\n course it&nbsp;may often never have a desire to do so in the first place!&=\r\nnbsp;However that is the difference, technically, between a gyani and a vi-=\r\ngyani. And the whole process of a Siddha and higher starts ONLY&nbsp;AFTER =\r\nsomeone is able to bring the Kundalini back from Sahashra chakra to the low=\r\ner chakras again. Needless to say, for most of us ordinary people, even get=\r\nting a Kundalini to awaken is a big deal, taking it to Shahashrar is alread=\r\ny too hi fi and may take lifetimes, bringing is back is impossible/unthinka=\r\nble totally.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;What hap=\r\npens when a person becomes a Siddha by the parameter described above? It is=\r\n impossible to imagine. He/she operates from a plane of reference so differ=\r\nent that ordinary folks just cannot fathom. Infact, most of us can&#39;t even f=\r\nathom what samadhi feels like until experienced, what to speak of siddha-ho=\r\nod. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;________________=\r\n__________________________&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 fa=\r\nce=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVe=\r\nrdana&gt;A Trilanga Swami did tri-khanda yogas, cuts his limbs, puts them&nbsp=\r\n;into fire and eventually the limbs regenerate. Even Sai Baba did a similar=\r\n thing. Is this a siddhi (miraculous ability) or a sadhana? To us average f=\r\nolks, anything out of the ordinary seems miraculous.
