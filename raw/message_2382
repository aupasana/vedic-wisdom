This was one of the last few desires expressed by =\r\nVivekananda before he gave up his body.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aurobindo said that he had a v=\r\nision of Vivekananda in his prison cell and that Vivekananda explained some=\r\n things to him. It is interesting that Aurobindo came up with a sublime com=\r\nmentary on some Vedic verses in later years..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Do not trust =\r\nany commentary on Veda. More so the one at the website you mentioned. I che=\r\ncked out a few verses. The translations given by them are usually quite sil=\r\nly. Ignore that website.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Commenting on a verse from Veda is=\r\n different. It is not merely an intellectual activity requiring scholarship=\r\n and logical thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot give a complete sense of what this ver=\r\nse is saying (will try later), but can give an overall big picture first. T=\r\nhe verses around this verse alternate between having Pururava as the rishi =\r\n(seer) and Urvashi as the devata (deity) and having Urvashi as the rishi (d=\r\neity) and Pururava as the devata (deity). This is an exchange between Purur=\r\nava and Urvashi as they pursued each other. You can read various puranic st=\r\nories about Pururava, the great king from Chandra vamsha, and Urvashi, the =\r\nbeautiful apsara (celestial nymph). They were attracted to each other and l=\r\nived together on earth. They are personifications of some qualities inside =\r\nus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Urvashi comes from ura and vasha. It means one who has the power t=\r\no control and pull the heart. Urvashi is personification of the attraction =\r\nthat pulls one&#39;s heart towards various objects in the field of duality. As =\r\na sadhaka does great tapascharya and starts to overcome duality, Urvashi is=\r\n sent to test one. Urvashi successfully seducing a sadhaka and disturbing h=\r\nis tapascharya means that the sadhaka succumbed to the power of attraction =\r\nthat pulled his heart towards objects and his heart desired something.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Pururava means a crying a lot or crying majestically. He is a personificat=\r\nion of the emotional nature and compassion within us. No wonder he is a kin=\r\ng in the Chandra vamsha. The solar and lunar lineages that are popular in t=\r\nhe scriptures have to do with the solar and lunar channels - Pingala and Id=\r\na (respectively) . Ida nadi is the channel of emotions, intuition, feeling,=\r\n compassion etc. So Pururava is from that lineage.\n&gt; \n&gt; While everyone is c=\r\nharmed by Urvashi - the power of attraction that binds one&#39;s heart, Urvashi=\r\n herself was charmed by Pururava, the majestic and noble king. Pururava res=\r\ncued Urvashi from a demon once. The majestic and noble quality of compassio=\r\nn saves the power of attraction from having to combine with meaner motives.=\r\n One&#39;s heart can be pulled towards various objects out of the spirit of sel=\r\nf-gratification (a demon) or out of kindness and compassion (Pururava). Whe=\r\nn compassion arises in one&#39;s heart, then the heart&#39;s attraction to others i=\r\ns driven by compassion rather than the spirit of self-gratification.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe verses you referred to are a dialog between the personification of compa=\r\nssion and personification of the power of attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart=\r\n towards various objects. This whole series of verses has to be interpreted=\r\n in abstract and internalized terms. It is not a commentary on men and wome=\r\nn at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; More later..\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.=\r\n home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 13, 2009 10:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Meaning of one verse from Rig Veda\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji and others\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Can you kindly explain the meaning of the following verse from the Rig V=\r\neda:\n&gt; \n&gt; pur=C5=ABravo m=C4=81 m=E1=B9=9Bth=C4=81 m=C4=81 pra papto m=C4=\r\n=81 tv=C4=81 v=E1=B9=9Bk=C4=81so a=C5=9Biv=C4=81sa uk=E1=B9=A3an | \n&gt; na va=\r\ni strai=E1=B9=87=C4=81ni sakhy=C4=81ni santi s=C4=81l=C4=81v=E1=B9=9Bk=C4=\r\n=81=E1=B9=87=C4=81=E1=B9=83h=E1=B9=9Bday=C4=81nyet=C4=81 || (Rig Veda Book =\r\n10, Hym XCV)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sacred- texts.com/ hin/rvsan/ rv10095.htm\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The english translation provided is as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 15 Nay, do not die, P=\r\nur=C5=ABravas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened wolves devour thee.\n&gt; Wi=\r\nth women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the heart=\r\ns of women.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sacred- texts.com/ hin/rigveda/ rv10095.htm\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Is this translation correct?

You can read various p=\r\nuranic stories about Pururava, the great king from Chandra vamsha, and Urva=\r\nshi, the beautiful apsara (celestial nymph). They were attracted to each ot=\r\nher and lived together on earth. They are personifications of some qualitie=\r\ns inside us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Urvashi comes from ura and vasha. It means on=\r\ne who has the power to control and pull the heart.\n Urvashi is personificat=\r\nion of the attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart towards various objects in the=\r\n field of duality. As a sadhaka does great tapascharya and starts to overco=\r\nme duality, Urvashi is sent to test one. Urvashi successfully seducing a sa=\r\ndhaka and disturbing his tapascharya means that the sadhaka succumbed to th=\r\ne power of attraction that pulled his heart towards objects and his heart d=\r\nesired something.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pururava means a crying a lot or crying =\r\nmajestically. He is a personification of the emotional nature and compassio=\r\nn within us. No wonder he is a king in the Chandra vamsha. The solar and lu=\r\nnar lineages that are popular in the scriptures have to do with the solar a=\r\nnd lunar channels - Pingala and Ida (respectively) .. Ida nadi is the chann=\r\nel of emotions, intuition, feeling, compassion etc. So Pururava is from tha=\r\nt lineage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; While everyone is charmed by Urvashi - the powe=\r\nr of attraction that binds one&#39;s heart,\n Urvashi herself was charmed by Pur=\r\nurava, the majestic and noble king. Pururava rescued Urvashi from a demon o=\r\nnce. The majestic and noble quality of compassion saves the power of attrac=\r\ntion from having to combine with meaner motives. One&#39;s heart can be pulled =\r\ntowards various objects out of the spirit of self-gratification (a demon) o=\r\nr out of kindness and compassion (Pururava). When compassion arises in one&#39;=\r\ns heart, then the heart&#39;s attraction to others is driven by compassion rath=\r\ner than the spirit of self-gratification..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The verses you =\r\nreferred to are a dialog between the personification of compassion and pers=\r\nonification of the power of attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart towards vario=\r\nus objects. This whole series of verses has to be interpreted in abstract a=\r\nnd internalized terms. It is not a commentary on men and women at all.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; More later..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; ------------ ---------\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org=\r\n/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ hom=\r\nam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastro=\r\nloger.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nvedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------\n --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message =\r\n----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.=\r\nmail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, July 13, 2009 10:54 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Meaning of one verse from Rig Veda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nDear Narasimhaji and others&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can you kindly explain the mea=\r\nning of the following verse from the Rig Veda:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pur=C5=ABra=\r\nvo m=C4=81 m=E1=B9=9Bth=C4=81 m=C4=81 pra papto m=C4=81 tv=C4=81 v=E1=B9=9B=\r\nk=C4=81so a=C5=9Biv=C4=81sa uk=E1=B9=A3an | &lt;BR&gt;&gt; na vai strai=E1=B9=87=\r\n=C4=81ni sakhy=C4=81ni santi s=C4=81l=C4=81v=E1=B9=9Bk=C4=81=E1=B9=87=C4=81=\r\n=E1=B9=83h=E1=B9=9Bday=C4=81nyet=C4=81 || (Rig Veda Book 10, Hym XCV)&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv10095.htm&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.sacred- texts.com/ hin/rvsan/ rv10=\r\n095.htm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The\n english translation provided is as follow=\r\ns:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 15 Nay, do not die, Pur=C5=ABravas, nor vanish: let not=\r\n the evil-omened wolves devour thee.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With women there can be no las=\r\nting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10095.htm&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.sacred- texts.com/ hin/rigveda/ rv10095.htm=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is this translation correct?
