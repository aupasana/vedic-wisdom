Assuming Apsaras cannot come to us in phys=\r\nical form at all, then how is it that our Puranas are full of incidents lik=\r\ne Rishis marrying Apsaras, Apsaras giving birth to children due to their ph=\r\nysical union with Rishis, etc.? Even some great kings are known to have had=\r\n the company of Apsaras. For example, Emperor Pururava was seduced by Urvas=\r\nhi Apsara. She lived with him for one year, and then disappeared, leaving h=\r\nim distressed. How all this can be explained? Any insightful ideas from you=\r\n learned ones pertaining to these incidents would be very helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vernman_1976&quot; &lt;vernman1976@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; dear sir..from what i understand from certain serious tantrics i m=\r\net....they told me that these beings cant come to you in a physical form at=\r\n all....and if you r doing these type of sadhanas without a proper guru cha=\r\nnces are that nothing would happen at all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you will be far better =\r\noff with a human companion....and gain far more doing normal worship.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; and dont trust what you come across on the net on apsaras and yakshinis=\r\n.a whole lot of male fantasies get carried away with the nonsense being por=\r\ntrayed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; with regards.....and god bless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
