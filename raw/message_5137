I would like to narrate my experience=\r\n and hopefully you can help me out regarding what happened.\n\nFor nearly 2 y=\r\nrs, I chanted Sr Rudram daily in the beginning, because I was not very flue=\r\nnt, I would pay attention to the pages I was reading. As months passed by, =\r\nI could chant without reading, I remembered it all in my head. What happene=\r\nd as a result was that Rudram chanting no longer required any focus on my p=\r\nart, I could be doing anything while chanting this and as a result, my chan=\r\nting began to lose focus. While chanting, my eyes would be paying attention=\r\n to other things...the view outside the window, the clock, ghee left in the=\r\n diya etc. My attention was everywhere else except on my chanting. I would =\r\ntry to chant with my eyes closed but because I was chanting aloud, doing th=\r\nat was proving difficult...my eyes would keep opening and rover. I also not=\r\niced that because I didn&#39;t understand what I was chanting, concentrating be=\r\ncame even more difficult.\n\nToday, I am no longer doing that chanting. I sto=\r\npped doing that several months ago and Iam afraid that the skill I had mast=\r\nered in chanting is slowly getting lost....\n\nI repeated the same with Durga=\r\n suktam. While I was new at chanting, I would focus better on my chanting. =\r\nAs I became fluent, I lost focus. In this case as well, I had no clue what =\r\nI was chanting.\n\nMy sadhana is more simple now, consisting of mental mantra=\r\n recitation but to me, it feels much more better doing that than chanting s=\r\nomething I do not understand.\n\nAfter reading your message, I am wondering w=\r\nhy the words of rishis, the Rudram or the Suktam did not translate into ene=\r\nrgy for me. Please do not misunderstand, I am not trying to question you, I=\r\n am just trying to find an answer to something that keeps troubling me.\n\nTh=\r\nanks,\nBhupendra\n\n\nSent from my iPod\n\nOn Oct 25, 2010, at 5:23 PM, Narasimha=\r\n PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I will give my 2=\r\n cents on a few points.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Sap=\r\ntashati into my mother tongue Telugu in poetic form, so that Telugu people =\r\nwho find Saptashati too complicated to read or feel uncomfortable because t=\r\nhey do not know the meaning, can read the Telugu version instead. When I fl=\r\noated the idea, Manish discouraged me. He asked me, &quot;who do you think you a=\r\nre?&quot; He said that it could be considered later, but firmly told me to drop =\r\nthe idea for then.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam=\r\n, meditation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual und=\r\nerstanding of what they mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channe=\r\nl its energy. They are storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and=\r\n sadhakas, who used them in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; An intellectual understanding ma=\r\ny help facilitate the right mood, right frame of mind and right imagery. Bu=\r\nt, even without it, a mantra that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and ris=\r\nhis holds power.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intelle=\r\nctually understand can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the w=\r\nords of a normal person that one can intellectually understand and apprecia=\r\nte. So, I suggest not worrying about whether one understands or not and rea=\r\nding Sanskrit mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may=\r\n read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball=\r\n from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of th=\r\ne ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and whe=\r\nn to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good bats=\r\nman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some bas=\r\nic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more=\r\n important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, some conceptual understa=\r\nnding is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is more im=\r\nportant.\n&gt; \n&gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all=\r\n paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we ar=\r\ne doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The divi=\r\nne acts through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives correspond=\r\ning reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the notions o=\r\nf &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Thoug=\r\nh this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be delude=\r\nd again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this understand=\r\ning fully and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellectually und=\r\nerstand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the b=\r\nack of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s =\r\nown thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana=\r\n will yield results.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; This is why I keep repeating the need =\r\nof sadhana. It is fine to read scriptures and other books. It is fine to me=\r\net spiritual people (physically or virtually, like here) and discuss good t=\r\nhings. But that will only create a theoretical understanding. For it to be =\r\ninternalized and to govern all of one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, on=\r\ne needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical u=\r\nnderstanding of what is what and what we want, is like a blind person runni=\r\nng around a mountain, instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but ha=\r\nving an excellent theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows tha=\r\nt he needs to climb the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead=\r\n of climbing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is=\r\n important in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of =\r\na continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and =\r\nwhat one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be car=\r\neful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a par=\r\nticular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and not =\r\nmany are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specific=\r\n material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints ar=\r\ne fewer and options more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that =\r\nTantrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic path is f=\r\nor self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path ma=\r\ny chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for long=\r\nevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substa=\r\nnce in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; an=\r\nd to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; My t=\r\nhumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific material result, you ne=\r\ned clear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of giving tod=\r\nay! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase of your surrend=\r\ner, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation or guidance. Just ke=\r\nep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, if y=\r\nou want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise directions and some s=\r\nupervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you can keep walking towa=\r\nrds north. Of course, having supervision helps there too, but you can do wi=\r\nthout it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prak=\r\nash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English=\r\n or any &gt;other regional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;=\r\nconstant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text i=\r\nn a language that they can fully follow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the r=\r\neason then its understandable.

Since the last 4-5 years I=\r\n have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. I=\r\nt has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However a=\r\nfter Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write up =\r\nto my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I=\r\n am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and more s=\r\nincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this part=\r\nicular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessity=\r\n of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture that ne=\r\neds to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY answ=\r\ners possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? Generally =\r\nspeaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement f=\r\nor spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question i=\r\ns about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by =\r\n*Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde mat=\r\nir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple ap=\r\nproaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple pers=\r\npectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But i=\r\nn the current context of this question I will restrict myself to only the f=\r\nive that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (A=\r\ndvaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantr=\r\na marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma =\r\nmarga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit=\r\nual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths o=\r\nf the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and tec=\r\nhniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experienti=\r\nal level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employ=\r\ned by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented=\r\n to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessar=\r\ny, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genui=\r\nne teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Di=\r\nscernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmi=\r\nnation of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhya=\r\nya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of thes=\r\ne practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for extern=\r\nal practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching=\r\n by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). H=\r\nindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting o=\r\nneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yo=\r\ngamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional accep=\r\ntance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contr=\r\nary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad G=\r\nita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay =\r\nof Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tan=\r\ntric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiat=\r\nion and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the=\r\n practicalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda thro=\r\nugh the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any l=\r\nab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should=\r\n be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at v=\r\narious levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here =\r\nis to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one p=\r\nath invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, =\r\nanother the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yag=\r\nnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with=\r\n the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra =\r\nemploys highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays =\r\ngreat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about =\r\nqualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any =\r\nsupervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like =\r\nany other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the pro=\r\ncedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment to=\r\no. However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awak=\r\nening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Ku=\r\nndalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will=\r\n refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other=\r\n needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru paramp=\r\nara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to=\r\n contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is o=\r\nne major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the =\r\nentire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three maj=\r\nor schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidya=\r\ns- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kaliku=\r\nla whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture mo=\r\nre complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. =\r\nTo those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to th=\r\ne the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook=\r\n as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at al=\r\nl) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milesto=\r\nnes in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, et=\r\nc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for=\r\n each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the =\r\npractitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The G=\r\nuru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the =\r\nroot from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs sp=\r\nread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. It is a beauti=\r\nful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can =\r\nuse is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiat=\r\nion not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity=\r\n but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at ea=\r\nch point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long series =\r\nof sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself. It=\r\n is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri S=\r\nri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken=\r\n Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated approach t=\r\nhat combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both K=\r\nalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated a=\r\npproaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi =\r\nseemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fled=\r\nged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a=\r\n text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is =\r\nrelevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the tex=\r\nt as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, th=\r\ne esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my =\r\nwrite-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri =\r\nChandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its =\r\ncentral message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text=\r\n is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanis=\r\nhadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in th=\r\nis universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the oth=\r\ner Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English=\r\n or any other regional language is because understanding the meaning and co=\r\nnstant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the text in a=\r\n language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to ex=\r\nplore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obvious sta=\r\ntus as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Srut=\r\ni just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard all t=\r\nhe applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally possible wi=\r\nth Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is a=\r\ncquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify that Ya=\r\ngnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha=\r\n in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on one mappin=\r\ng of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as som=\r\ne practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana =\r\nin accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Ta=\r\nntric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this parti=\r\ncular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation =\r\nis not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or =\r\nthe Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of re=\r\nading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required =\r\nif one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagny=\r\na. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. H=\r\nowever one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions of =\r\nboth Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts o=\r\nf the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence th=\r\ne importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vid=\r\nya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through an=\r\ny of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichar=\r\na, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa e=\r\ntc are all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, apti=\r\ntude etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different pr=\r\nactitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods=\r\n in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIK=\r\nULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the an=\r\nswer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one=\r\n last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA ar=\r\ne the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study=\r\n of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This=\r\n is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSA=\r\nNGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the al=\r\nternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It=\r\n is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress i=\r\nn spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue=\r\n of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sa=\r\nnts in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quan=\r\ntum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Rama=\r\nkrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For=\r\n those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just q=\r\nuote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householder=\r\ns nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The comp=\r\nany of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere dem=\r\nand, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If=\r\n you are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You l=\r\nead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas.=\r\n You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle =\r\ngossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of pass=\r\nion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Sat=\r\nsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I sha=\r\nll take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the righ=\r\nt path, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or =\r\nhigh souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas=\r\n are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no =\r\ngood Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real se=\r\nekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even t=\r\nhis forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate b=\r\nhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparable to th=\r\ne actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a =\r\nyoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as S=\r\nri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirta=\r\nns/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by di=\r\nscernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group su=\r\nch as this, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I may not interact r=\r\negularly or reply at least for a while. However I might participate in some=\r\n discussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few times.

I am obviously talking about &quot;Initiation&quot; and=\r\n he has really given an answer to this greatly confusing phenomina. I am re=\r\nproducing this again below. for me i am completely satisfied with simple bu=\r\nt very effective defination. i would draw attention of members to following=\r\n paragraph again:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Cha=\r\nndipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude o=\r\nf &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. B=\r\necause of this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual resul=\r\nts and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives.=\r\n I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;.=\r\n You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an =\r\ninitiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Its a time to say Happy Vija=\r\nya Dashami in true sense!

Similarly, =\r\na guru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disci=\r\nple. However, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank =\r\naccount with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard w=\r\nork. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous man=\r\ntras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate =\r\nyou (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise,=\r\n just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals =\r\nare used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (=\r\nii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the =\r\ncase of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), th=\r\nere are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in tr=\r\nouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, =\r\nthere are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilize=\r\nd the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantr=\r\nas and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever material res=\r\nults god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do=\r\n rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for oneself or others o=\r\nr society/universe in general), Nature will make arrangements for one to ge=\r\nt correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start w=\r\nith the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Cha=\r\nndipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude o=\r\nf &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. B=\r\necause of this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual resul=\r\nts and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives.=\r\n I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;.=\r\n You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an =\r\ninitiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results sl=\r\nowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but th=\r\nere may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a p=\r\nerson is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garb=\r\nage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is=\r\n gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floo=\r\nr will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and ther=\r\ne may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit st=\r\nuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of y=\r\nour karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw=\r\n them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spilla=\r\nge. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to =\r\nget out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity li=\r\nke Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the =\r\ngood fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember t=\r\nhat these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions.=\r\n Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten fruits befor=\r\ne eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable =\r\nto take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce=\r\n deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if =\r\nmade mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. I=\r\nf you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some =\r\nbad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actio=\r\nns and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hear=\r\nted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who =\r\nnever lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing dail=\r\ny homam now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the =\r\nfirst time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire sapta=\r\nshati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot and have ex=\r\nperienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and =\r\nsadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someo=\r\nne has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is looking f=\r\nor god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), t=\r\nhat person obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has=\r\n done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adh=\r\nikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what=\r\n is what, how things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what =\r\nis more important and what is less important, that is what initiation is al=\r\nl about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-1-515866392\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Namaste narasimha Rao ji&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What you have mentioned about not needing to understand S=\r\nanskrit text is interesting. I would like to narrate my experience and hope=\r\nfully you can help me out regarding what happened.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;For nearly 2 yrs, I chanted Sr Rudram daily in the beginning, because I wa=\r\ns not very fluent, I would pay attention to the pages I was reading. As mon=\r\nths passed by, I could chant without reading, I remembered it all in my hea=\r\nd. What happened as a result was that Rudram chanting no longer required an=\r\ny focus on my part, I could be doing anything while chanting this and as a =\r\nresult, my chanting began to lose focus. While chanting, my eyes would be p=\r\naying attention to other things...the view outside the window, the clock, g=\r\nhee left in the diya etc. My attention was everywhere else except on my cha=\r\nnting. I would try to chant with my eyes closed but because I was chanting =\r\naloud, doing that was proving difficult...my eyes would keep opening and ro=\r\nver. I also noticed that because I didn&#39;t understand what I was chanting, c=\r\noncentrating became even more difficult.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, I =\r\nam no longer doing that chanting. I stopped doing that several months ago a=\r\nnd Iam afraid that the skill I had mastered in chanting is slowly getting l=\r\nost....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I repeated the same with Durga suktam. Whi=\r\nle I was new at chanting, I would focus better on my chanting. As I became =\r\nfluent, I lost focus. In this case as well, I had no clue what I was chanti=\r\nng.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My sadhana is more simple now, consisting of m=\r\nental mantra recitation but to me, it feels much more better doing that tha=\r\nn chanting something I do not understand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After re=\r\nading your message, I am wondering why the words of rishis, the Rudram or t=\r\nhe Suktam did not translate into energy for me. Please do not misunderstand=\r\n, I am not trying to question you, I am just trying to find an answer to so=\r\nmething that keeps troubling me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Bhupendra&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent from my iPod&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On =\r\nOct 25, 2010, at 5:23 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@chart=\r\ner.net&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote =\r\ntype=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;=\r\ndiv id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nI w=\r\nill give my 2 cents on a few points.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nI once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu i=\r\nn poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to=\r\n read or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can read =\r\nthe Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.=\r\n He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be consider=\r\ned later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nPlease no=\r\nte that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras an=\r\nd prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. The=\r\ny are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouse=\r\ns of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the p=\r\nast.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAn intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right =\r\nmood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra=\r\n that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nI=\r\nn fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can =\r\nbe more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person=\r\n that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not w=\r\norrying about whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras c=\r\noming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman ma=\r\ny read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the bal=\r\nl from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of t=\r\nhe ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and wh=\r\nen to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good bat=\r\nsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some ba=\r\nsic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is mor=\r\ne important than bookish knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, some conceptual un=\r\nderstanding is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is m=\r\nore important.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nThe essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sa=\r\ndhanas, all paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions=\r\n that we are doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of u=\r\ns. The divine acts through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives=\r\n corresponding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes th=\r\ne notions of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot;=\r\n etc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one ma=\r\ny be deluded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this=\r\n understanding fully and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is m=\r\nine&quot; etc.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nSo, even if one practices a mantra that one does not in=\r\ntellectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of script=\r\nures is at the back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watc=\r\nhing over one&#39;s own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thought=\r\ns, one&#39;s sadhana will yield results.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nThis is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scri=\r\nptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or =\r\nvirtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a =\r\ntheoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of o=\r\nne&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nOn=\r\ne doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what a=\r\nnd what we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead =\r\nof climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical =\r\nunderstanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mounta=\r\nin, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*  =\r\n      *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nRegarding the statement that initiation is impor=\r\ntant in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a=\r\n continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude =\r\nand what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be=\r\n careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a=\r\n particular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and =\r\nnot many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for spec=\r\nific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraint=\r\ns are fewer and options more.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nSome may sub-consciously have a not=\r\nion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic =\r\npath is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedi=\r\nc path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam=\r\n for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gro=\r\nss substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Br=\r\nahman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*=\r\n        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nMy thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a=\r\n specific material result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which n=\r\not many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progres=\r\ns and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana withou=\r\nt initiation or guidance.

Since the last 4-5 years I have p=\r\nreferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. It has b=\r\neen nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However after Na=\r\nrasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write up to my i=\r\nnbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I am hap=\r\npy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and more sincere =\r\nthan a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this particular =\r\nthread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regardin=\r\ng the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big =\r\npicture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question an=\r\nd the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific =\r\none? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolut=\r\ne requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if=\r\n the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana =\r\nas enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; =\r\nthereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus aris=\r\nes the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context th=\r\nere are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question=\r\n I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussio=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic=\r\n)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c.=\r\n Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Acti=\r\nons)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but t=\r\nhe practicalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the=\r\n above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to=\r\n practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly =\r\nlook at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Adva=\r\nita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one =\r\ncan greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. Th=\r\ne direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and=\r\n Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the =\r\nVaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular s=\r\nelf-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices in=\r\nvolve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external practices.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-=\r\ncoaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attach=\r\nment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (ori=\r\nenting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schoo=\r\nls of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwar=\r\navada.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) =\r\nemphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrende=\r\nr to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action =\r\nas advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment t=\r\no the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sad=\r\nhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the nec=\r\nessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of ce=\r\nrtain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of V=\r\nak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and there=\r\nby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that exc=\r\nept Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bh=\r\nakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni=\r\n-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the=\r\n fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of aus=\r\nterity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with =\r\nthe fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra e=\r\nmploys highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays g=\r\nreat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=\r\nualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any s=\r\nupervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like a=\r\nny other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the proc=\r\nedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too=\r\n.  However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awak=\r\nening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Ku=\r\nndalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will=\r\n refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other=\r\n needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru paramp=\r\nara.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri =\r\nSri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context t=\r\noo. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha =\r\nMaha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there =\r\nare actually three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions am=\r\nong the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sad=\r\nhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just=\r\n to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) h=\r\nave taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I wi=\r\nll draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares bo=\r\nth the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sa=\r\ndhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* inv=\r\nokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantl=\r\ny invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual =\r\njourney. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a pa=\r\nrticular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages.=\r\n Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular=\r\n spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared =\r\nto an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk aris=\r\nes. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downwar=\r\nd till the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visua=\r\nlise it. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. I=\r\nt is held by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the ci=\r\nrcuit necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circ=\r\nuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tre=\r\ne of live wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent=\r\n practice all the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light=\r\n (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti=\r\n within the individual consciousness through an integrated approach that co=\r\nmbines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikul=\r\na and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated approac=\r\nhes that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemin=\r\ngly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fledged Ad=\r\nvaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text =\r\non Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is releva=\r\nnt only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the text as a=\r\n mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, the esot=\r\neric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my write-=\r\nup. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi=\r\n provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its centra=\r\nl message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is th=\r\ne Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic =\r\nfashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this uni=\r\nverse. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other Mah=\r\navakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to=\r\n read in English or any other regional language is because understanding th=\r\ne meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly rea=\r\nds the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the=\r\n writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart fro=\r\nm its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally=\r\n regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In =\r\nthat regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are eq=\r\nually possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*=\r\n. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway=\r\n identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worsh=\r\nip of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a =\r\none on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an i=\r\nntegral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approac=\r\nh, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as=\r\n per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation=\r\n as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the V=\r\nedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairag=\r\nya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred My=\r\nth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predom=\r\ninantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all o=\r\nf these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that =\r\nthe living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as =\r\npracticed originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace =\r\nthemselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those=\r\n paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the merth=\r\nods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswaraprani=\r\ndhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all eff=\r\nective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., som=\r\ne of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. O=\r\nne may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spiritual =\r\nlife. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves M=\r\nantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer to the qu=\r\nestion has to be contextualised.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fin=\r\nally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATS=\r\nANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular se=\r\nlf-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the tex=\r\nts. This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As f=\r\nor SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya i=\r\ns the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not poss=\r\nible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid pr=\r\nogress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state b=\r\ny virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhu=\r\ns and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  =\r\nmade a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsan=\r\ngha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of =\r\nSatsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Q=\r\nUOTE  // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no g=\r\nood Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of=\r\n supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at o=\r\nnce. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you w=\r\nill find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, you=\r\nr mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for hig=\r\nher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly ta=\r\nlks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fame.=\r\n And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a des=\r\nerving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet =\r\nof blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and elevate =\r\nyou to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get =\r\nhold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers a=\r\nre few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also =\r\nbring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot;  //UNQUO=\r\nTE&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this for=\r\num is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana,=\r\n this group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actua=\r\nl company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-ve=\r\ndantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Rama=\r\nkrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chan=\r\nts lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by discernme=\r\nnt of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as t=\r\nhis, one makes progress truly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may=\r\n not interact regularly or reply at least for a while.

Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some o=\r\nf it to a disciple. However, one without a rich father is still better off =\r\nopening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slowly with o=\r\nne&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana =\r\nwith famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a gu=\r\nru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initia=\r\nted.
