Though what he says below is wise, it is not \ncomplete.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhile selfishness is bad and selflessness is good, things are not so \nsimple in real life. Suppose I have 1,000 dollars. Suppose a library \nwants that money to buy some books. Suppose a temple wants that money to \nbuy some materials for pooja. Suppose a relative wants it to buy \nsomething. Suppose an orphanage wants it to sustain their activities? \nSuppose I can buy for myself a computer as my old computer is on the \nverge of breaking down. What is the right action?\n\nDharma or the righteous course is personal and changes from person to \nperson. Taking care of the physical body that we occupy (and use for a \nfew decades) and its needs, is also our dharma. Helping family, \nrelatives and friends is also our dharma. Helping other people that we \ncome across is also our dharma. Helping the society at large is also our \ndharma. Helping the nation we live in is also our dharma. Helping the \nworld and the universe is also our dharma. Sometimes (many times), \ndharma towards different entities may clash. In such an event, finding \nout which is the higher dharma is not trivial.\n\nIn some cases, pursuing a lower dharma and ignoring a higher dharma \n(e.g. taking care of one&#39;s own physical well-being instead of serving \nsome people) may be better and may enable a much higher dharma later on \n(e.g. being able later to serve many many more people).\n\nThe purer one is, the clearer is one&#39;s vision of one&#39;s dharma. An impure \nperson sees the world through the color of one&#39;s mental conditioning and \nsees one&#39;s dharma incorrectly. As one disahcarges more and more of one&#39;s \ndharma, as one increases surrender to god and detachment to the results \nof actions, as one&#39;s ego effaces more and more, one becomes purer and \nthe conditioning reduces. One&#39;s dharma becomes clearer.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; \n&lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As soon as selfish desires arise, as soon as some selfish pursuit is \n&gt; followed, immediately the whole man, the real man, is gone: he is like \n&gt; a brute, he is a slave, he forgets his fellow men. No more does he \n&gt; say, &#39;You first and I afterwards&#39;, but it is &#39;I first and let every \n&gt; one else look out for himself&#39;.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
