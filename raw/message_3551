He who dresses\nsmartly will naturally sing love songs, play cards and carry a cane, and\nsuch things will appeal to him. If you have a pencil in your hand, you will\nunconsciously scribble on anything; such is the power of the pencil. Money\nhas great power. When a man becomes wealthy his nature is entirely changed. He\nis a different being. A poor Brahmin, for instance, used to come here. He\nwas very humble. He lived on the other side of the Ganges. One day as I was\nlanding from a boat, I saw him sitting at the riverside. Seeing me, he\nshouted in a disrespectful tone, &quot;Hello! is it you, my good fellow?&quot;\nImmediately I understood by his manner that he had got hold of some money,\notherwise he would not dare to address me thus.\n\nA toad had a Rupee in its hole. An elephant was coming that way and passed\nover the hole. The toad was very angry; it came out and was about to kick\nthe elephant, saying: &quot;How darest thou pass over me?&quot; Such is the power of\nwealth! It makes one so egotistic. This sense of &quot;I,&quot; however, vanishes at\nthe approach of Divine wisdom, which leads to super-consciousness (Samadhi)\nand eventually to God-consciousness. But it is very difficult to acquire\nthis Divine wisdom. [p. 53]\n\nYou may cut the branches of a fig-tree to-day, but to-morrow you will see\nthat new twigs are sprouting. If this sense of &quot;I&quot; will not leave, then let\nit stay as the servant of God. &quot;O God! Thou art my Lord, I am Thy servant!&quot;\nThink in this way: &quot;I am His servant, I am His Bhakta, devotee.&quot; There is no\nharm in this kind of &quot;I.&quot; Sweet things cause dyspepsia and acidity, but\ncrystallized sugar-candy is harmless. The path of wisdom is very difficult.\nIt cannot be followed so long as the sense of &quot;I&quot; is connected with the\nbody. In this age the consciousness of the body and the sense of &quot;I&quot; cannot\nbe overcome easily. [p. 56]\n\nBut in the path of devotion, through prayer and the repetition of His Holy\nName with extreme longing, God can be reached without fail. Devotee:\nBhagavan, dost Thou teach us to renounce the worldly &quot;I&quot; and not the sense\nof the servant &quot;I&quot;? Ramakrishna: Yes, the servant &quot;I&quot; or &quot;I am the servant\nof God,&quot; &quot;I am His devotee,&quot; this egoism is not bad but on the contrary it\nhelps us to realize God. Devotee: Bhagavan, does he who has the sense of the\nservant &quot;I&quot; possess passion and anger? Ramakrishna: If this attitude of a\nservant be genuine and perfect, then passion and anger will drop off leaving\nonly a scar in the mind. This &quot;I&quot; of a Bhakta or devotee does no harm to any\nliving creature. It is like a sword which, after touching the Philosopher&#39;s\nStone, is turned to gold. The sword retains the same form but it cannot cut\nor injure anyone. The dry leaves of the cocoanut-tree drop off in the wind,\nleaving a mark on the trunk; that mark proves that there was a leaf there at\none time. Similarly, the scar of the sense of &quot;I&quot; remains in the mind of one\nwho has realized God, but his whole nature is transformed into that of an\ninnocent child. [p. 57]\n\nThe mind may be compared to a needle. If a needle be covered with thick mud,\nit is not attracted by the magnet; but when the mud is washed off, the\nmagnet attracts it. [Power of repentance] Similarly, when the mind is\ncovered with the mud of worldliness, it does not feel the attraction of the\nLord; but whosoever repents, saying: &quot;O Lord, I shall never again commit\nsuch an act,&quot; and sheds tears of true repentance, washes off all impurities\nand the magnet of the Lord then attracts the needle of the mind. Instantly\nsuper-consciousness comes and is followed by God-vision.[p. 60]\n\nSource: THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--000e0cd182d49553d9047de51df6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nEach attribute limits the soul and modifies its nature.
