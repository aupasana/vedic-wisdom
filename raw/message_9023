The polite term for this trick is =E2=80=9Cemerg=\r\nence.=E2=80=9D At a\ncertain stage of biological complexity, evolutionary bi=\r\nologists claim,\nconsciousness pops out of the brain like a rabbit from a ma=\r\ngician=E2=80=99s hat.\nYet this claim rests on no direct evidence whatsoever=\r\n. As Rutgers\nUniversity philosopher Jerry A. Fodo flatly states, =E2=80=9CN=\r\nobody has the\nslightest idea how anything material could be conscious. So m=\r\nuch for our\nphilosophy of consciousness.=E2=80=9D\n\nIn spite of the complete=\r\n absence of evidence, the belief that the brain\nproduces consciousness endu=\r\nres and has ossified into dogma. Many scientists\nrealize the limitations of=\r\n this belief. One way of getting around the lack\nof evidence is simply to d=\r\neclare that what we call consciousness is the\nbrain itself. That way, nothi=\r\nng is produced, and the magic of =E2=80=9Cemergence=E2=80=9D\nis avoided. As=\r\n astronomer Carl Sagan expressed his position, =E2=80=9CMy\nfundamental prem=\r\nise about the brain is that its workings =E2=80=93 what we\nsometimes call m=\r\nind =E2=80=93 are a consequence of anatomy and physiology, and\nnothing more=\r\n.=E2=80=9D Nobelist Francis Crick agreed, saying =E2=80=9C[A] person=E2=80=\r\n=99s mental\nactivities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells, gli=\r\nal cells,\nand the atoms, ions, and molecules that make up and influence the=\r\nm.=E2=80=9D\n\nThis =E2=80=9Cidentity theory=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 mind equals b=\r\nrain =E2=80=93 has led legions of scientists\nand philosophers to regard con=\r\nsciousness as an unnecessary, superfluous\nconcept. Some go out of their way=\r\n to deny the existence of consciousness\naltogether, almost as if they bear =\r\na grudge against it. Tufts University\ncognitive scientist Daniel Dennett sa=\r\nys, =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re all zombies. Nobody is\nconscious.=E2=80=9D Denne=\r\ntt includes himself in this extraordinary claim, and he\nseems proud of it.\n=\r\n\nConsciousness can operate beyond the brain, body, and the present, as\nhund=\r\nreds of experiments and millions of testimonials affirm. Consciousness\ncann=\r\not, therefore, be identical with the brain.\n\nOthers suggest that there are =\r\nno mental states at all, such as love,\ncourage, or patriotism, but only ele=\r\nctrochemical brain fluxes that should\nnot be described with such inflated l=\r\nanguage. They dismiss thoughts and\nbeliefs for the same reasons. This led N=\r\nobel neurophysiologist Sir John\nEccles to remark that =E2=80=9Cprofessional=\r\n philosophers and psychologists think up\nthe notion that there are no thoug=\r\nhts, come to believe that there are no\nbeliefs, and feel strongly that ther=\r\ne are no feelings.=E2=80=9D Eccles was\nemphasizing the absurdities that hav=\r\ne crept into the debates about\nconsciousness. They are not hard to spot. So=\r\nme of the oddest experiences I\nrecall are attending conferences where one s=\r\npeaker after another employs\nhis consciousness to denounce the existence of=\r\n consciousness, ignoring the\nfact that he consciously chose to register for=\r\n the meeting, make travel\nplans, prepare his talks, and so on.\n\nMany scient=\r\nists concede that there are huge gaps in their knowledge of how\nthe brain m=\r\nakes consciousness, but they are certain they will be filled in\nas science =\r\nprogresses. Eccles and philosopher of science Karl Popper\nbranded this atti=\r\ntude =E2=80=9Cpromissory materialism.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C[P]romissary materi=\r\nalism\n[is] a superstition without a rational foundation,=E2=80=9D Eccles sa=\r\nys. =E2=80=9C[It] is\nsimply a religious belief held by dogmatic materialist=\r\ns . . .who confuse\ntheir religion with their science. It has all the featur=\r\nes of a messianic\nprophecy.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe arguments about the origins and n=\r\nature of consciousness are central to\npremonitions. For if the promissory m=\r\naterialists are correct =E2=80=93 if\nconsciousness is indeed identical with=\r\n the brain =E2=80=93 the curtain closes on\npremonitions. The reason is that=\r\n the brain is a local phenomenon =E2=80=93 i.e., it\nis localized to the bra=\r\nin and body, and to the present. This prohibits\npremonitions in principle, =\r\nbecause accordingly the brain cannot operate\noutside the body and the here-=\r\nand-now. But consciousness can operate beyond\nthe brain, body, and the pres=\r\nent, as hundreds of experiments and millions\nof testimonials affirm. Consci=\r\nousness cannot, therefore, be identical with\nthe brain.\n\nIn science, we hav=\r\ne largely ignored how consciousness manifests in our\nexistence. We=E2=80=99=\r\nve done this by assuming that the brain produces\nconsciousness, although ho=\r\nw it might do so has never been explained and can\nhardly be imagined.\n\nThes=\r\ne assertions are not hyperbolic, but conservative. They are consistent\nwith=\r\n the entire span of human history, throughout which all cultures of\nwhich w=\r\ne have record believed that human perception extends beyond the\nreach of th=\r\ne senses. This belief might be dismissed as superstition but for\nthe fact t=\r\nhat modern research has established its validity beyond\nreasonable doubt to=\r\n anyone whose reasoning has not clotted into hardened\nskepticism. To reiter=\r\nate a single example =E2=80=93 the evidence supporting\nforeknowledge =E2=80=\r\n=93 psi researchers Charles Honorton and Diane Ferrari examined\n309 precogn=\r\nition experiments carried out by sixty-two investigators\ninvolving 50,000 p=\r\narticipants in more than two million trials. Thirty\npercent of these studie=\r\ns were significant in showing that people can\ndescribe future events, when =\r\nonly five percent would be expected to\ndemonstrate such results by chance. =\r\nThe odds that these results were not\ndue to chance was greater than 10 to t=\r\nhe twentieth power to one.\n\nOne of the first modern thinkers to endorse an =\r\noutside-the-brain view of\nconsciousness was William James, who is considere=\r\nd the father of American\npsychology. In his 1898 Ingersoll Lecture at Harva=\r\nrd University, James took\na courageous stand against what he called =E2=80=\r\n=9Cthe fangs of cerebralism and the\nidea that consciousness is produced by =\r\nthe brain. He acknowledged that\narrested brain development in childhood can=\r\n lead to mental retardation,\nthat strokes or blows to the head can abolish =\r\nmemory or consciousness, and\nthat certain chemicals can change the quality =\r\nof thought. But to consider\nthis as proof that the brain actually makes con=\r\nsciousness, James said, is\nirrational.\n\n[image: Why Consciousness is Not th=\r\ne Brain - The Science of Premonitions -\nLarry Dossey]\n\nWhy irrational? Cons=\r\nider a radio, an invention that was introduced during\nJames=E2=80=99s lifet=\r\nime, and which he used to illustrate the mind-brain\nrelationship. If one ba=\r\nngs a radio with a hammer, it ceases to function.\nBut that does not mean th=\r\nat the origin of the sounds was the radio itself;\nthe sound originated from=\r\n outside it in the form of an electromagnetic\nsignal. The radio received, m=\r\nodified, and amplified the external signal\ninto something recognizable as s=\r\nound. Just so, the brain can be damaged in\nvarious ways that distort the qu=\r\nality of consciousness =E2=80=93 trauma, stroke,\nnutritional deficiencies, =\r\ndementia, etc. But this does not necessarily mean\nthe brain =E2=80=9Cmade=\r\n=E2=80=9D the consciousness that is now disturbed, or that\nconsciousness is=\r\n identical to the brain.\n\nBritish philosopher Chris Carter endorses this an=\r\nalogy. Equating mind and\nbrain is irrational, he says as listening to music=\r\n on a radio, smashing the\nradio=E2=80=99s receiver, and thereby concluding =\r\nthat the radio was producing the\nmusic.\n\nTo update the analogy, consider a =\r\ntelevision set. We can damage a\ntelevision set so severely that we lose the=\r\n image on the screen, but this\ndoesn=E2=80=99t prove that the TV actually p=\r\nroduced the image. We know that David\nLetterman does not live behind the TV=\r\n screen on which he appears; yet the\ncontention that brain equals conscious=\r\nness is as absurd as if he did.\n\nMy conclusion is that consciousness is not=\r\n a thing or substance, but is a\nnonlocal phenomenon. Nonlocal is merely a f=\r\nancy word for infinite. If\nsomething is nonlocal, it is not localized to sp=\r\necific points in space,\nsuch as brains or bodies, or to specific points in =\r\ntime, such as the\npresent.\n\nThe radio and TV analogies can be misleading, h=\r\nowever, because\nconsciousness does not behave like an electromagnetic signa=\r\nl.\nElectromagnetic (EM) signals display certain characteristics. The farthe=\r\nr\naway they get from their source, the weaker they become. Not so with\ncons=\r\nciousness; its effects do not attenuate with increasing distance. For\nexamp=\r\nle, in the hundreds of healing experiments that have been done in both\nhuma=\r\nns and animals, healing intentions work equally well from the other\nside of=\r\n the earth as at the bedside of the sick individual. Moreover, EM\nsignals c=\r\nan be blocked partially or completely, but the effects of\nconscious intenti=\r\non cannot be blocked by any known substance. For instance,\nsea water is kno=\r\nwn to block EM signals completely at certain depths, yet\nexperiments in rem=\r\note viewing have been successfully carried out beyond\nsuch depths, demonstr=\r\nating that the long-distance communication between the\ninvolved individuals=\r\n cannot depend on EM-type signals. In addition, EM\nsignals require travel t=\r\nime from their source to a receiver, yet thoughts\ncan be perceived simultan=\r\neously between individuals across global\ndistances. Thoughts can be displac=\r\ned in time, operating into both past and\nfuture. In precognitive remoteview=\r\ning experiments =E2=80=93 for example, the\nhundreds of such experiments by =\r\nthe PEAR Lab at Princeton University =E2=80=93 the\nreceiver gets a future t=\r\nhought before it is ever sent. Furthermore,\nconsciousness can operate into =\r\nthe past, as in the experiments involving\nretroactive intentions. Electroma=\r\ngnetic signals are not capable of these\nfeats. From these differences, we c=\r\nan conclude that consciousness is not an\nelectric signal.\n\nThen what is it?=\r\n My conclusion is that consciousness is not a thing or\nsubstance, but is a =\r\n*nonlocal* phenomenon.*Nonlocal* is merely a fancy word\nfor *infinite*. If =\r\nsomething is nonlocal, it is not localized to specific\npoints in space, suc=\r\nh as brains or bodies, or to specific points in time,\nsuch as the present. =\r\nNonlocal events are *immediate*; they require no\ntravel time. They are unme=\r\ndiated; they require no energetic signal to\n=E2=80=9Ccarry=E2=80=9D them. T=\r\nhey are*unmitigated*; they do not become weaker with\nincreasing distance. N=\r\nonlocal phenomena are *omnipresent*, everywhere at\nonce. This means there i=\r\ns no necessity for them to go anywhere; they are\nalready there. They are in=\r\nfinite in time as well, present at all moments,\npast present and future, me=\r\naning they are *eternal*.\n\nResearcher Dean Radin, whose presentiment experi=\r\nments provide profound\nevidence for future knowing, believes that the nonlo=\r\ncal events in the\nsubatomic, quantum domain underlie the nonlocal events we=\r\n experience at the\nhuman level. He invokes the concept of entanglement as a=\r\n bridging\nhypothesis uniting the small- and large-scale happenings. Quantum=\r\n\nentanglement and quantum nonlocality are indeed potent possibilities that\n=\r\nmay eventually explain our nonlocal experiences, but only further research\n=\r\nwill tell. Meanwhile, there is a gathering tide of opinion favoring these\na=\r\npproaches. As physicist Chris Clarke, of the University of Southampton,\nsay=\r\ns, =E2=80=9COn one hand, Mind is inherently non-local. On the other, the wo=\r\nrld\nis governed by a quantum physics that is inherently non-local. This is =\r\nno\naccident, but a precise correspondence ...[Mind and the world are] aspec=\r\nts\nof the same thing...The way ahead, I believe, has to place mind first as=\r\n\nthe key aspect of the universe...We have to start exploring how we can tal=\r\nk\nabout mind in terms of a quantum picture...Only then will we be able to\nm=\r\nake a genuine bridge between physics and physiology.=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen scienti=\r\nsts muster the courage to face this evidence unflinchingly, the\ngreatest su=\r\nperstition of our age =E2=80=93 the notion that the brain generates\nconscio=\r\nusness or is identical with it =E2=80=93 will topple. In its place will\nari=\r\nse a nonlocal picture of the mind.\n\nWhatever their explanation proves to be=\r\n, the experiments documenting\npremonitions are real. They must be reckoned =\r\nwith. And when scientists\nmuster the courage to face this evidence unflinch=\r\ningly, the greatest\nsuperstition of our age =E2=80=93 the notion that the b=\r\nrain generates consciousness\nor is identical with it =E2=80=93 will topple.=\r\n In its place will arise a nonlocal\npicture of the mind. This view will aff=\r\nirm that consciousness is\nfundamental, omnipresent and eternal =E2=80=93 a =\r\nmodel that is as cordial to\npremonitions as the materialistic, brain-based =\r\nview is hostile.\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n\r\n--f46d04071533e9423a04d655b97e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.superconsciousness.com/topics/science/why-consciousne=\r\nss-not-brain&quot;&gt;http://www.superconsciousness.com/topics/science/why-consciou=\r\nsness-not-brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:1em 0px;font-size=\r\n:12px;font-family:tahoma,verdana,arial,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb=\r\n(1,1,1);line-height:21px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;\n=E2=80=9CWe do=\r\nn=E2=80=99t know who first discovered water, but we can be sure that it was=\r\nn=E2=80=99t a fish,=E2=80=9D the old saw reminds us.

They are not hard to spot.

Eccles and philosopher of science Karl Popper branded this attitude=\r\n =E2=80=9Cpromissory materialism.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C[P]romissary materialis=\r\nm [is] a superstition without a rational foundation,=E2=80=9D Eccles says. =\r\n=E2=80=9C[It] is simply a religious belief held by dogmatic materialists . =\r\n. .who confuse their religion with their science.

For=\r\n if the promissory materialists are correct =E2=80=93 if consciousness is i=\r\nndeed identical with the brain =E2=80=93 the curtain closes on premonitions=\r\n. The reason is that the brain is a local phenomenon =E2=80=93 i.e., it is =\r\nlocalized to the brain and body, and to the present. This prohibits premoni=\r\ntions in principle, because accordingly the brain cannot operate outside th=\r\ne body and the here-and-now. But consciousness can operate beyond the brain=\r\n, body, and the present, as hundreds of experiments and millions of testimo=\r\nnials affirm. Consciousness cannot, therefore, be identical with the brain.=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;pullquote&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:tahoma,ve=\r\nrdana,arial,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(1,1,1);line-height:21px;cl=\r\near:both;border-bottom-width:5px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-co=\r\nlor:rgb(236,235,235);border-top-width:5px;border-top-style:solid;border-top=\r\n-color:rgb(236,235,235);background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin:12px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:18px;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sa=\r\nns-serif;color:rgb(159,23,29);line-height:24px&quot;&gt;In science, we have largely=\r\n ignored how consciousness manifests in our existence.

In his 1898 Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard University, James took a co=\r\nurageous stand against what he called =E2=80=9Cthe fangs of cerebralism and=\r\n the idea that consciousness is produced by the brain. He acknowledged that=\r\n arrested brain development in childhood can lead to mental retardation, th=\r\nat strokes or blows to the head can abolish memory or consciousness, and th=\r\nat certain chemicals can change the quality of thought.

Consider a radio, an i=\r\nnvention that was introduced during James=E2=80=99s lifetime, and which he =\r\nused to illustrate the mind-brain relationship. If one bangs a radio with a=\r\n hammer, it ceases to function. But that does not mean that the origin of t=\r\nhe sounds was the radio itself; the sound originated from outside it in the=\r\n form of an electromagnetic signal. The radio received, modified, and ampli=\r\nfied the external signal into something recognizable as sound. Just so, the=\r\n brain can be damaged in various ways that distort the quality of conscious=\r\nness =E2=80=93 trauma, stroke, nutritional deficiencies, dementia, etc. But=\r\n this does not necessarily mean the brain =E2=80=9Cmade=E2=80=9D the consci=\r\nousness that is now disturbed, or that consciousness is identical to the br=\r\nain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:1em 0px;font-size:12px;font-family:tahoma,verda=\r\nna,arial,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(1,1,1);line-height:21px;backg=\r\nround-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;British philosopher Chris Carter endorses thi=\r\ns analogy.

Nonlocal is merely a f=\r\nancy word for infinite. If something is nonlocal, it is not localized to sp=\r\necific points in space, such as brains or bodies, or to specific points in =\r\ntime, such as the present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:1em 0px;font-size:1=\r\n2px;font-family:tahoma,verdana,arial,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(1=\r\n,1,1);line-height:21px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;The radio and TV =\r\nanalogies can be misleading, however, because consciousness does not behave=\r\n like an electromagnetic signal. Electromagnetic (EM) signals display certa=\r\nin characteristics. The farther away they get from their source, the weaker=\r\n they become. Not so with consciousness; its effects do not attenuate with =\r\nincreasing distance. For example, in the hundreds of healing experiments th=\r\nat have been done in both humans and animals, healing intentions work equal=\r\nly well from the other side of the earth as at the bedside of the sick indi=\r\nvidual. Moreover, EM signals can be blocked partially or completely, but th=\r\ne effects of conscious intention cannot be blocked by any known substance. =\r\nFor instance, sea water is known to block EM signals completely at certain =\r\ndepths, yet experiments in remote viewing have been successfully carried ou=\r\nt beyond such depths, demonstrating that the long-distance communication be=\r\ntween the involved individuals cannot depend on EM-type signals. In additio=\r\nn, EM signals require travel time from their source to a receiver, yet thou=\r\nghts can be perceived simultaneously between individuals across global dist=\r\nances. Thoughts can be displaced in time, operating into both past and futu=\r\nre. In precognitive remoteviewing experiments =E2=80=93 for example, the hu=\r\nndreds of such experiments by the PEAR Lab at Princeton University =E2=80=\r\n=93 the receiver gets a future thought before it is ever sent. Furthermore,=\r\n consciousness can operate into the past, as in the experiments involving r=\r\netroactive intentions. Electromagnetic signals are not capable of these fea=\r\nts. From these differences, we can conclude that consciousness is not an el=\r\nectric signal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:1em 0px;font-size:12px;font-family:ta=\r\nhoma,verdana,arial,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(1,1,1);line-height:=\r\n21px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;Then what is it?

This means there is no necessity for them to go an=\r\nywhere; they are already there. They are infinite in time as well, present =\r\nat all moments, past present and future, meaning they are=C2=A0&lt;i&gt;eternal&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:1em 0px;font-size:12px;font-family:tahoma,verdan=\r\na,arial,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:rgb(1,1,1);line-height:21px;backgr=\r\nound-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;Researcher Dean Radin, whose presentiment expe=\r\nriments provide profound evidence for future knowing, believes that the non=\r\nlocal events in the subatomic, quantum domain underlie the nonlocal events =\r\nwe experience at the human level.
