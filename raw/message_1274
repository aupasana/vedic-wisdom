Someone sent me a few snippets from an \ninterview posted on her website. Please see below.\n\nIt is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It \nis interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and \nshow what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This \nis similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to \nhim during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n\nShe told him that many people are and will be born who will perform a short \nfire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the \nworld and also make quick spiritual progress individually in that process. \nShree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar \nlines.\n\nMy guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \nshould be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a \nday. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous places and \ncan be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no \nneed to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum \nofferings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a \nfew such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of \nevents that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n\nThough not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for \n3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \nIt is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings \ndeities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine \npresence these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure \nsouls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which \nMother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was \ntaken on Ramakrishna&#39;s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within \na few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. \nAll of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this significance when \nwe decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \nmention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are \nsimilar to the words of Mother.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt;\n&gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; pasted for your benefit), from an interview found here\n&gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonomy_menu/54/86\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go now for\n&gt; our country, and all other country, you have to go do fire ceremonies\n&gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and at that time the whole\n&gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American descent),\n&gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her and all that;\n&gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at best,\n&gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he studied\n&gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi and\n&gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of worship\n&gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities in the process.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremony\n&gt; and worship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from the\n&gt; humble temple grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n\n\n"}}
