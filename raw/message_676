One of them from the Shiva =\r\nMaha Puran states that Bhairava was created from the third eye of Shiva to =\r\ncut off one of the heads of Brahma. Thus Bhairava became the first person t=\r\no commit the sin of Brahmahatya. Later he had to take a human skull as a be=\r\ngging bowl and roamaround the earth untill finally when he reached Kasi, th=\r\ne skull fell from his hand and Lord Bhairava was liberated from the sin of =\r\nbrahmahatya. Thus he became the protector of the lord city of Kasi. It is b=\r\nelieved, anyone who goes to Kasi to visit Kasi Vishwanath, should also pay =\r\nhis/her respect to KalBhairav.\n=C2=A0\nAnother story, the 51 shakti peethas,=\r\n where the body of Sati had fallen are guarded by Shiva in his Bhairava roo=\r\npa. \n=C2=A0\nBhairav is often refered to as the deity of the Samshan (Shiva =\r\nin his sashan roopa) as well as Kshetrapala. Or protector of the field &quot;ksh=\r\netra&quot;. That is why Vatuka Bhairava (Vatuka meaning small child) is often in=\r\nvoked for protection during many rituals in the samshan. \nOn the esoteric l=\r\nevel, the kshetra is the field, the body. That is where Durga/Kali resides =\r\nin the form of the kundalini. And Shiva as Bhairava acts as the protector o=\r\nf the fortress of the Goddess. Hence, in some tantrik traditions, Bhairava =\r\nis also refered to as a son of Kali. Or in other words, one who has been in=\r\ntoxicated into God conscinousness by the Kundalini energy may act and behav=\r\ne like Bhairava in appearence (nothing material will appeal to him anymore)=\r\n. Therefore they say, one who can get the real=C2=A0grace of the divine mot=\r\nher is not a sadhak ( a sadhak gets maybe one or two aspects of the Mother =\r\ndepending on the sadhana), but a=C2=A0son or=C2=A0daughter of the Mother. =\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIn Kashmiri traditions, Bhairav holds a very important place.=\r\n He is considered to be the all in all deity who creates, maintains and the=\r\nn destroyes. He is the pure conscinousness where all duality is broken down=\r\n and hence is so fierce for ordinay mortals like us who are so accustomed t=\r\no existence within=C2=A0duality. The Rudrayamala tantra=C2=A0contains some=\r\n=C2=A0very strong descriptions of Lord Bhairava, including his various roop=\r\ns, his shaktis. There is a beautiful hymn of Kal Bhairava as composd by Adi=\r\n Shankarachrya. \n=C2=A0\nAll that I mentioned above is what I have understoo=\r\nd from a=C2=A0theoritcal point of view regarding Lord Bhairava.

Before that day, I had never eve=\r\nn heard of the name Bhairava. He had told me one more thing, the key to doi=\r\nng any genuine sadhana of Bhairava entails facing and eventually losing onc=\r\ne fears. \n\nOften people have strong misconceptions about Lord Bhairava cons=\r\nidering Him to be=C2=A0one=C2=A0associated with black magik or such.

That fire can carry va=\r\nrious \n&gt; auspicious substances to various deities, but does NOT like to car=\r\nry stuff \n&gt; like alcohol and meat, even if a deity is willing to receive th=\r\ne offering.. \n&gt; If you want to offer alcohol to a deity such as Bhairava, c=\r\nall the deity in \n&gt; an idol or a kalasha (pot) or in an animal and then mak=\r\ne the offering of \n&gt; alcohol. But do not use homam fire to make the offerin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha =\r\n(carrier \n&gt; of impurities) can be used to carry anything, without restricti=\r\nons. However, \n&gt; this fire is not used in homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few deities such as=\r\n Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be worshipped \n&gt; on a funeral pyr=\r\ne with any materials. However, such rituals are not \n&gt; appropriate for 99.9=\r\n9999999% people. Those are only for people who already \n&gt; have a very high =\r\nlevel of detachment and a very low level of distinction \n&gt; between the pola=\r\nrities of duality, i.e. people who have a very low level of \n&gt; mental disti=\r\nnction between things normally considered highly pure and things \n&gt; normall=\r\ny considered highly impure and see all as One. As a result of their \n&gt; wors=\r\nhip on funeral pyre, they may get results that are normally considered \n&gt; g=\r\nood or results that are normally considered terrible, but again their \n&gt; me=\r\nntal distinction between good and bad results is very low and they accept \n=\r\n&gt; all results with an equal vision. Rituals practiced by such aghoris are \n=\r\n&gt; aimed at honing their detachment and non-distinction to further perfectio=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such aghora practices are not to be done out of &quot;fascination&quot; or be=\r\ncause \n&gt; they seem or sound &quot;cool&quot;. That is a formula for failure and disas=\r\nter. For \n&gt; the majority of us who are still deeply affected by the polarit=\r\nies of \n&gt; duality and cannot see all things equally, worship of any deity i=\r\nn funeral \n&gt; pyre is a strict no-no. Stick to regular homam and maintain ba=\r\nsic purity, no \n&gt; matter which deity you worship in the fire. In that case,=\r\n throwing chillies, \n&gt; meat and alcohol in fire is a strict no-no. Unfortun=\r\nately, some people do \n&gt; not realize it and throw these things in their hom=\r\nam fire. This is a \n&gt; terrible thing to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; People in this age foolish=\r\nly mix up principles of duality and non-duality.. \n&gt; Principles of non-dual=\r\nity like &quot;all is god&quot; are applicable only if you can \n&gt; see god in pleasure=\r\n and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and \n&gt; pain are two dis=\r\ntinct feelings for you and you prefer one to the other, then \n&gt; you are imm=\r\nersed in duality and follow the principles of duality without \n&gt; mixing up =\r\nnon-dual principles and pretending &quot;all is god&quot;. All is NOT god \n&gt; for you =\r\nthen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Offering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can bring terrible=\r\n results to \n&gt; one. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience =\r\nthe results \n&gt; immediately, but most people do not experience right away. A=\r\ns a result, they \n&gt; do not realize what a terrible thing they are doing. My=\r\n humble request to \n&gt; everybody who performs homam is to stay away from usi=\r\nng such taamasik \n&gt; materials.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicast=\r\nro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nat=\r\nh.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; rajarshi14@yahoo. co=\r\n.in&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 17, 20=\r\n08 2:38 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n was seeing a homa being done by a person where alcohol was being\n&gt; &gt; offer=\r\ned in the fire.

But do not use homam fire to make the offering.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ano=\r\nther type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha (carrier &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; of impurities) can be used to carry anything, without restrictions. =\r\nHowever, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this fire is not used in homam..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A few d=\r\neities such as Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be worshipped &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; on a funeral pyre with any materials. However, such rituals are not &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; appropriate for 99.99999999% people. Those are only for people who al=\r\nready &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have a very high level of detachment and a very low level of=\r\n distinction &lt;BR&gt;&gt; between the\n polarities of duality, i.e. people who h=\r\nave a very low level of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental distinction between things normally=\r\n considered highly pure and things &lt;BR&gt;&gt; normally considered highly impu=\r\nre and see all as One. As a result of their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; worship on funeral pyr=\r\ne, they may get results that are normally considered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; good or resul=\r\nts that are normally considered terrible, but again their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental d=\r\nistinction between good and bad results is very low and they accept &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; all results with an equal vision.. Rituals practiced by such aghoris are =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; aimed at honing their detachment and non-distinction to further pe=\r\nrfection.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Such aghora practices are not to be done out of =\r\n&quot;fascination&quot; or because &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they seem or sound &quot;cool&quot;. That is a form=\r\nula for failure and disaster. For &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the majority of us who are still=\r\n deeply affected by the polarities of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; duality and cannot see all t=\r\nhings equally, worship of\n any deity in funeral &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pyre is a strict n=\r\no-no. Stick to regular homam and maintain basic purity, no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; matter =\r\nwhich deity you worship in the fire. In that case, throwing chillies, &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; meat and alcohol in fire is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some people =\r\ndo &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not realize it and throw these things in their homam fire. This=\r\n is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; terrible thing to do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; People in this age fo=\r\nolishly mix up principles of duality and non-duality. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Principles o=\r\nf non-duality like &quot;all is god&quot; are applicable only if you can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; see=\r\n god in pleasure and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; pain are two distinct feelings for you and you prefer one to the othe=\r\nr, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you are immersed in duality and follow the principles of d=\r\nuality without &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mixing up non-dual principles and pretending &quot;all i=\r\ns god&quot;. All is NOT god &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for you then.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Offering alc=\r\nohol, meat,\n chillies etc in homam can bring terrible results to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; o=\r\nne. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience the results &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; immediately, but most people do not experience right away. As a result=\r\n, they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; do not realize what a terrible thing they are doing. My hum=\r\nble request to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; everybody who performs homam is to stay away from u=\r\nsing such taamasik &lt;BR&gt;&gt; materials.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wi=\r\nsdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. n=\r\net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan\n nath.org&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; ra=\r\njarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, November 17, 2008 2:38 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Homa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; I was seeing a homa being done by a person where alcohol was being&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; offered in the fire.
