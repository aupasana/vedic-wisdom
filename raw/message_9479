It&#39;s a feeling that mos=\r\nt seekers go through time and again....&quot;dark night of the soul&quot; as some say=\r\n. Not an easy place to be.\n=C2=A0\nPlease go through this longish article:\nh=\r\nttps://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/howtospeakforindiantradi=\r\ntions\n\nA similar condition is expressed in the above cited article:\n&quot;Much l=\r\nike the medieval monk, this middle-aged person too experiences a shattering=\r\n of his sense of agency, but here all further similarities cease. The reaso=\r\nn lies in how this \nshattering is further experienced and what it consists =\r\nof. To the \nmiddle-aged man, this experience comes as a =E2=80=98revelation=\r\n=E2=80=99: it is as \nthough a cloak is lifted from his eyes and he is looki=\r\nng at the world \nfor the first time. He realises that he was never an agent=\r\n, even though \nhe always thought he was one. His breakdown provides him wit=\r\nh this \nknowledge, and he recognises it as such because of his tradition. H=\r\ne is \nnow enlightened, and if he pursues this path, he pursues the path of =\r\n\nenlightenment. He sought eudaimonia, and he has found it in knowledge.5 Ev=\r\nen though many people had repeatedly spoken of the same =E2=80=98knowledge=\r\n=E2=80=99 \nfrom his tradition, it did not appear to help him before his que=\r\nst \nbegan. That is because this knowledge is of another type: it is an expe=\r\nriential knowledge that involves his situation.  \nIn other words, this pers=\r\non realises that all his endeavours, projects, \ndreams, desires and frustra=\r\ntions were never really =E2=80=98his=E2=80=99. His \nunhappiness arose not b=\r\necause these projects were pursued, but because \nhe thought they were =E2=\r\n=80=98his=E2=80=99. He has still to work out many things: whose \nprojects w=\r\nere they, if they were not =E2=80=98his=E2=80=99 projects? Why and from whe=\r\nre \ndid he have the experience of being an agent? etc. The important point =\r\n\nhere too is that the Indian tradition steered the middle-aged person in a =\r\nparticular way, helped him set up a loop, and generated a breakdown. \nThe m=\r\niddle-aged man must now emerge out of it, and use his insight to \nreconstit=\r\nute his personality in a way that is in consonance with his \nexperience.&quot;\n\n=\r\nRegards,\naa no bhadraaH kratavo yantu vishvataH\n\nRajagopal\n\n\n"}}
