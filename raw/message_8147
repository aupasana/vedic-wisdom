Help needed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;First of all, thanks to all of you, many many times for taking ti=\r\nme to address my issue. You have no idea how much support morally you guys =\r\nhave provided me. Now coming to the suggestion that were given, i will list=\r\n them down here and mention which ones i am already following and which i a=\r\nm not:\n&gt;Brahmacharya: Yes, for the past several years (almost 5 yrs), i am =\r\ninto brahmacharya. Although i am a house hold leading family life, i am int=\r\no Brahmacharya as i chose to live like that. According to me, sex is only f=\r\nor reproduction. After, i got two children, i took the practise.\n&gt;Humility:=\r\n Yes, always humiliated, whenever i get abusive thoughts, i do situps, stan=\r\nd infront of god and ask for forgiveness.\n&gt;Reciting stotras: I recite lalit=\r\nha, lakshmi, sri suktham, lakshmi japam, Vishnu sahasra namam and listen to=\r\n Rudram regularily.\n&gt;Reciting stotras with open eyes instead of closed eyes=\r\n: Yes, i do the same as closed eyes make me suffer more.\n&gt;Chandi kavacha: N=\r\no, i am not reciting this. I shall start. Do i have to follow any special n=\r\niyama&#39;s? other than purifying my body.\n&gt;Disciplined life style: I will beco=\r\nme more disciplined hence forth.\n&gt;Pranayamam: No, i shall do this one as we=\r\nll\n&gt;EFT on internet: No, but not sure what does it stand for. Can u pls ela=\r\nborate so that i can google accordingly.\n&gt;Charity: Yes i am a little bit in=\r\nto it, but will expand more\n&gt;Now, what i understandd the main cause for my =\r\nsituation is a very STRONG mind and weak senses. My mind records any evil t=\r\nhings, that i see, hear very very strongly, that it keeps on repeating thos=\r\ne in such away that, evil thoughts become a part of my thought process. As =\r\nsuch, i am carrying those with me all the time and what ever i do, they get=\r\n pronounced. In other cases, i may not care much, but as far as GOD, i know=\r\n its sin, so my mind is sending some alarms as well parallely.In short, i c=\r\nompletely failed to control my mind. By the time i realized what it is turn=\r\ning me into, it took me completely.\n&gt;i also have this obsession of over cle=\r\nanliness when it comes to god. i can&#39;t offer prayers without head bath. i m=\r\naintian a strict dress code like old age Brahmins have, &quot;madi&quot; and dont tou=\r\nch anythign at home when i am doing pooja. i can&#39;t tolerate indscipline whe=\r\nn it comes to god. \n&gt;Lately, i have started homams. i am not doing them , b=\r\nut going to temple and having priest perform them. When ever i do homam, i =\r\nam getting some relief. I thank you one and all for your time. I shall foll=\r\now your guidelines and keep u all posted on my progress.

So again it was a great help in=\r\n reducing stress and mental pain and wandering.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What I will suggest th=\r\nat you should check out EFT on internet. It is a extremely potent method of=\r\n self healing and growth and protection. There are several groups which are=\r\n offering solutions to different problems using EFT.\n&gt;on you tube etc. Alth=\r\nough it is always a very good thing if there is a caring family member or f=\r\nriend to give support but many times we have to=C2=A0make certain effort ou=\r\nrselves. In learning EFT on internet you do not have to pay a single penny.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;If it is possible depending on your physical health do body detox every=\r\n 2/3 months to clean out inner system.\n&gt;I can write certain other methods b=\r\nut it might make you more confused and I certainly do not want it.\n&gt;\n&gt;What =\r\never you decide , Do not leave your everyday prayers and jap etc. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thank=\r\ns\n&gt;LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From: rchalla75 &lt;rchalla75@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Monday, 16 April 2012, 10:05\n&gt;Subject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Please save me!

Kindly do not judge me based on my condition, rather giv=\r\ne me some positive solution and perspective to what I am going through.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nI am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong devotee. I love to wors=\r\nhip him as much as I can.however, all my passion, interest seems to get dra=\r\nined and discouraged due to my mindset and the hell I go through because of=\r\n it. I always , always get negative & abusive thoughts and tie those to the=\r\n god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or foul =\r\nmy mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start abusing god with the same =\r\nfoul language.\n&gt;When I do Japam, =C2=A0my mind would not get concentration,=\r\n but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts.\n&gt;I can&#39;t see directly i=\r\nnto the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusing him I can&#39;t focus my d=\r\nrishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul...most specially foul=\r\n language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which means I don=\r\n&#39;t give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive me from suc=\r\nh pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love him. I want t=\r\no pray him.=C2=A0\n&gt;Currently, my mind and it&#39;s racing evil & foul thoughts =\r\nhave become a road block in my devotion and trying to keep me away from him=\r\n as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominated me and I had to =\r\nstay away from praying him for a while.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now my questions are\n&gt;Am I a Mah=\r\na papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?\n&gt;Why does it happen to m=\r\ne?\n&gt;Is it some kind of disorder\n&gt;Am in incurring wrath of god=C2=A0\n&gt;I am s=\r\ncared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 =\r\nbirths\n&gt;What can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to concentr=\r\nate on him\n&gt;I want to worship god like every one does\n&gt;I am highly stressed=\r\n because of this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always in pain=\r\n because of this stress.\n&gt;\n&gt;Please help me , but do no hate me. Please do n=\r\not disregard or discard my email.

You have no ide=\r\na how much support morally you guys have provided me. Now coming to the sug=\r\ngestion that were given, i will list them down here and mention which ones =\r\ni am already following and which i am not:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brahmacharya&lt;/B&gt;: Yes, for the past several years (almost 5 yrs), i a=\r\nm into brahmacharya. Although i am a house hold leading family life, i am i=\r\nnto Brahmacharya as i chose to live like that. According to me, sex is only=\r\n for reproduction. After, i got two children, i took the practise.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Humility&lt;/B&gt;: Yes, always humiliated, whenever i get abusive thoughts=\r\n, i do situps, stand infront of god and ask for forgiveness.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;=\r\nReciting stotras&lt;/B&gt;: I recite lalitha, lakshmi, sri suktham, lakshmi japam=\r\n, Vishnu sahasra namam and listen to Rudram regularily.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Recit=\r\ning stotras with open eyes instead of&lt;/B&gt; &lt;B&gt;closed eyes&lt;/B&gt;: Yes, i do the=\r\n same as closed eyes make me suffer more.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Chandi =\r\nkavacha&lt;/B&gt;: No, i am not reciting this. I shall start. Do i have to follow=\r\n any special niyama&#39;s? other than purifying my body.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Discipli=\r\nned life &lt;/B&gt;style: I will become more disciplined hence forth.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;B&gt;Pranayamam&lt;/B&gt;: No, i shall do this one as well&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;EFT on int=\r\nernet&lt;/B&gt;: No, but not sure what does it stand for. Can u pls elaborate so =\r\nthat i can google accordingly.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Charity: Yes i am a little bit in=\r\nto it, but will expand more&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Now, what i understandd =\r\nthe main cause for my situation is a very STRONG mind and weak senses. My m=\r\nind records any evil things, that i see, hear very very strongly, that it k=\r\neeps on repeating those in such away that, evil thoughts become a part of m=\r\ny thought process. As such, i am carrying those with me all the time and wh=\r\nat ever i do, they get pronounced. In other cases, i may not care much, but=\r\n as far as GOD, i know its sin, so my mind is sending some alarms as well p=\r\narallely.In short, i completely failed to control my mind. By the time i re=\r\nalized what it is turning me into, it took me completely.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;i also have this obsession of over cleanliness when it comes to god. =\r\ni can&#39;t offer prayers without head bath. i maintian a strict dress code lik=\r\ne old age Brahmins have, &quot;madi&quot; and dont touch anythign at home when i am d=\r\noing pooja. i can&#39;t tolerate indscipline when it comes to god. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Lately, i have started homams. i am not doing them , but going =\r\nto temple and having priest perform them. When ever i do homam, i am gettin=\r\ng some relief. I thank you one and all for your time. I shall follow your g=\r\nuidelines and keep u all posted on my progress. I need that support so that=\r\n i can continue my devotional journey without the afraid of getting a &quot;sinn=\r\ner&quot; tag.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Best Regards and heartful pranamams,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;Challa&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-W=\r\nEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;F=\r\nONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, April 17, 2012 7:10 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Plea=\r\nse save me!
