We are about 5,000 y=\r\nears into Kali \n&gt; yuga and another 427,000 years are left before this cycle=\r\n ends and \n&gt; another cycle starts.\n&gt; \n&gt; As per Krishna&#39;s teachings in Srima=\r\ndBhagavatam, about 5,000 years at the \n&gt; beginning of Kali yuga will see dh=\r\narma decay badly on earth. Next 5,000 \n&gt; years will see increasing dharma o=\r\nn earth. After that, dharma will decay \n&gt; unchecked. We are at the cusp of =\r\ndecay in dharma stopping and increase \n&gt; in dharma starting.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the ne=\r\nxt 5-20 years, there will be big changes on earth. Natural \n&gt; disasters lik=\r\ne earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, volcano erruptions \n&gt; will occur more =\r\nfrequently than usual, hit areas dwelt by masses more \n&gt; frequently than us=\r\nual and happen in such a way as to cause major blows \n&gt; to our modern capit=\r\nalistic civilization. Capitalism as we know it will \n&gt; give way to a more d=\r\nharmik way of living. Consumption bubble (which is \n&gt; the root cause of all=\r\n other bubbles we saw - stock market bubble, real \n&gt; estate bubble etc) wil=\r\nl burst and blatant consumerism will go away. It \n&gt; will be replaced by res=\r\npect for nature and a more natural and dharmik \n&gt; way of living.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoug=\r\nh end of 2012 IS interesting astrologically and the second half of \n&gt; 2012 =\r\nwill bring some major changes, 2015 and 2016 are more interesting \n&gt; and wi=\r\nll bring some big changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are in the middle (near the beginning) o=\r\nf epic geo-political and \n&gt; civilizational changes on earth that happen onc=\r\ne every few millennia. \n&gt; Though all big changes involves chaos and some de=\r\nstruction of life and \n&gt; material things, this change will result in a bett=\r\ner and more \n&gt; sustainable civilization on earth. This will be good for the=\r\n future of \n&gt; earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Individually, to cope with the changes better in =\r\nthe coming decade, \n&gt; increase your spiritual practices and develop a calm,=\r\n stable, focused \n&gt; and detached mind that can engage in powerful and passi=\r\nonate actions and \n&gt; yet be unaffected by the end result of those actions. =\r\nWhatever we get, \n&gt; whatever happens around us, belongs to god and we are t=\r\nemporary visitors \n&gt; here and caretakers. Enjoy what comes your way, but do=\r\nn&#39;t think it is \n&gt; yours. It is god&#39;s. Fully imbibing this attitude require=\r\ns a lot of \n&gt; practice (spiritual sadhana).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                 =\r\n   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-astrology=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagaraj1946&quot; &lt;nagaraj1946@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; respected =\r\nastrologers\n&gt; &gt; Many astrologers are predicting the world may come to an en=\r\nd on \n&gt; &gt; Dec21,2012. what is the correct psotion and what does the vedic \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; astrology say about this or any reference are there in vedic astrology\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; nagaraj\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
