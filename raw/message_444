But Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa stands out in one way. He is one master who mastered every single pat=\r\nh. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He=\r\n worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even=\r\n reached the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no &quot;experience&quot;. H=\r\ne was in sahaja samadhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in=\r\n people by mere touch or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had =\r\nzero ego (that is why he could do all that!!!).\n \nMany &quot;gurus&quot; force their =\r\ndharma on their sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature an=\r\nd dharma of each sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant,=\r\n worship the form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had=\r\n deep insight into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instruc=\r\ntions. He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms and tot=\r\nally different paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory thi=\r\nngs to different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive=\r\n attitude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on =\r\nyou. With your attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to=\r\n him. You should learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place =\r\nyour guru in a good stead and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who=\r\n needed to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some pe=\r\nople and came away silently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you. Shastras say tha=\r\nt you should kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong =\r\nbehavior? You should give them a piece of your mind.&quot;\n \nSpiritual sadhana d=\r\noes not mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a=\r\n certain period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which=\r\n one transforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, eve=\r\nry action and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for=\r\n introspection and transformation of internal attitude.\n \nAnyway, coming ba=\r\nck to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He b=\r\nelonged to a very special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru =\r\nto an exceptional group of sishyas.\n \nWithout his [indirect] blessings, I w=\r\nould be a nobody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able to say a=\r\nnything intelligent or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who are impre=\r\nssed/inspired by something I write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish =\r\nPandit and to Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace using me as an inst=\r\nrument and not to me.\n \nBTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you =\r\nlike to people who may be interested in spiritual discussions. I have no pr=\r\noblem. As I said before, I am a servant distributing the wealth of a king (=\r\nMother) as asked by the minister (my guru).\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n  Sent: Sunday, September 28, 2008 2:44 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRe: Dharma\n\n        Dear Narasimhaji\n\n        Another wonderly inspired pos=\r\nt by you!!!!\n\n        I did not understand one line of your post.

Krishna clearly says in \n  =\r\n        Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow s=\r\nomeone \n          else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\n          Following the path of dharma b=\r\nasically means engaging in the right \n          action/duty. Right action v=\r\naries from person to person, from time to time \n          and from place to=\r\n place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, \n          which i=\r\nn turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you \n       =\r\n   did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in t=\r\nhe \n          past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, wha=\r\nt debts you \n          created in the process, and what mental tendencies y=\r\nou accumulated until \n          now.\n\n          If, based on one&#39;s mental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n          to kill evil p=\r\nersons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \n          ten=\r\ndencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \n =\r\n         uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based =\r\non one&#39;s \n          mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pers=\r\non to spread the \n          ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;=\r\ns dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n          mental tendencies and karmic debts,=\r\n nature wants a person to make a lot of \n          money and construct a te=\r\nmple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n          * * *\n\n          The dharma of =\r\na being may change from one life to another.\n\n          At the time of Maha=\r\nbharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \n          elders an=\r\nd relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight \n       =\r\n   on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendo=\r\nus \n          destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a=\r\n great extent, \n          to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arj=\r\nuna being a great warrior, \n          it was his dharma to facilitate that.=\r\n Some people he deeply loved and \n          respected were on the other sid=\r\ne and it was his dharma to kill them.\n\n          When the same Arjuna was b=\r\norn again in the 19th century as one of \n          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;=\r\n s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n          previous life, =\r\naccording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \n          new=\r\n time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n       =\r\n   aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \n=\r\n          generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and ser=\r\nvice to \n          others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per w=\r\nhat Ramakrishna \n          said), his dharma based on the time and place ma=\r\ny be something else.\n\n          * * *\n\n          The tricky question is: Ho=\r\nw does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\n          Some people have interpr=\r\neted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n          and not some=\r\none else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \n          o=\r\nf caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of =\r\n\n          caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who liv=\r\ned by \n          killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. =\r\nVishwamitra was a \n          kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a bra=\r\nhmana and and a maharshi \n          later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s apti=\r\ntude. One starts off with the varna \n          of father, because that is w=\r\nhat one is exposed to in childhood. As one \n          develops in life, one=\r\n gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\n          Thus, the misinter=\r\npretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n          dharma=\r\n from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n     =\r\n     the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\n          Knowing what =\r\none&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n          enou=\r\ngh, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n  =\r\n        mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lo=\r\nt of \n          noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things=\r\n. Thus, we get \n          confused.\n\n          We should make the best judg=\r\nment combining discrimination and intuition and \n          decide what is o=\r\nur dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \n          the =\r\nbest we can is all that we can do!\n\n          More than following dharma, w=\r\nhat is of utmost importance is to engage in \n          actions without iden=\r\ntification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \n          accumulating ne=\r\nw karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \n          too =\r\nmuch attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n       =\r\n   possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the g=\r\niven \n          situation is), with as little attachment and self-identific=\r\nation with the \n          action as possible. When the action is finished, =\r\nwe should leave the result \n          to god. We should not think &quot;I did it=\r\n&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n          work&quot; etc. Such adherence of=\r\n nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n          untached action) will s=\r\nimplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \n          As we becom=\r\ne purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n         =\r\n There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n=\r\n          dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This i=\r\ns not easy, \n          but not as difficult as people think.\n\n          The=\r\n bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n=\r\n          &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in acti=\r\non with \n          little attachment.\n\n          * * *\n\n          In decidi=\r\nng one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n          A=\r\nnother external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n=\r\n          derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s =\r\nspiritual \n          master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one c=\r\nan take the words of \n          the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and fo=\r\nllow it sincerely.\n\n          When Arjuna was confused about what his dharm=\r\na was and thought killing gurus \n          and relatives was not dharma, he=\r\n had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n          dharma. When Narendrana=\r\nth (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n          and wanted =\r\nto renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n          =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the materia=\r\nl \n          world and do the work of Mother for him.\n\n          One who is=\r\n not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n        =\r\n  debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of wha=\r\nt \n          one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clea=\r\nr insight into \n          one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect gu=\r\nidance.\n\n          * * *\n\n          Bottomline is that I (or anybody) canno=\r\nt outline a set of principles and \n          declare that as the dharma.

Right action varies from person to person, from =\r\ntime \n          to time &lt;BR&gt;and from place to place. It is dependent on wha=\r\nt nature \n          expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;which in turn is based on who you=\r\n have been in \n          the past, what actions you &lt;BR&gt;did in the past whi=\r\nle identifying with \n          the action, who you affected in the &lt;BR&gt;past=\r\n (and how) with the \n          actions that you identified with, what debts=\r\n you &lt;BR&gt;created in the \n          process, and what mental tendencies you =\r\naccumulated until \n          &lt;BR&gt;now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If, based on one&#39;s mental tend=\r\nencies and karmic debts, \n          nature wants a person &lt;BR&gt;to kill evil =\r\npersons, that becomes one&#39;s \n          dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;tendencies and karmic debts, \n          nature wants a person to spread t=\r\nhe message of &lt;BR&gt;uniformity of all \n          religions, that becomes one&#39;=\r\ns dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental \n          tendencies and karmic de=\r\nbts, nature wants a person to spread the \n          &lt;BR&gt;ritual of homam in =\r\nthe world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based \n          on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;men=\r\ntal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n          to make a=\r\n lot of &lt;BR&gt;money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s \n          dha=\r\nrma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dharma of a being may change from one \n       =\r\n   life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the time of Mahabharata war, it was \n        =\r\n  Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, &lt;BR&gt;elders and relatives. The time \n  =\r\n        then was such that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;on earth and natur=\r\ne \n          wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;des=\r\ntruction \n          was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great=\r\n extent, &lt;BR&gt;to \n          welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjun=\r\na being a great \n          warrior, &lt;BR&gt;it was his dharma to facilitate tha=\r\nt. Some people he \n          deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;respected were on the oth=\r\ner side and it was his \n          dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the same=\r\n Arjuna was born again in the \n          19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami \n          Yogananda had been Arjuna in =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;previous life, according to \n          Ramakrishna) , his dharma was =\r\ndifferent in this &lt;BR&gt;new time and \n          place. He was born to renounc=\r\ne material life despite his \n          &lt;BR&gt;aristocratic upbringing and live=\r\n the simple life of a monk and \n          inspire &lt;BR&gt;generations to embrac=\r\ne a simple life of mental detachment \n          and service to &lt;BR&gt;others. =\r\nWhen he is born again (which he has to, as \n          per what Ramakrishna =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;said), his dharma based on the time and place \n          may be somethi=\r\nng else.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tricky question is: How \n          does on=\r\ne decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people have \n          interpret=\r\ned Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;and not \n          so=\r\nmeone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \n         =\r\n &lt;BR&gt;of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the \n    =\r\n      concept of &lt;BR&gt;caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a \n   =\r\n       shudra who lived by &lt;BR&gt;killing birds. He became a brahmana and a \n =\r\n         maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;kshatrita and a powerful kin=\r\ng. \n          He became a brahmana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;later. Basically =\r\nvarna \n          shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;of=\r\n father, \n          because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As=\r\n one \n          &lt;BR&gt;develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on wha=\r\nt one \n          does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s word=\r\ns which \n          tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;dharma from your caste is wro=\r\nng. Moreover, \n          there are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;the world. Eac=\r\nh person has \n          individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma=\r\n is is very very \n          very difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;enough, one =\r\nwill *know* one&#39;s \n          dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;mind that tells us \n          what our dharma is, but it is surrounded =\r\nby a lot of &lt;BR&gt;noise from \n          other parts of our minds which tell o=\r\nther things. Thus, we get \n          &lt;BR&gt;confused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We should make th=\r\ne best judgment combining \n          discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;d=\r\necide what is our dharma and \n          follow it sincerely. We may be err,=\r\n but doing &lt;BR&gt;the best we can is \n          all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mor=\r\ne than following dharma, what is of \n          utmost importance is to enga=\r\nge in &lt;BR&gt;actions without identification. \n          *That* alone ensures t=\r\nhat we are not &lt;BR&gt;accumulating new karmas, i.e. \n          not increasing =\r\nthe load. We should not build &lt;BR&gt;too much attachment \n          to what we=\r\n are doing. We should engage in the best &lt;BR&gt;possible \n          actions (b=\r\nased on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \n          &lt;BR&gt;si=\r\ntuation is), with as little attachment and self-identification \n          w=\r\nith the &lt;BR&gt;action as possible. When the action is finished, we \n          =\r\nshould leave the result &lt;BR&gt;to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, \n      =\r\n    &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adherence of \n    =\r\n      nishkama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;untached action) will \n  =\r\n        simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;As we bec=\r\nome \n          purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma cleare=\r\nr. \n          &lt;BR&gt;There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enabl=\r\ne us to \n          see our &lt;BR&gt;dharma clearly and follow it without incurri=\r\nng new karmas. \n          This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;but not as difficult as peo=\r\nple think.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The \n          bottomline is: Even if one is not followin=\r\ng one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense \n          of &lt;BR&gt;&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refi=\r\nned with time if one engages in \n          action with &lt;BR&gt;little attachmen=\r\nt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In deciding \n          one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect=\r\n and intuition are the inputs. \n          &lt;BR&gt;Another external input is the=\r\n words of scriptures and learned men. \n          One can &lt;BR&gt;derive one&#39;s d=\r\nharma from them. A special place is given to \n          one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, \n          one can take t=\r\nhe words of &lt;BR&gt;the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and \n          follow =\r\nit sincerely.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Arjuna was confused about what his \n          dha=\r\nrma was and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;and relatives was not dharma, \n      =\r\n    he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his &lt;BR&gt;dharma. When \n          =\r\nNarendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR&gt;and \n   =\r\n       wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhan=\r\na, \n          &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to s=\r\ntay in \n          the material &lt;BR&gt;world and do the work of Mother for him.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One \n          who is not in tune with nature and does not know who=\r\n one is, what \n          one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;debts are and what nature expects from o=\r\nne can err in the \n          judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s=\r\n guru is an elevated \n          soul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s in=\r\nner core, such a guru can \n          give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that I (or \n          anybody) cannot outline a set of p=\r\nrinciples and &lt;BR&gt;declare that as \n          the dharma. No, dharma changes=\r\n from person to person, from &lt;BR&gt;time to \n          time and from place to =\r\nplace. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \n          &lt;BR&gt;out what one&#39;s =\r\ndharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding \n          of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ndharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various \n          kinds of =\r\nspiritual &lt;BR&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in \n          ac=\r\ntions without much &lt;BR&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and \n     =\r\n     refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best=\r\n \n          regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- \n          --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n   =\r\n       href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n     =\r\n     rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri =\r\n\n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tar=\r\npana&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n          Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; \n     =\r\n     target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. \n     =\r\n     net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath \n          Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan \n          nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----=\r\n- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: \n          &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:dahiyajiten%40yahoo.co.in&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: \n          &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Saturday, \n          Septemb=\r\ner 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] \n          Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i just finished my \n          Aghora serie=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalanda says \n          path of =\r\ndharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on \n          tha=\r\nt and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it has to \n      =\r\n    do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n          jitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY=\r\n&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_030D_01C92199.C71F7410--\r\n\n"}}
