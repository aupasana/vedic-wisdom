We provide here some details=\r\n\non how Vedas have been preserved so purely and how its not possible to\nalt=\r\ner even a single syllable. No other text in the world can claim to have\nsuc=\r\nh fail-safe method of preservation.*\n\nOur forefathers devised a number of m=\r\nethods to preserve the unwritten Vedas\nin their original form, to safeguard=\r\n their tonal and verbal purity.\n*Swara Protection of Vedas*\n\nThey laid down=\r\n rules to make sure that not even a syllable was changed in\nchanting, not e=\r\nven a svara was altered. In this way they ensured that the\nfull benefits we=\r\nre derived from intoning the mantras. They fixed the time\ntaken to enunciat=\r\ne each syllable of a word and called this unit of time or\ntime interval =93=\r\nmatra=94.\n\nHow we must regulate our breathing to produce the desired vibrat=\r\nion in a\nparticular part of our body so that the sound of the syllable enun=\r\nciated is\nproduced in its pure form: this science is explained in the Vedan=\r\nga called\nShiksha.\n\nIf you see a Vedic mantra in the Samhita, you would fin=\r\nd certain marks\nafter syllables. For example see the following image:\n\n&lt;htt=\r\np://cdn.agniveer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rigveda2.gif&gt;\n\nThese marks =\r\ncalled Swara Chinha depict the method of pronunciation.

Thus you would see them moving\ntheir han=\r\nds or head while reciting the Vedic mantras. And if a slightest\nerror in Sw=\r\nara is found in recitation, they would easily pin-point it.\n\nFurther, diffe=\r\nrent gurukuls specialize in studying different Patha methods\n(explained aft=\r\ner this section) would still have the same Swara system in\nplace, thereby e=\r\nasily tracking accuracy of each Vedic mantra to last\nsyllable.\n   [image: v=\r\nedas_myth_and_reality_eng]&lt;http://agnikart.com/in/agniveer-recommends/vedas=\r\n-the-myth-and-reality&gt;\n\n*Vedas Myth and Reality (English)*\n\n [image: The 4 =\r\nVedas Complete\n(Hindi)]&lt;http://agnikart.com/in/agniveer-recommends/complete=\r\n-set-of-4-vedas-hindi&gt;\n\n*The 4 Vedas Complete (Hindi)*\n  [image: Buy Now]&lt;h=\r\nttp://agnikart.com/in/agniveer-recommends/vedas-the-myth-and-reality&gt;\n\n [im=\r\nage: Buy Now]&lt;http://agnikart.com/in/agniveer-recommends/complete-set-of-4-=\r\nvedas-hindi&gt;\n   *Paatha Protection of Vedas*\n\nA remarkable method was devis=\r\ned to make sure that words and syllables are\nnot altered. According to this=\r\n the words of a mantra are strung together in\ndifferent patterns like =93va=\r\nkya=94, =93pada=94, =93karma=94, =93jata=94, =93mala=94, =93sikha=94,\n=93re=\r\nkha=94, =93dhvaja=94, =93danda=94, =93ratha=94, =93ghana=94. These represen=\r\nt different\npermutations of reciting words of a Vedic Mantra.\n\nWe call some=\r\n Vedic scholars =93ghanapathins=94, don=92t we? It means they have\nlearnt t=\r\nhe chanting of the scripture up to the advanced stage called\n=93ghana=94. =\r\n=93Pathin=94 means one who has learnt the =93patha=94. When we listen to\ngh=\r\nanapathins chant the ghana, we notice that they intone a few words of a\nman=\r\ntra in different ways, back and forth.\n\nIt is most delightful to the ear, l=\r\nike nectar poured into it. The sonority\nnatural to Vedic chanting is enhanc=\r\ned in ghana. Similarly, in the other\nmethods of chanting like karma, jata, =\r\nsikha, mala, and so on the intonation\nis nothing less than stately, indeed =\r\ndivine.\n\nThe chief purpose of such methods, as already mentioned, is to ens=\r\nure that\nnot even a syllable of a mantra is altered to the slightest extent=\r\n. The\nwords are braided together, so to speak, and recited back and forth.\n=\r\n\nIn =93vakyapatha=94 and =93samhitapatha=94 the mantras are chanted in the =\r\noriginal\n(natural) order, with no special pattern adopted. In the vakyapath=\r\na some\nwords of the mantras are joined together in what is called =93sandhi=\r\n=94. There\nis sandhi in Tamil also; but in English the words are not joined=\r\n together.\nYou have many examples of sandhi in the Tevaram, Tiruvachakam, T=\r\nirukkural,\nDivyaprabandham and other Tamil works. Because of the sandhi the=\r\n individual\nwords are less recognisable in Sanskrit than even in Tamil.\n\nIn=\r\n padapatha each word in a mantra is clearly separated from the next. It\ncom=\r\nes next to samhitapatha and after it is kramapatha. In this the first\nword =\r\nof a mantra is joined to the second, the second to the third, the\nthird to =\r\nthe fourth, and so on, until we come to the final word.\n\nIn old inscription=\r\ns in the South we find the names of some important people\nof the place conc=\r\nerned mentioned with the appellation =93kramavittan=94 added\nto the names. =\r\n=93Kramavittan=94 is the Tamil form of =93kramavid=94 in the same way\nas =\r\n=93Vedavittan=94 is of =93Vedavid=94. We learn from the inscriptions that s=\r\nuch\nVedic scholars were to be met throughout South India in past.\n\n*(Note t=\r\nhat South India has a great contribution in preserving the Vedic\ntraditions=\r\n during a critical long era of history when North India was\noccupied in str=\r\nuggling for survival from brutal attacks of barbaric\ninvaders and their pro=\r\ngenies from West Asia. We find the tradition of Vedic\ngurukuls uninterrupte=\r\nd even till today.)*\n\nIn jata patha, the first word of the mantra is chante=\r\nd with the second,\nthen the order is reversed-the second is chanted with th=\r\ne first. Then,\nagain, the first word is chanted with the second, then the s=\r\necond with the\nthird, and so on. In this way the entire mantra is chanted, =\r\ngoing back and\nforth.\n\nIn shikhapatha the pattern consists of three words o=\r\nf a mantra, instead of\nthe two of jata.\n\nGhanapatha is more difficult than =\r\nthese. There are four types in this\nmethod. Here also the words of a mantra=\r\n are chanted back and forth and\nthere is a system of permutation and combin=\r\nation in the chanting. To\nexplain all of it would be like conducting a clas=\r\ns of arithmetic.\n\nWe take all kinds of precautions in the laboratory, don=\r\n=92t we, to protect a\nlife-saving drug? The sound of the Vedas guards the w=\r\norld against all ills.\nOur forefathers devised these methods of chanting to=\r\n protect the sound of\nour scripture against change and distortion.\n\nSamhita=\r\npatha and padapatha are called =93prakrtipatha=94 (natural way of\nchanting)=\r\n since the words are recited only once and in their natural order.\nThe othe=\r\nr methods belong to the =93vikrtipatha=94 (artificial way of chanting)\ncate=\r\ngory. (In krama, though the words do not go in the strict natural order\nof =\r\none-two-three, there is no reversal of the words-the first after the\nsecond=\r\n, the second after the third, and so on. So we cannot describe it\nfully as =\r\nvikrtipatha). Leaving out krama, there are eight vikrti patterns\nand they a=\r\nre recounted in verse to be easily remembered.\n\n*Jata mala sikha rekha dhva=\r\nja dando ratho ghanah*\n\n*Ityastau-vikrtayah proktah kramapurva maharsibhih*=\r\n\n\n* *All these different methods of chanting are meant to ensure the tonal\n=\r\nand verbal purity of the Vedas for all time. In pada the words in their\nnat=\r\nural order, in krama two words together, in jata the words going back\nand f=\r\north. The words tally in all these methods of chanting and there is\nthe ass=\r\nurance that the original form will not be altered.\n\nThe benefits to be deri=\r\nved from the different ways of chanting are given in\nthis verse.\n\n*Samhitap=\r\nathamatrena yatphalam procyate budhaih*\n\n*Padu tu dvigunam vidyat krame tu =\r\nca caturgunam*\n\n*Varnakrame satagunam jatayantu sahasrakam*\n\nConsidering th=\r\nat our ancestors took so much care to make sure that the\nsound of the Vedas=\r\n did not undergo the slightest change, it is futile for\nmodern researchers =\r\nto try to establish the date of our scriptures by\nfinding out how the sound=\r\ns of its words have changed.\n\nWhat more, today different schools of Vedas e=\r\nxist in south who memorize\nvedas in different means, as explained above. An=\r\nd if you compare the\nmantras memorized by different schools, you will find =\r\nvariation of not a\nsingle syllable. Remember we are talking lacs of syllabl=\r\nes!! And still no\nvariations. Thats why even Max Muller, a bitter critic of=\r\n Vedic philosophy,\ncould also not help but state that such a foolproof meth=\r\nod of preservation\nis among the greatest wonders and miracles of the world!=\r\n\nAn example of Ghana Patha\n\n(Reference Source: http://www.krishnamurthys.co=\r\nm/profvk/index.html )\n\nThis example gives a faint glimpse of how the vedas =\r\nin spite of its massive\ncontent, (Rg veda and Yajur veda have 153,826 words=\r\n and 109,287 words\nrespectively) have been preserved from generation to gen=\r\neration though it\nwas all done only by oral transmission.\n\nWe give below a =\r\nsentence from the Yajur veda, obviously without the svaras,\nin its original=\r\n samhita pATha form, also its pada text and then the order\nof the words in =\r\nthe ghana recital. A pundit who has learnt the Ghana\nrecital of one complet=\r\ne veda (he takes thirteen years of whole time work to\nreach that stage) is =\r\ncalled a ghana-pAThi.\n\nFirst we give the rule for the ghana mechanics of re=\r\ncitation:\n\nIf the original order of words in a sentence is:\n\n1/2/3/4/5\n\nThe=\r\n ghana recital goes as follows:\n\n12/21/123/321/123/\n\n23/32/234/432/234/\n\n34=\r\n/43/345/543/345/\n\n45/54/45/\n\n5 iti 5.\nExample:\n\n*samhita sentence:*\n\neshAm =\r\npurushANAm-eshAm paSUnAM mA bher-mA ro-mo eshAM kincanAmamat //\n\n*Meaning:*=\r\n\n\nOh God!

The recital is a non-stop recital, except for a\nhalf-pause at the place =\r\nshown by / . There is no break anywhere else.

This must be considered a great lin=\r\ngusitic achievement of which\nIndia can be legitimately proud. The literatur=\r\ne, which consists of diverse\npoetical and prose compositions were simply le=\r\narnt by rote, the training\nbeing given by the teacher saying each word or c=\r\nombinations of words once\nwith the proper incantations *(called svaras)* an=\r\nd the students saying it\ntwice. They then learnt to recite it in continuous=\r\n form along with the\nincantations. The continuous recitation of a vedic tex=\r\nt is called *samhita\npAtha*. The accuracy of the text is preserved by resor=\r\nting to an artifice\nof nine different techniques or modes of recital.\n\nThe =\r\nfirst is the *pada pATha*, which simply recites each word of the text\nsepar=\r\nately; pada means word; pAtha means reading.The euphonic changes that\noccur=\r\ns from the samhita pATha to the pada pATha is itself very technical\n(Sanskr=\r\nit grammar would be crucial here) but makes sense.\n\nIn addition, there are =\r\neight other techniques of recitation, the sole\npurpose of each is to preser=\r\nve the original samhita text without the loss\nor addtion of a single syllab=\r\nle or svara. The svaras are a significant part\nof the recital of the vedas,=\r\n whatever be the mode. The eight modes are\ncalled:\n\nkrama, jaTa, ghana, mAl=\r\nA, ratha, ShikhA, daNDa and rekhA.\n\nIn each mode the order of recital of th=\r\ne words is specified as a particular\npermutation of their original sequence=\r\n.\n\nAll these elaborate and sophisticated approaches have ensured that the\nf=\r\nirst texts of humanity =96 The Veda Samhitas =96 are available to us today =\r\nin\nexactly the same pure original form.\n\n*This article is also available in=\r\n Hindi at*\nhttp://agniveer.com/3887/why-vedas-cannot-be-changed-hi/\n\nwith b=\r\nest wishes\n\nVashi\nTeam Agniveer\nhttp://agniveer.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.c=\r\nom/agniveeragni\nhttps://twitter.com/agniveer\n\r\n--f46d042dfc8759af9904d836b917\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/no-textual-corruption-in-vedas/&quot;&gt;&lt;img cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-2701&quot; alt=3D&quot;&quot; src=3D&quot;http://i2.wp.com=\r\n/agniveer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/03-1.jpg?resize=3D300%2C191&quot; heigh=\r\nt=3D&quot;191&quot; width=3D&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1 class=3D&quot;entry-title&quot;&gt;No textual corru=\r\nption in Vedas&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;(READ THIS CAREFULLY IF YOU HAVE QUERY ON HOW DO WE E=\r\nNSURE THAT VEDAS\n ARE UNALTERABLE SINCE AGES.

According to this the words of a mantra are strung \ntogeth=\r\ner in different patterns like =93vakya=94, =93pada=94, =93karma=94, =93jata=\r\n=94, \n=93mala=94, =93sikha=94, =93rekha=94, =93dhvaja=94, =93danda=94, =93r=\r\natha=94, =93ghana=94. These \nrepresent different permutations of reciting w=\r\nords of a Vedic Mantra.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We call some Vedic scholars =93ghanapathins=\r\n=94, don=92t we? It means they \nhave learnt the chanting of the scripture u=\r\np to the advanced stage \ncalled =93ghana=94. =93Pathin=94 means one who has=\r\n learnt the =93patha=94. When we \nlisten to ghanapathins chant the ghana, w=\r\ne notice that they intone a few\n words of a mantra in different ways, back =\r\nand forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is most=A0delightful to the ear, like nectar poured in=\r\nto it. The \nsonority natural to Vedic chanting is enhanced in ghana. Simila=\r\nrly, in \nthe other methods of chanting like karma, jata, sikha, mala, and s=\r\no on \nthe intonation is nothing less than stately, indeed divine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Th=\r\ne chief=A0purpose of such methods, as already mentioned, is to ensure\n that=\r\n not even a syllable of a mantra is altered to the slightest \nextent. The w=\r\nords are braided together, so to speak, and recited back \nand forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p=\r\n&gt;In =93vakyapatha=94 and =93samhitapatha=94 the mantras are chanted in the =\r\n\noriginal (natural) order, with no special pattern adopted. In the \nvakyapa=\r\ntha some words of the mantras are joined together in what is \ncalled =93san=\r\ndhi=94. There is sandhi in Tamil also; but in English the words\n are not jo=\r\nined together. You have many examples of sandhi in the \nTevaram, Tiruvachak=\r\nam, Tirukkural, Divyaprabandham and other Tamil \nworks. Because of the sand=\r\nhi the individual words are less recognisable \nin Sanskrit than even in Tam=\r\nil.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In padapatha each word in a mantra is clearly separated from the=\r\n \nnext. It comes next to=A0samhitapatha and after it is kramapatha. In this=\r\n \nthe first word of a mantra is joined to the second, the second to the \nth=\r\nird, the third to the fourth, and so on, until we come to the final \nword.&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In old inscriptions in the South we find the names of some important=\r\n \npeople of the place concerned mentioned with the appellation \n=93kramavit=\r\ntan=94 added to the names. =93Kramavittan=94 is the Tamil form of \n=93krama=\r\nvid=94 in the same way as =93Vedavittan=94 is of =93Vedavid=94. We learn \nf=\r\nrom the inscriptions that such Vedic scholars were to be met throughout\n So=\r\nuth India in past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note that South India has a great contributi=\r\non in preserving the\n Vedic traditions during a critical long era of histor=\r\ny when North India\n was occupied in struggling for survival from brutal att=\r\nacks of barbaric\n invaders and their progenies from West Asia. We find the =\r\ntradition of \nVedic gurukuls uninterrupted even till today.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In=\r\n jata patha, the first word of the mantra is chanted with the \nsecond, then=\r\n the order is reversed-the second is chanted with the first.\n Then, again, =\r\nthe first word is chanted with the second, then the second\n with the third,=\r\n and so on. In this way the entire mantra is=A0chanted, \ngoing back and for=\r\nth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In shikhapatha the pattern consists of three words of a mantra, =\r\ninstead of the two of jata.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ghanapatha is more difficult than these.=\r\n There are four types in this\n method. Here also the words of a mantra are =\r\nchanted back and forth and \nthere is a system of permutation and combinatio=\r\nn in the chanting. To \nexplain all of it would be like conducting a class o=\r\nf arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We take all kinds of precautions in the laboratory, do=\r\nn=92t we, to \nprotect a life-saving drug? The sound of the Vedas guards the=\r\n world \nagainst all ills. Our forefathers devised these methods of chanting=\r\n to \nprotect the sound of our scripture against change and distortion.&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;Samhitapatha and padapatha are called =93prakrtipatha=94 (natural way of=\r\n \nchanting) since the words are recited only once and in their natural \nord=\r\ner. The other methods belong to the =93vikrtipatha=94 (artificial way of \nc=\r\nhanting) category. (In krama, though the words do not go in the strict \nnat=\r\nural order of one-two-three, there is no reversal of the words-the \nfirst a=\r\nfter the second, the second after the third, and so on. So we \ncannot descr=\r\nibe it fully as vikrtipatha). Leaving out krama, there are \neight vikrti pa=\r\ntterns and they are recounted in verse to be easily \nremembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em=\r\n&gt;Jata mala sikha rekha dhvaja dando ratho ghanah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ityastau-v=\r\nikrtayah proktah kramapurva maharsibhih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;All these dif=\r\nferent methods of chanting are meant to ensure\n the tonal and verbal purity=\r\n of the Vedas for all time. In pada the \nwords in their natural order, in k=\r\nrama two words together, in jata the \nwords going back and forth. The words=\r\n tally in all these methods of \nchanting and there is the assurance that th=\r\ne original form will not be \naltered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The benefits to be derived fro=\r\nm the different ways of chanting are given in this verse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samhit=\r\napathamatrena yatphalam procyate budhaih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Padu tu dvigunam v=\r\nidyat krame tu ca caturgunam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Varnakrame satagunam jatayantu=\r\n sahasrakam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Considering that our ancestors took so much care to=\r\n make sure that \nthe sound of the Vedas did not undergo the slightest chang=\r\ne, it is \nfutile for modern researchers to try to establish the date of our=\r\n \nscriptures by finding out how the sounds of its words have changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;What more, today different schools of Vedas exist in south who \nmemorize =\r\nvedas in different means, as explained above. And if you \ncompare the mantr=\r\nas memorized by different schools, you will find \nvariation of not a single=\r\n syllable. Remember we are talking lacs of \nsyllables!! And still no variat=\r\nions. Thats why even Max Muller, a=A0bitter\n critic of Vedic philosophy, co=\r\nuld also not help but state that such a \nfoolproof method of preservation i=\r\ns among the greatest wonders and \nmiracles of the world!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;An example=\r\n of Ghana Patha&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Reference Source: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.krishnamur=\r\nthys.com/profvk/index.html&quot;&gt;http://www.krishnamurthys.com/profvk/index.html=\r\n&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This example gives a faint glimpse of how the vedas in spite =\r\nof its \nmassive content, (Rg veda and Yajur veda have 153,826 words and 109=\r\n,287 \nwords respectively) have been preserved from generation to generation=\r\n \nthough it was all done only by oral transmission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We give below a =\r\nsentence from the Yajur veda, obviously without the \nsvaras, in its origina=\r\nl samhita pATha form, also its pada text and then \nthe order of the words i=\r\nn the ghana recital.

The literature, which co=\r\nnsists of\n diverse poetical and prose compositions were simply learnt by ro=\r\nte, \nthe=A0training being given by the teacher saying each word or combinat=\r\nions\n of words once with the proper incantations &lt;strong&gt;(called svaras)&lt;/s=\r\ntrong&gt;\n and the students saying it twice. They then learnt to recite it in =\r\n\ncontinuous form along with the incantations. The continuous recitation \nof=\r\n a vedic text is called &lt;strong&gt;samhita pAtha&lt;/strong&gt;. The accuracy of the=\r\n text is preserved by resorting to an artifice of nine different techniques=\r\n or modes of recital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first is the &lt;strong&gt;pada pATha&lt;/strong&gt;, =\r\nwhich simply recites \neach word of the text separately; pada means word; pA=\r\ntha means \nreading.The euphonic changes that occurs from the samhita pATha =\r\nto the \npada pATha is itself very technical (Sanskrit grammar would be cruc=\r\nial \nhere) but makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are eight other techn=\r\niques of recitation,=A0the sole\n purpose of each is to preserve the origina=\r\nl samhita text without the \nloss or addtion of a single syllable or svara. =\r\nThe svaras are a \nsignificant part of the recital of the vedas, whatever be=\r\n the mode. The \neight modes are called:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;krama, jaTa, ghana, mAlA, ra=\r\ntha, ShikhA, daNDa and rekhA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In each mode the order of recital of t=\r\nhe words is specified as a particular permutation of their original sequenc=\r\ne.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All these elaborate and sophisticated approaches have ensured tha=\r\nt \nthe first texts of humanity =96 The Veda Samhitas =96 are available to u=\r\ns \ntoday in exactly the same pure original form.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is=\r\n also available in Hindi at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/3887/why-v=\r\nedas-cannot-be-changed-hi/&quot; href=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/3887/why-vedas-cann=\r\not-be-changed-hi/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://agniveer.com/3887/why-vedas-can=\r\nnot-be-changed-hi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;with best wishes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vashi&lt;br&gt;Team Agnive=\r\ner&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://agniveer.co=\r\nm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://www.facebook.com/agniveeragni&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/agniveeragni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://twitter=\r\n.com/agniveer&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/agniveer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--f46d042dfc8759af9904d836b917--\r\n\n"}}
