This is an=\r\n unbelievable experience that I \nhave had. I have not added anything from m=\r\ny own. I am writing \nexactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to=\r\n the period of \n1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mo=\r\nod.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near =\r\n\nDwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee \nallowanc=\r\ne for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just \nopposite to Post off=\r\nice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship \nwith some Telephone op=\r\nerators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will \ncall him as Mr. Patel) was work=\r\ning as Operator. He was a staunch \ndevotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkri=\r\nshnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he \nwas always talking about shri Thaku=\r\nr. We came close day by day. \nThere was a weekly gathering at his home call=\r\ned SATSANGA. He was \nsinging devotional songs created by him and was weepin=\r\ng while \nsinging. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 \nyoungs=\r\nters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I \nwas then 24=\r\n years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go \nto seashore daily=\r\n at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only \nabout Thakur.\n&gt; One day wh=\r\nen we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some gues=\r\nt have come to my home and my wife is \nremembering me. My son will come in =\r\na few minutes to call me. I \nshall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my =\r\nsurprise his 8 years old son \ncame to call him. \n&gt; At one another incident =\r\nhe told me that there will be a plane \ncrash tomorrow and that also happene=\r\nd. I was very much impressed \nabout him. He could foresee the events. One d=\r\nay I had to go to \nDwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus =\r\ntire will be \npunctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come fro=\r\nm \nDwarka as was punctured on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; This all inci=\r\ndents made me to believe that he had some super power \nand this was due to =\r\nRamkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to \nshri Thakur. One day I thou=\r\nght, I should also be disciple of shri \nThakur and the day came. It was 4/4=\r\n/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered \nmyself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house=\r\n before Thakur picture. I \nprayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as =\r\nhis follower and \nbestow his grace. \n&gt; Next day morning I had a discussion =\r\nwith my wife at 6.10 morning \nwhile taking the tea. As my duty was to start=\r\n from 7 am I was waking \nup at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morni=\r\nng that I have \naccepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was anno=\r\nyed and \nshe argued with me a lot. =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such=\r\n a hasty \ndecision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at \nCal=\r\ncutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru should be living one, \nwho can gui=\r\nde us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from \nShri Ram Sharma =\r\nAcharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; Her arguments were=\r\n right at her place as people in general not \nknow much about Thakur and I =\r\nwas confused. I thought-- yes I have \ntaken hasty decision. I was in the in=\r\nfluence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that T=\r\nhakur was telling \ntheir disciples to test him before accepting him. I also=\r\n decided to \ntest Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CS=\r\nee, Mr. Patel \nhas never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He h=\r\nas never \nasked me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our ho=\r\nuse \nwithin 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for \nThak=\r\nur is perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; She laughed at me=E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is poss=\r\nible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr=\r\n. Patel immediately to justify my \ndecision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98=\r\nI want to test your existence even \ntoday.=E2=80=99\n&gt; To our great surprise=\r\n, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the \nmorning with angry mood. What h=\r\ne told?\n&gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what hap=\r\npened? \nYesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30=\r\n \nmornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur \npull=\r\ned my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house.=\r\n \nHe is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his \nhouse=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n&gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way \n=\r\nto your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are \ndisturbing hi=\r\nm in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99\n&gt; We both were=\r\n so excited and surprised that we had no words that \nMorning. \n&gt; I will nev=\r\ner forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. \nThere were some more D=\r\nevine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will \nwrite it sometime.\n&gt; Dear S=\r\nir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the \nearth. This is =\r\na fact I have written and no word is added to \nexaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri T=\r\nhakur bless all of us.\n&gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add=\r\n more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
