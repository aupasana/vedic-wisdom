If you =\r\nperform a homam just to\n\nshow your love to god, cleanse yourself spirituall=\r\ny and make yourself worthy of divine\n\ncommunion, then there are no risks.

You can ask your friends to join you and sit while y=\r\nou are performing the homam at you house. if they are really intrested they=\r\n will come and then leave it to Mahaganapati. if he wishes, they will also =\r\nstart taking serious intrest.\n\n\n\nlastly, Narasimha can answer you better fo=\r\nr all the questions.\n\n\n\nWarm Regards,\n\n\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com, rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Dear Nars=\r\nimhaji / Utpal,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Can we do mahaganapathi homam by sitting in differen=\r\nt directions?. .

Vijay gave t=\r\nhis details as an answer to clarify some query but see it has created a kin=\r\nd of motives other than spiritual progress, in many of us. now this thing w=\r\nill keep on lingering in our mind for long unless we mercilessly remove it.=\r\n even Narasimha mentioned few days back that Mamara is for Money, White til=\r\n for Spiritual progress etc.. and that was also sufficient for creating rip=\r\nples.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNarsimha, in his mnual, has categorically mentioned this (I =\r\ndon&#39;t know if he wish to revisit and change that)-&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[&lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly=\r\n, you have to be careful if you perform a homam for certain material goals =\r\n(such as&lt;br&gt;\ngetting money, attracting someone, destroying someone etc). If=\r\n you perform a homam just to&lt;br&gt;\nshow your love to god, cleanse yourself sp=\r\niritually and make yourself worthy of divine&lt;br&gt;\ncommunion, then there are =\r\nno risks. The procedure taught in this document is based on the&lt;br&gt;\nteachin=\r\ngs of rishis and it is safe for anybody to use. Small mistakes will not res=\r\nult in any&lt;br&gt;\npunishment.&lt;br&gt;\nIn fact, it is expected that everybody who u=\r\nses this document is interested in only the second&lt;br&gt;\nkind of goal, i.e. s=\r\npiritual cleansing and upliftment&lt;br&gt;\n]&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBUT important thing is tha=\r\nt, the knowledge provided by Narasimha and vijay about Different materials =\r\nfor Aahuti and Direction respectively, can be used for *other Jan Hitaay*. =\r\ni mean don&#39;t use it for ourself but can be used for a person who is dire di=\r\nfficulty of Finance/Health etc... for example, if you know somebody who is =\r\nin a trouble due to financial crisis, you can suggest him to do some japa f=\r\nacing North Direction. for health matters, south direction can be suggested=\r\n and finally thinking &#39;Neki kar aur dariya me dal&#39; or &#39;Krishnarpana&#39; or &#39;Sh=\r\nivarpana&#39; :)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI asked the same question to my guru initially. he to=\r\nld me that when i perform atleast 10 homa myself and become proficient in t=\r\nhe ritual then i may think of performing it at other&#39;s home. You can ask yo=\r\nur friends to join you and sit while you are performing the homam at you ho=\r\nuse. if they are really intrested they will come and then leave it to Mahag=\r\nanapati. if he wishes, they will also start taking serious intrest.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nlastly, Narasimha can answer you better for all the questions.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nW=\r\narm Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compos=\r\ne?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, =\r\nrajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear =\r\nNarsimhaji / Utpal,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Can we do mahaganapathi homam by sit=\r\nting in different directions?. .
