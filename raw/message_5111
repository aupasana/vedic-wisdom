Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from int=\r\nernet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I inte=\r\nracted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy =\r\nof the original post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and=\r\n quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general at=\r\nmosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Ha=\r\nving quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might=\r\n reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal ji has raised an important questi=\r\non regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizi=\r\nng the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE =\r\nquestion and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general o=\r\nr specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is=\r\n an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO.=\r\n However if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mant=\r\nra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2=96YES.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Mu=\r\nnde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity fo=\r\nr multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of =\r\nmultiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for s=\r\nadhana. But in the current context of this question I will restrict myself =\r\nto only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; a. Gnana marga (=\r\nAdvaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; c. Mantra marga (Ta=\r\nntric)\n&gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual p=\r\nath and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practic=\r\nalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above pat=\r\nhs EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practical=\r\nise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at th=\r\ne predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; For th=\r\nose who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even=\r\n the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from th=\r\ne wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita em=\r\nphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection).=\r\n Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retain=\r\ned the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as =\r\nan important practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big w=\r\nay with a marginal role for external practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yoga marga emphasises =\r\nAbhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity=\r\n or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapr=\r\nanidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha =\r\nand Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscrib=\r\ne to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditi=\r\nonal acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On=\r\n the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the =\r\nBhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the=\r\n mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally I will address the Tantr=\r\nic path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiatio=\r\nn and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the p=\r\nracticalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda throug=\r\nh the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab=\r\n experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should b=\r\ne remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at var=\r\nious levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is=\r\n to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one pat=\r\nh invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, an=\r\nother the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagny=\r\na and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of V=\r\nak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly=\r\n powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis=\r\n on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualification.=\r\n Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision? D=\r\noes the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other lab =\r\nexperiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apart f=\r\nrom certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too.  However th=\r\ne lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sak=\r\nti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti=\r\n). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from=\r\n further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless det=\r\nails here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sin=\r\nce we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within =\r\nthe larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the=\r\n Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas com=\r\nprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are full-=\r\nfledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and =\r\nTarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadh=\r\nana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayan=\r\nas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familia=\r\nr with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Ta=\r\nra Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sa=\r\ndhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes A=\r\ngni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invo=\r\nkes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journe=\r\ny. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particul=\r\nar set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initi=\r\nation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiri=\r\ntual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an =\r\nINVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Ea=\r\nch branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till=\r\n the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise i=\r\nt. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is h=\r\neld by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit =\r\nnecessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. I=\r\nmagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of l=\r\nive wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent pract=\r\nice all the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light (Prak=\r\nasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; \n&gt; As already stated =\r\nSakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness thr=\r\nough an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, B=\r\nhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly c=\r\nomprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the man=\r\ny in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. H=\r\nowever it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads=\r\n. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. T=\r\nhe question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramar=\r\nga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore=\r\n the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I ha=\r\nve covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined t=\r\no the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powe=\r\nrful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, t=\r\nhe crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself pro=\r\nclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second=\r\n, saying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (1=\r\n0.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on=\r\n the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate t=\r\no read in English or any other regional language is because understanding t=\r\nhe meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly re=\r\nads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of th=\r\ne writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart fr=\r\nom its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equall=\r\ny regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In=\r\n that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are e=\r\nqually possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM=\r\n*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightawa=\r\ny identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the wors=\r\nhip of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a=\r\n one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just =\r\nas some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sa=\r\ndhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to =\r\nthe Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this=\r\n particular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initi=\r\nation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichar=\r\na, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach=\r\n of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not req=\r\nuired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual=\r\n/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Cha=\r\nndi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditio=\r\nns of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various p=\r\narts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and he=\r\nnce the importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or S=\r\nri Vidya.\n&gt; \n&gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of t=\r\nhe merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Isw=\r\narapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are=\r\n all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude e=\r\ntc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practiti=\r\noners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in sp=\r\niritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA in=\r\nvolves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer t=\r\no the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally one last word. Irresp=\r\nective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effecti=\r\nve methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed=\r\n by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a=\r\n language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIR=\r\nST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (th=\r\nough not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and =\r\nsatsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. =\r\nSri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, liste=\r\nning to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger=\r\n days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  made a quantum leap in the=\r\nir spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrit=\r\ntinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who complain about t=\r\nhe scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; QUO=\r\nTE  // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no goo=\r\nd Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of s=\r\nupply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at onc=\r\ne. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you wil=\r\nl find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your =\r\nmind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for highe=\r\nr divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly talk=\r\ns. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. A=\r\nnd yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deser=\r\nving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of=\r\n blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and elevate yo=\r\nu to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get ho=\r\nld of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers are=\r\n few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also br=\r\ning a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot;  //UNQUOTE=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. =\r\nConducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsa=\r\nngha though not comparable to the actual company of the great masters. By s=\r\nwadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the=\r\n lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening an=\r\nd/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant r=\r\nemembrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and s=\r\nincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI may not interact regularly or reply at least for a while. However I might=\r\n participate in some discussions on and off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Satya Prakash\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I read this message of respected=\r\n Narasimha Garu few times.

I am reproducing this again below. fo=\r\nr me i am completely satisfied with simple but very effective defination. i=\r\n would draw attention of members to following paragraph again:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam=\r\n, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not=\r\n know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any material=\r\n results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will=\r\n accept whatever god gives.

Similarly, a guru with =\r\nsome achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However=\r\n, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account with=\r\n a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similar=\r\nly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and bui=\r\nld one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as =\r\na formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahe=\r\nad and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purpose=\r\ns - (i) for getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasi=\r\nng surrender and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation=\r\n is not that important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a g=\r\nuru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do=\r\n (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as=\r\n Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing s=\r\nurrender, getting whatever material results god wants to give and making sp=\r\niritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* ma=\r\nterial results (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Natu=\r\nre will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals.=\r\n But, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam=\r\n, do it  with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do no=\r\nt know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any materia=\r\nl results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I wil=\r\nl accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender a=\r\nnd make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required.=\r\n That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give=\r\n good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give resu=\r\nlts fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. =\r\nImagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throw=\r\ning them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. =\r\nIf the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fr=\r\nuits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do =\r\nit fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But t=\r\nhe good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Simil=\r\narly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad =\r\nfruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There ma=\r\ny be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may ta=\r\nke more time to get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A=\r\n fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more sp=\r\nillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, rememb=\r\ner that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own acti=\r\nons. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten fruits b=\r\nefore eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take =\r\nsome of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities=\r\n such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made man=\r\ndatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you re=\r\nalize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad resu=\r\nlts occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and t=\r\nhe deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, sti=\r\nck to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in =\r\ntheir life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some pe=\r\nople who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 =\r\nyears back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I kn=\r\now that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienced some thing=\r\ns too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierc=\r\ne aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age =\r\nof ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that sp=\r\niritual progress is important, is looking for god and is attracted to a spe=\r\ncific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some go=\r\nod karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. =\r\nPrevious life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you ha=\r\nve a good understanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do=\r\n something, how to do it, what is more important and what is less important=\r\n, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Films that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal op=\r\ninion that Strong and long standing urge should be considered as Initiation=\r\n at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi =\r\npaatha regularly but was not able to almost for a year. He didnt have forma=\r\nl Guru then but he started oneday on regular basis without any initiation. =\r\nlater he ispired few people to start reading CP.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one loo=\r\nks at this group, many have started CP and homam just by positive influence=\r\ns and no formal initiation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are probably very right in =\r\nyour assumption when you say Adhikara to recite CP may be sprung up due to =\r\nChandi is Ugraatiugra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Chandi is also Mother and t=\r\nhough she may be Ugraatiugra, she is also Sumyaatisaumya. In this age of Ka=\r\nli, She has become the later and she&#39;ll be happy if someone just prays with=\r\n *slightest* of devotion to her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. this =\r\nis a strong conviction developed in me.
