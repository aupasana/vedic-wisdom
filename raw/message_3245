Now=\r\n if the question arises what is &gt;Dharma, I would request going back to the =\r\nmails of Narasmiha on &gt;Dharma, because no one has \n&gt; Let me clear few thing=\r\ns explicitly. We are confusing and Mixing different things here. I am takin=\r\ng &#39;Ahimsa&#39; in the context of Food habits/preferences and Hinsa involved in =\r\nthat. Hinsa (Injury/Killing) involved in that is quite different than say f=\r\nor instance, Injury and killing involved in Military Wars.\n&gt; If a Tiger is =\r\nattacking human societies every now and then and killing people then it is =\r\nrequired to be captured or Killed. That Hinsa is different.\n&gt; So now if we =\r\ntalk about Swa-Dharma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or Collective societ=\r\ny Dharma or Rashtra Dharma, The Killing which happens during Military war c=\r\nan fall in Swa-Dharma of a soldier who kills solders of the other side. It =\r\ncan be called Dharma of Group of people (Society) to kill a Man eater Tiger=\r\n.\n&gt; What i am referring to again and again is the Killing involved for the =\r\nreason of Food habits and THAT is what which can not fall under Swa-Dharma =\r\nof people eating meat. Its possible that the karma of people working in But=\r\nchery shops may not be that heavier then the people who eat meat.\n&gt; In my o=\r\npinion, references to Swadharma is not proper here.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; It is also corr=\r\nect that Most have cravings for the palate. Vegetarian people also have cra=\r\nvings for Spicy, Hot, Sweet, etc.. food. The Major difference however is th=\r\nat Craving for the Veg food is far better in comparison because craving for=\r\n a Chicken or Mutton amounts directly to a loss of life.\n&gt; Again, I think t=\r\nhat it is not required to go in to philosophical discussions here.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; =\r\nI understand that people are born with the Karma baggage of past lives. the=\r\ny will get the culture, family background, habits etc... due to that. Menta=\r\nl conditioning will vary. BUT if a person comes to know about certain thing=\r\ns then it is no use blaming or taking shelter under the circumstances. His/=\r\nher will is always there. Discrimination is always there. I dare give an ad=\r\nvise here. if somebody wants to change Habits which one feel to be disastro=\r\nus, one can try as much possible (Like Rajarshi tried for 108 days) and at =\r\nthe same time surrender to God. pray every day to almighty to help and over=\r\n a period of time, help will come. will surely come.\n&gt; I do not boast or ta=\r\nke any pride in eating Vegetarian food and=C2=A0my intentions are never to =\r\ninsult the people who eat meat.

I do not also claim that Pure veggies are all and always *Go=\r\nod* people.=C3=82=C2=A0 Infact, i have a couple of very good friends who ar=\r\ne meat eater and they are really good human beings. =C3=82=C2=A0I only say =\r\nthat the people who eat meat are not doing the right Karma because the act =\r\nresults in to cold blooded\n&gt;  killing/ butchering / massacre\n&gt; &gt; of innocen=\r\nt Creatures.

Dharma (Non Violence=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally vegetari=\r\nan food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, or else i=\r\nt conflicts with your system badly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, Saadhana or No S=\r\naadhana, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing for fil=\r\nling stomach is if Not right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not right in all con=\r\nditions*. it is a different matter, if in future i succumb to challanging c=\r\nonditions and start eating meat but even then it&#39;ll not justify and make it=\r\n proper thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get =\r\noffended by my message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yo=\r\nur second Para and some writings in your earlier message gives me impressio=\r\nn that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not ap=\r\npeal me. to be very honest. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eatin=\r\ng popular meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. wi=\r\nth that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroa=\r\nches are perfectly alright. even people who have started eating human flesh=\r\n are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinki=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to m=\r\nake quality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of=\r\n already dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover u=\r\np.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase the=\r\ny hate killing invloved.

No. All I am sayi=\r\nng is that,=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 this logic that many vegetarian =\r\npeople provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eating non-veg, d=\r\noes not hold good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I p=\r\nersonally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its=\r\n pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutti=\r\nng of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of s=\r\no cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the =\r\nhumans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which =\r\ncomes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t ha=\r\nve proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). a=\r\nnd then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand a=\r\nnd appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me cru=\r\nel hearted. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the =\r\nquestion of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. =\r\nIt is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained abo=\r\nut may not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=\r\n=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel w=\r\nhere they showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My fri=\r\nends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a =\r\nfish, what is wrong=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 if someone eats an insec=\r\nt. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a cer=\r\ntain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to =\r\nmust be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be bor=\r\nn in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slightes=\r\nt doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own condit=\r\nions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we thin=\r\nk our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and there=\r\nfore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nat=\r\nure has created the world diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-pa=\r\ntra. A person\n&gt;  who is\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets=\r\n born in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid =\r\nwhile eating the same. I know=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 people who fai=\r\nnt at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations =\r\ndaily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for a=\r\nn individual, but it=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 cannot be=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 a universal logic applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=\r\n&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling this is th=\r\ne idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly kil=\r\nling an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys d=\r\nead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if s=\r\nomeone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 does not want to d=\r\neal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amoun=\r\nt of karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easi=\r\nly handled.=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 It is similar to the one you wou=\r\nld get for buying some simple daal which has come to the market through the=\r\n hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. =\r\nThere is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoid=\r\nable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. The=\r\ny are designed to be eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot l=\r\nike dead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming\n&gt;  that? God\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n knows.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An average non=\r\n-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. Hi=\r\ns staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent n=\r\non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People=\r\n who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are pr=\r\none to serious heath issues at a younger age.
