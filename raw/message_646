Was he satisfied? How did he feel \n&gt; &gt; after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthat?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle =\r\nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirtual talks?

This is a=\r\nn unbelievable \n&gt; &gt; experience \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I ha=\r\nve not added anything from my own. I am \n&gt; &gt; &gt; writing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you ar=\r\ne in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working a=\r\ns telegraphist at Okha Port Post office \n&gt; &gt; &gt; near \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; allowance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telepho=\r\nne exchange just opposite \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and due =\r\nto same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Mr. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staun=\r\nch devotee \n&gt; of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev.=\r\n Whenever I was meeting him he was always \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abo=\r\nut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was si=\r\nnging devotional songs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him a=\r\nnd was weeping while singing. He was reading \n&gt; Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ka=\r\nthamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr=\r\n. Patel \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go=\r\n to seashore daily at 7 pm after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; duty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at =\r\nsea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is \n&gt; remembering \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to c=\r\nall me. I shall have to go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call \n&gt; him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nlane \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I wa=\r\ns very much \n&gt; impressed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He =\r\ncould foresee the events. One day I had to go to \n&gt; Dwarka \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Bus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus=\r\n tire will be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus st=\r\nation but bus did not come from Dwarka as \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incide=\r\nnts made me to believe that he had some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; super \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nttracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be =\r\ndisciple \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It wa=\r\ns 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nprayed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as =\r\nhis follower and \n&gt; &gt; bestow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at \n&gt; 6.10 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mo=\r\nrning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am=\r\n I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told =\r\nto my wife in the morning that \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Sh=\r\nri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; annoyed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=\r\n=9CWhy should you take such \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at \n&gt; &gt; Calcutta.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru shou=\r\nld be living one, who can \n&gt; &gt; guide \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sharma=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=\r\n=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people i=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; general \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thak=\r\nur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I \n&gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tel=\r\nling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife =\r\nthat \n&gt; =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Patel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ha=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He \n&gt; h=\r\nas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living.
