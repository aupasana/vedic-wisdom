I =\r\nhave some perspective on this too.\n\nWhen a person does more spiritual sadha=\r\nna, they loose interest in\ntheir looks and start growing hairs and beard. T=\r\nhis in general make \nthem less attractive, offcourse in the west people get=\r\n attracted to \nlong hairs and beard.\n\nNow who is able to grow long beard an=\r\nd a long hair by nature. You will \nfind many few, what I mean here is, by l=\r\niking and not by force or any \nreligoius restrictions.\n\nOnly those who have=\r\n better control on their senses naturally grow their \nhair or beards or tho=\r\nse in the past have done some sadhana which led \nthem to grow the hair and =\r\nbeard. Those sanskars are still present with \nthem in their future lives.\n\n=\r\nThe Hippys are those folks,they may have done some sadhanas in their \nprevi=\r\nous life and hence in this life like long hairs, beard etc.\n\nNot everybody =\r\nlike to grow both hair and beard or even if they like it \nthey donot suceed=\r\n all the time, also in a similar way only a few can \nseat in one place for =\r\na long period of time i.e. 6 or 8 hours. \n\nThese are some side effects of m=\r\naking progress in spirituality. \nOffcourse there are many fakes too these d=\r\nays, but in general all these \nthings like long hairs, long beard, or sitti=\r\nng for a long period of \ntime in a place etc. are somethings that accompany=\r\n a sadhak after some \nprogress. One need not get entangled in these types o=\r\nf things as they \nalso can be very instrumental in blocking one&#39;s progress\n=\r\n\n\nOther way of looking at this is both long hairs and beard provide \nprotec=\r\ntion from rough cold weather and also protect in other ways.\n\nBest Regards\n=\r\nMitesh\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any significance of having long hair and beard in the=\r\n \n&gt; spiritual sadhana? we typically see lot of sadhus having long beard \nan=\r\nd \n&gt; hair, also some households who does some spiritual sadhana emulate \n&gt; =\r\nthat. I understand these as the external signs, but this has been an \n&gt; age=\r\n old practise to have long hair for the spiritual sadhakas, please \n&gt; throw=\r\n some light on this topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank and warm regards\n&gt; Krishna Kanth\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
