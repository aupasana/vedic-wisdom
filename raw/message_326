What can be done to protect =\r\nour frontiers? \n&gt; &gt; Haven&#39;t we always had our hearts and doors open to all?=\r\n  It feels\n&gt; &gt; like Bharat  Mata&#39;s head and hands being injured!\n&gt; \n&gt; with =\r\nthe oldest party being headed by a foreigner for the last ten\n&gt; years, Indi=\r\na will further shrink. Let Indians (Hindus) awake,\n&gt; arise, fight till the =\r\ngoal is achieved.\n \nNations always go through cycles of expansion and shrin=\r\nking. Just like individual beings cannot escape from the cycle of life and =\r\ndeath and the cycle of happiness and sadness, so can&#39;t nation escape from t=\r\nhe cycle of expansion and shrinking and the cycle of prosperity and adversi=\r\nty. The only difference is that the periods are much longer in the case of =\r\nnations.\n \nWhat is more alarming than the *nation* of *India* shrinking is =\r\nthat Hinduism or sanatana dharma is shrinking in the world. Though probably=\r\n there are more Hindus in the world today than a few hundred years back, th=\r\nere are fewer people who truly stick to sanatana dharma today than a few hu=\r\nndred years back. *That* is the real concern.\n \nNow, how do you solve this =\r\nproblem? As the gentleman below says, you can &quot;awake, arise and fight till =\r\nthe goal is achieved&quot;. But, I want to point out that there are different fr=\r\nontiers fighting at different levels in each &quot;fight&quot;. Because the list &quot;siv=\r\nacharya&quot; contains many priests, I want to point out the role that can be pl=\r\nayed by spiritual people and yogis in a dharmic battle (dharma yuddha).\n \nL=\r\net me use the example of Shivaji to illustrate my point. Those who think th=\r\ne military victories of Shivaji were only due to his bravery and tactical b=\r\nrilliance are missing a very key enabling factor. The sadhana of Samartha R=\r\namadas, the great yogi who was his guru, was not any less factor than Shiva=\r\nji&#39;s bravery.\n \nIf you become like Samartha Ramadas, a Shivaji will automat=\r\nically come and lead a fight. Brave soldiers will automatically come and jo=\r\nin that Shivaji. As Krishna says in BhagavadGeetha, everybody has to follow=\r\n &quot;own dharma&quot;. A Brahmana can follow his own dharma and make a big differen=\r\nce in a fight in a totally invisible fashion. If one does spiritual sadhana=\r\n with a specific sankalpa to increase dharma in the world, it is bound to m=\r\nake a difference sooner or later.\n \nSpecifically, if a handful of people st=\r\nart performing Chandi homam twice a day in various parts of the world, with=\r\n the specific sankalpa of establishing sanatana dharma in the world (and wi=\r\nthout *diluting* it by adding any other individual sankalpas), I am confide=\r\nnt that world will change. I have no doubt. The key would be for each perso=\r\nn to pick a place and do homam in the morning and evening in the *same* pla=\r\nce (as opposed to roaming around and doing in different places) and do it a=\r\nround the same times every morning and evening. If three homas can be perfo=\r\nrmed everyday, that will be even better. On the other side, if two cannot b=\r\ne performed and only one can be performed everyday, that can also be useful=\r\n.\n \nThe opulence of the materials burnt in the homam hardly matters. She do=\r\nes not distinguish between a small cotton cloth and an opulent silk saree. =\r\nWe, ordinary people, differentiate. For Her, everything is the same - both =\r\nare clothes. Materials that one can afford can be used. If one is performin=\r\ng a selfish ritual for *individual* good (of a person or a family or a comm=\r\nunity or a nation etc), then materials commensurate with the goal are requi=\r\nred. But, if one is performing a selfless ritual for increasing dharma in t=\r\nhe world, restrictions are fewer and materials matter little.\n \nIf the shlo=\r\nkas are chanted with pure devotion and sincerity and with the perfect faith=\r\n that She is coming in the fire and receiving them, that is enough. If She =\r\nis treated with respect, love and care while She is in fire, that is enough=\r\n. Material deficiencies can be ignored. Even if they do an imperfect job, t=\r\nhe Mother makes it complete and perfect and accepts it! That faith has to b=\r\ne complete. In fact, She *wants* people to do this, so that She can destroy=\r\n adharma in the world. But the nature of certain times is such that people =\r\ndo not do this. When the time to reduce adharma comes, She motivates some p=\r\neople to do this, they do it and then She acts on it. Though She is the one=\r\n who is inspiring some to do this, She needs them to act further. Fortunate=\r\n are those who get to play a role in this fascinating game with their belov=\r\ned Mother.\n \nAs the 12th adhyaya of saptashati says, &quot;durvruttaanaam asesha=\r\nanaam balahaanikaram param rakshobhootapisaachaanaam pathanaadeva naasanam&quot;=\r\n (a mere reading of this reduces the strength of the many with a mean condu=\r\nct and destroys demons and evil spirits).\n \nFor establishing sanatana dharm=\r\na in the world, there is nothing better than a regular practice of Chandi h=\r\nomam. Even Lord Rama performed it before battling Ravana.\n \nIf anybody real=\r\nly has the time, energy and material resources to perform a Chandi homam on=\r\ne or two or three times everyday without any individual wishes but just for=\r\n increasing dharma in the world, I can give them a sankalpa (in Sanskrit) t=\r\nhat they can take at the beginning. I can also privately teach a simple and=\r\n short procedure using which Chandi homam can be performed within 2 hours w=\r\nith some practice. Of course, most people on &quot;sivacharya&quot; yahoogroup may al=\r\nready be proficient in Chandi homam. I am talking about others.\n \nBest rega=\r\nrds,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Radhakrishnan Jambuna=\r\ntha \n  To: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, June 28, 2008 11:4=\r\n2 PM\n  Subject: Re: [sivacharya] Fwd: India Slowly Disappearing...\n\n       =\r\n with the oldest party being headed by a foreigner for the last ten years, =\r\nIndia will further shrink.
