Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 \nhours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday. It is like \nfasting everyday and eating a 30-course meal once every few months vs eating \ndal and rice everyday.\n\nHowever, your request is good and I will try to create a long procedure \nmanual atleast for Mahaganapathi homam.\n\n(2) I have all of them in mind. Purusha sookta homam is the simplest homam \nand very useful for spiritual progress. I do have that in mind. Sudarsana \nhomam can also be done on a regular basis quickly. But navagraha homam is \nmore time-consuming. I will eventually put all of them up.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 01, 2009 6:10 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Query related to Maha Ganapathi Homam\n\n\n&gt; Namaskaram PVR Narasimha Raoji,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a big fan of the Maha Ganapathi Homam and I have seen it being \n&gt; performed at our home as a kid many times. I always wanted to perform this \n&gt; homam on my own and after seeing your video and the Laghu padhati document \n&gt; I am sure I can do it myself. I have couple of requests from my side:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Is it possible to create a document for the full fledged Ganapathi \n&gt; homam ? This will be immensely helpful for people who have the time and \n&gt; intrest to perform such a homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) There are some other important homams particularly the following in \n&gt; which I am deeply intrested :\n&gt; a) Sudarshana Homam\n&gt; b) Navagraha Homam\n&gt; c) Purusha Suktha Homam\n&gt;\n&gt; I would request you to kindly create documents similar to the Maha \n&gt; Ganapathi Homam PDF so that the larger population is benefited.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Sharanam.\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Girish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
