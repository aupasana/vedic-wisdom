These questions were not dire=\r\ncted to me. Nor i know answers to these technicals. I just wanted to share =\r\nan interesting incidence.\n\nThree days back a patient came to me to take tre=\r\natment for fever. He is an old diabetic, hypertensive and have deranged ren=\r\nal functions.\n\nI prescribed him medicines. Two days back he came back. he s=\r\ntill had fever. When i asked why he didn&#39;t took medicines he answered &quot;I di=\r\ndn&#39;t knew whether these medicines are compatible with medicines i am alread=\r\ny taking&quot;\n\nI assured him that i knew about his ongoing medicines and medici=\r\nnes i prescribed are fully in accordance to earlier treatment and he should=\r\n take the medicine.\n\nYesterday he came back. He still had fever. When i ask=\r\ned why he didn&#39;t took medicines he answered &quot;I am not sure that these medic=\r\nines are safe for  my kidneys or not as these are secreted by kidneys also.=\r\n i read on internet&quot; I assured him that they are safe as these medicines ar=\r\ne secreted by liver and only very small fraction is secreted from kidneys w=\r\nhich are negligible and he should take the medicine other wise fever will n=\r\not be cured.\n\nToday he came again. He still had fever. When iasked why he d=\r\nidnt took medicines he answered &quot;i was not sure that these medicines will c=\r\nause acidity or not&quot;\n\nI told him that all the medicines for fever can cause=\r\n acidity but it is not necessary for every patient. it differs from patient=\r\n to patient. Whether they cause acidity or not to you You will get to know =\r\nonly if you take them. Because proof of pudding is in eating.\n\nPlease tell =\r\nme what to do if he comes back tomorrow without taking medicines. Anyone pl=\r\nease help.\n\nThanks in anticipation\n\nAtul\n\n\n"}}
