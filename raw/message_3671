I was also thinking that.\n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple \n&gt; diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in eating \n&gt; fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on \n&gt; the� life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man \n&gt; came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna \n&gt; said first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. � Also a \n&gt; similar examples was quoted to me from� the life of Ma Sarada where - a \n&gt; certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish \n&gt; eating and rather just focus mind on God.\n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; When I tried to reason with them that if these people were to come \n&gt; back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - \n&gt; considering the state of the world today - I�  was catergorically told \n&gt; they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish \n&gt; they would have told right then.� \n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; Then I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual \n&gt; cases, to which I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of \n&gt; such examples even today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West \n&gt; Bengal eat and serve fish. This statement is a fact. I� have had fish \n&gt; meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Missions across� West Bengal.� So, I \n&gt; was told, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of \n&gt; Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary people.\n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; I could make no further arguments and of course had a harrowing time \n&gt; at home trying to convince my parents that I have quit non veg food.\n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; A lot of Bengalis may not have been able to implement the basic \n&gt; teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, however they faithfully follow \n&gt; fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Thakur&quot; and &quot;Sri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.\n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; -Regards\n&gt;  &gt; � Rajarshi\n&gt;  &gt; � \n&gt;  &gt; PS: No disrespect to anyone.

He says (and \n&gt; Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated \n&gt; (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.\n&gt;  &gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is \n&gt; multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely \n&gt; important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Important information about Vimalananda which I came to know only \n&gt; yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single \n&gt; day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day \n&gt; of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; \n&gt; frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because \n&gt; as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting \n&gt; coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also \n&gt; note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all \n&gt; his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions \n&gt; you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are \n&gt; thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). \n&gt; When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or \n&gt; Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to \n&gt; forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of \n&gt; spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many things in \n&gt; the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to \n&gt; universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are \n&gt; `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say \n&gt; that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, \n&gt; they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific \n&gt; purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they \n&gt; know complete background behind their each action and\n&gt;  &gt; moreover their self identification is missing from the action and \n&gt; hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special \n&gt; purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt;  &gt; Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is \n&gt; very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning \n&gt; within him which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction \n&gt; does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually \n&gt; troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.\n&gt;  &gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have \n&gt; some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to \n&gt; comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might be \n&gt; removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he \n&gt; can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate \n&gt; their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is \n&gt; also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced \n&gt; Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible \n&gt; that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by \n&gt; consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons \n&gt; for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only \n&gt; Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda \n&gt; saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India \n&gt; and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n&gt;  &gt; years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately \n&gt; told him to stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept \n&gt; him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is \n&gt; not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup \n&gt; as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and \n&gt; after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda \n&gt; which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self \n&gt; deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami \n&gt; Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami \n&gt; Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self \n&gt; identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Utpal\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Â� \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!Â� I was about to ask this question \n&gt; today on Non-Veg eating.Â�  It is clear from the below passage meat \n&gt; eating is not advisable for anyone.Â� \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I wasÂ� reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in \n&gt; Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat \n&gt; when he was living in USA also relished it.

That is why you find a \n&gt; meat-eater reborn either as a predator or prey or as both in succession. \n&gt; Human beings cry a lot at funerals of their own kind but they have \n&gt; absolutely no thought for the sufferings of the animals they slaughter. \n&gt; They never hesitate to kill and eat. Just think, first they kill the \n&gt; chicken. Often they will cut its throat and let it bleed to death, which \n&gt; is a most painful way to die. Then it will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, \n&gt; and if it happens to be tough everyone will curse it for not satisfying \n&gt; their palates. How many humans would give beautiful tender lean meat if \n&gt; they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too love their \n&gt; children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her \n&gt; chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of \n&gt; motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the \n&gt; slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and \n&gt; nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they \n&gt; cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own children being murdered \n&gt; before their own eyes?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose \n&gt; intellect is subtle enough to self-identify with another being of a \n&gt; different species and experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has \n&gt; no alternative but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have \n&gt; tortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut \n&gt; your throat in this birth you have every right to cut mine in the next \n&gt; or some succeeding birth. Experience is the best teacher and a fool will \n&gt; learn from no other.&quot;Â� \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.
