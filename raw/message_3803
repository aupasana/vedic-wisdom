Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n\nMr. FL can have many opti=\r\nons to react in the situations:\n\n1] Thinking constantly and repenting for t=\r\nhe act He can-\nCurse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stre=\r\nss, resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and=\r\n external activities concerning that issue.\n\nIn this case, He strongly iden=\r\ntifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc.=\r\n..\n\nOR\n\n2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the implem=\r\nentation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a =\r\nRina which needed to be paid back and practically starts training the mind =\r\nwith that knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude of d=\r\netachment. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is extremely=\r\n concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it =\r\nwas a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they wer=\r\ne Money of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come back, she =\r\nwill do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they =\r\nwill not come back.\n\nWith the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Cre=\r\nate New Rinas and will be able to break free from this particular chain. He=\r\n may have successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n\nWith the first Approach, Mr. FL=\r\n has identified himself very strongly with Money and its ownership and henc=\r\ne all the actions done due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which =\r\nwill be needed to settled on a later date.\n\nHowever I am not sure for what =\r\nI have written.

It is n=\r\normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora=\r\n means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure=\r\n and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus the t=\r\nhinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead of impermane=\r\nnt manifestations of god.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; When someone dies, north Indians=\r\n chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. =\r\nIt means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illu=\r\nsion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and death are just a tempora=\r\nry illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is: why should we r=\r\nemind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someone=\r\n praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and we are about to f=\r\neel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This th=\r\ning we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. =\r\nLet the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to s=\r\nomething beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam =\r\nsatya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things that seem not s=\r\no beautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind no=\r\nt dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n&gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and w=\r\ne are about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya=\r\n hai. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the =\r\nmind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; A true Aghora&#39;s m=\r\nind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent=\r\n manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them=\r\n as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attracti=\r\non/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he take=\r\ns it to extremes.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An ag=\r\nhora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusi=\r\nons and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions wh=\r\ny he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eat=\r\nen.=C3=82=C2=A0But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point=\r\n. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an imperman=\r\nent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For exampl=\r\ne, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is=\r\n dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating i=\r\nt. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelli=\r\nng on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will n=\r\not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is =\r\neating Self.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notio=\r\nns really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean =\r\n&quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely=\r\n be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his m=\r\nind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;=\r\na badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from=\r\n the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, a vedantin and a=\r\nn aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that tr=\r\nuth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an ext=\r\nreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experience. That ca=\r\nn in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the =\r\ncase of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am con=\r\nsuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from f=\r\nailing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind =\r\ndwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, wh=\r\nat is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self =\r\nand dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact =\r\nthat failure results in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive =\r\nin succeeding quickly.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; However, difficult tasks cannot nec=\r\nessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not ev=\r\neryone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone i=\r\ns doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness f=\r\nor sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in=\r\n the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana=\r\n.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep t=\r\nhe mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming=\r\n such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. E=\r\nven if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fasc=\r\nination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to ove=\r\nrcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; An agho=\r\nra will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove=\r\n fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two diffe=\r\nrent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them into o=\r\nne without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits nake=\r\nd with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the=\r\n beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sad=\r\nhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that f=\r\nor several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no lo=\r\nnger feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillat=\r\nion. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken do=\r\nwn. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke though=\r\nts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to =\r\nsex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser\n and\n&gt; denser tho=\r\nughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the=\r\n mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditation while s=\r\nitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedn=\r\ness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and w=\r\neakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Mind has a lot of con=\r\nditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Ag=\r\nhora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in =\r\ncertain practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; However=\r\n, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the per=\r\nson keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex ever=\r\nytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime h=\r\ne sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.=\r\n\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Bottomline is=\r\n that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high st=\r\nakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under t=\r\nhe carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is no=\r\nt applicable to all.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Agho=\r\nra&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in o=\r\nne&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is =\r\ncertainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously=\r\n, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and=\r\n the thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=82=C2=A0Aghora stands for neit=\r\nher thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing th=\r\nrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads =\r\nare the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth int=\r\no one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; BTW, t=\r\nhe following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and expl=\r\nains the basic reality.

I do not know if `Dry=\r\n Intellect&#39; (The one without a certain level of Realization) can ever break=\r\n the code of the karma software.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I would think of responding to our =\r\none query filtering it from all those interconnected and too complicated qu=\r\neries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;And how does one know the fine line between paying debt a=\r\nnd &gt;creating a new one?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Consider this real life example.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;T=\r\nake a case study - Mr. Fool (FL) Landed some Amount of Money to Mr. &#39;Very s=\r\nmart&#39;(VS) on basis of trust and for a pious cause. Now it happened so that =\r\nMr. VS could not repay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives ma=\r\nny excuses and many dates but fails and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. F=\r\nL is under great pressure due to that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mr. FL can have many options =\r\nto react in the situations:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1] Thinking constantly and repenting for=\r\n the act He can-&lt;BR&gt;Curse, Constantly\n follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain unde=\r\nr stress, resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Intern=\r\nal and external activities concerning that issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this case, He s=\r\ntrongly identifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Re=\r\npenting etc...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;OR&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance=\r\n to resort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) a=\r\nnd thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be paid back and practically s=\r\ntarts training the mind with that knowledge. He follows up for the money bu=\r\nt with the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to his family and frie=\r\nnds that he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his=\r\n mind he thinks that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfilled.=\r\n He thinks that they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If they n=\r\needed to come back, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify so=\r\nme past rinas then they will\n not come back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the Second Approac=\r\nh, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be able to break free=\r\n from this particular chain. He may have successfully PAID BACK his debt.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly =\r\nwith Money and its ownership and hence all the actions done due to that, so=\r\n He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settled on a later d=\r\nate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However I am not sure for what I have written. I think nobody c=\r\nan be sure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I h=\r\nave a few basic queries. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; What is the line bet=\r\nween control and gratification?\n Everything, it is said, is a Rna.

The idea is to remind oneself that =\r\nlife and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But=\r\n the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth onl=\r\ny when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing w=\r\ne have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselv=\r\nes &quot;Raama naam satya hai.

His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lor=\r\nd (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, go=\r\nod and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries=\r\n to find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An=\r\n aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant ill=\r\nusions and the only\n permanent reality within them is the Self, he question=\r\ns why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is=\r\n eaten.=C3=82&nbsp;But, please remember that eating feces is not the main p=\r\noint. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impe=\r\nrmanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For ex=\r\nample, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s min=\r\nd is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eati=\r\nng it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dw=\r\nelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and wi=\r\nll not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he=\r\n is eating Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Of course, a vedantin also ha=\r\ns the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which e=\r\nssentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such cha=\r\nnting may merely be a\n ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. =\r\nAs he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;=\r\na tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; et=\r\nc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth=\r\n and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora=\r\n is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very=\r\n bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one =\r\nto transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that=\r\n says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely =\r\nmade food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating=\r\n is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste=\r\n of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the =\r\nmind fails to\n absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be =\r\nso disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual exper=\r\nience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by every=\r\none merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas suc=\r\nceeds.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is d=\r\noing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for =\r\nsex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in th=\r\ne middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy a=\r\nnd keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for\n =\r\novercoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distr=\r\nact one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee tha=\r\nt the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, =\r\nhow to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the=\r\n root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhan=\r\na and sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he m=\r\nay combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppo=\r\nse an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then =\r\ndoes his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He =\r\nmay think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists t=\r\no do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be repr=\r\nogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He\n may =\r\nno longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness a=\r\nnd sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may=\r\n no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any sma=\r\nll thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to d=\r\nenser and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhan=\r\na, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so muc=\r\nh time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thr=\r\nill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, th=\r\ne person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experien=\r\nces and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break dow=\r\nn some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine =\r\nthose structures.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, is this a\n fool-pro=\r\nof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engagin=\r\ng in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for me=\r\nditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner=\r\n), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Bottomline i=\r\ns that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high s=\r\ntakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under =\r\nthe carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is n=\r\not applicable to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what i=\r\ns Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is\n merely a practical way to underst=\r\nand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stake=\r\ns war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel=\r\n aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based o=\r\nn a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attr=\r\nact some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Agh=\r\nora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates ho=\r\nw one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasa=\r\nnt.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analo=\r\ngy for various spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

For=C3=82&nbsp;instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a gr=\r\neat composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyaga=\r\nraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a\n self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kama=\r\nlamba Navavarna Krithis=C3=82&nbsp;mention=C3=82&nbsp; great details about =\r\nall the=C3=82&nbsp;nine avaranas and different forms of the divine mother a=\r\ns one goes through each avarana.=C3=82&nbsp;In the Dhyana Krithi=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;of those, in the very=C3=82&nbsp;first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta k=\r\nalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=C3=82&nbsp;That line tells me that=C3=82&nbsp;even t=\r\nhrough Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, you=\r\nr reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded b=\r\ny layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of re=\r\nading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do du=\r\nring navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the=\r\n saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target.\n &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series book=\r\ns by Dr. Robert Svobodha.
