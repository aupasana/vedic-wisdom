I am completing the last time on the Chaturdasi before the Na=\r\nvaratris begin. During Navaratris I plan to perform Chandi Homam with 700 v=\r\nerses. Currently I am doing Chandi Homam daily with only Durga Sapta Sloki =\r\nbecause I am doing chanting otherwise. Sapta Sati, tough as it seemed in th=\r\ne beginning, became a lot more easier for me to chant now (that was the obj=\r\nective with which I have taken up this 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I =\r\nplan to memorize all that. On this occasion, I have a question for Shri Nar=\r\nasimha Garu. I have come across a writing somewhere on Sapta Sati as to how=\r\n it can be a mantra Sastra. The second verse &quot;SavarniH Soorya TanayOH .....=\r\n&quot; was interpreted to as &quot;Hreem..&quot; beejakshara mantra. Do we have a book tha=\r\nt explains all of the SaptaSati in several contexts, the literal meaning, e=\r\nsoteric meaning, the several mantras that the verses represent etc.? If the=\r\nre is no book like that, I would request Shri PVR to author such a book bec=\r\nause of his deep insights into the subject/language and the advanced sadhak=\r\na that he is! \n\nNagraj      \n\n\n"}}
