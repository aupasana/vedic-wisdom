Narasimh=\r\na is still working as a full time employee\n2. I work close to 10 to 12 hour=\r\ns a day.\nI always gave the excuse of not having enough time. How ever, Nara=\r\nsimha kept telling me if you really want to do some thing, you will find ti=\r\nme for it. We wast quite a bit of our time in activities not too important.=\r\n\n\nFor example, I used (even now to some extent) watch movies online, see cr=\r\nicket matches, read news, watch TV.\n\nIf we perceive doing sadhana is more i=\r\nmportant that these activities, we can cut down from these.\n\nThis is my per=\r\nsonal experience. For 2 years after Narasimha urged me to do Japam regularl=\r\ny, I kept giving excuse that I work too much and not having time. From last=\r\n 3 years I am able to Japam regularly. From 2008 onwards doing Homam.\n\nMy w=\r\nork has been as hectic as it was earlier.
