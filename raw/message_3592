I am an instrument of my guru.\n\nAs the volume increases, I may ha=\r\nve to leave it out some questions unanswered. But remember that sincere que=\r\nstions will always get answers. Nature uses someone or the other as an inst=\r\nrument to answer a sincere seeker&#39;s questions. I am only one of MANY instru=\r\nments Nature has at disposal.\n\n(1) I get up early and do Chandi homam in th=\r\ne morning before going to work. My Chandi homam takes 1.25-1.5 hours. I fin=\r\nish homam and meditation and go to work.\n\nPeople say that they are busy and=\r\n have no time. But people usually have a lot of time and waste a lot of it =\r\nknowingly or unknowingly.\n\n(2) The conventional understanding is that Gayat=\r\nri chhandas has 3 padas with each having 8 aksharas (syllables).\n\nThe word =\r\nchhandas comes from the root &quot;chhad&quot; which means &quot;to cover&quot;. The word &quot;aach=\r\nchhaadana&quot; comes from the same root. Chhandas is a cover for a mantra. At a=\r\n higher level, there is a rhythm that works as a cover for a meaning. When =\r\nyou hear a verse, you first notice a rhythm in it. Under the covering of th=\r\nat rhythm lies a meaning. At a finer level, there are different deities rep=\r\nresented by various aksharas or other forming units of the mantra and they =\r\nserve as a cover for the mantra. Under the covering of those deities repres=\r\nenting those syllables lies the actual mantra and its deity. There are 24 d=\r\neities working as a cover in mantras composed in Gayatri.\n\n(3) What we see =\r\nnow is faaaaar from the peak. When Kali is at peak, nobody will remember or=\r\n know about god at all. People will be completely taken over by sense pleas=\r\nures and become totally immoral. Such a time is still far away.\n\nHowever, d=\r\necline of dharma happened too fast on earth in the last few centuries and e=\r\nspecially decades. Thus, some brakes have to be applied to slow it down arr=\r\nest this decline in dharma. There will be a temporary increase in dharma. A=\r\ngain, adharma will catch up and there will be a rapid decline. When that on=\r\ne goes too far, again there may be some reversal. It may go on like this, i=\r\nnstead of dharma declining at a uniform rate.\n\n(4) I think those books are =\r\nwonderful. The three works I like the most are Yoga Vaasishtham, Jnaneshwar=\r\ni (Bhagavad Gita free translation by Sant Jnaneshwar) and Aghora series. I =\r\nsee them as slightly different perspectives, using different abstractions, =\r\non the same ultimate knowledge.\n\nVimalananda may not be conventional, but h=\r\ne is a person of immense understanding and wisdom.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha=\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n=C2=A0=\r\n Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n\n--- On Tue, 1/26/10, nagraj@sbc=\r\nglobal.net &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: nagraj@... &lt;nagraj_=\r\num@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and other questions to P=\r\nVR\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, January 26, 2010, 3:54 P=\r\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Dear Narasimhagaru, \n\n\n\nI =\r\nreally appreciate your contribution on this forum. It is pretty much that I=\r\n started looking forward for your posts which are filled with so much convi=\r\nction, knowledge of our scriptures and clarity. In the mean-while some more=\r\n questions. Some of these questions were asked previously in different thre=\r\nads on this forum, but probably you didn&#39;t have a chance to look at them, w=\r\nith all the activity that is happening over here. \n\n\n\n1. I understand from =\r\ndifferent messages that you do Chandi Homam everyday. How do you manage to =\r\ndo that? It should be taking at least 2.5 to 3 hours to perform this, right=\r\n? Do you do this in the evenings?\n\n\n\n2. What exactly is Gayatri Chandas? (I=\r\n have asked this previously). I find that Savitru Gayatri Mantra has 24 let=\r\nters, Brihaspati Gayatri has 21 letters (Vrishabham Charshaneenam) , Ganapa=\r\nti Moolamantram (aum Shreem hreem kleem gloum Gam Ganapathim.. ..) having 2=\r\n8 letters. \n\n\n\n3. With only 5000+ years into a length of 432,000 years of K=\r\naliyuga, are we at a point that we can say that Kali is deepening? I shudde=\r\nr to think what would happen when kali really deepens fully, say a few thou=\r\nsand years more from now. \n\n\n\n4. I have really heard great praises on this =\r\nforum on Yogi Vimalananda and read great reviews on the Aghora Series books=\r\n by Dr. Robert Svobodha.
