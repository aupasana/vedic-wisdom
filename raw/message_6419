Nothing but a forest=\r\n of brutes. Sense-happiness is not the goal of humanity. Wisdom is the goal=\r\n of all life. We find that man enjoys his intellect more than an animal enj=\r\noys its senses, and we see that man enjoys his spiritual nature even more t=\r\nhan his rational nature. So the highest wisdom must be this spiritual knowl=\r\nedge. With this knowledge will come bliss. All these things of this world a=\r\nre but the shadows, the manifestations in the third or fourth degree of the=\r\n real Knowledge and Bliss.\n\n\n"}}
