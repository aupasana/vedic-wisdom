Only very higher level beings can \n&gt; att=\r\nain the same. Since the topic of siddhis did come up, Vimalananda&#39;s ability=\r\n \n&gt; to suck up a ton of mercury by Vajroli and bring it out from his hair i=\r\nnfront of \n&gt; someone of Vishudhananda&#39;s spiritual calibre, is not a easy fe=\r\nat. This is not a \n&gt; run-of-the-mill siddhi. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; 3) I never com=\r\npared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with Ramakrishna&#39;s \n&gt; disciples. Th=\r\nat is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My comparisons are always based NOT on \n&gt;=\r\n my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual people. That is why I=\r\n am \n&gt; 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spiritually higher than a Viv=\r\nekananada or \n&gt; an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge them., thats your=\r\n point of view. I on \n&gt; the other hand would rather rely on the clear words=\r\n of Vivekananda and \n&gt; Abhedananda on this matter rather than speculation. =\r\nBoth Vivekananda and \n&gt; Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their Guru a=\r\nnd spiritually far higher \n&gt; than they were. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; 4) Whether Ram=\r\nakrishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda&#39;s scale is \n&gt; merely y=\r\nour speculation. Vimalananda&#39;s books however betray no such speculation. \n&gt;=\r\n I would rather rely on the words of the book. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; 5) In this a=\r\nge everyone likes to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people \n&gt; nam=\r\ne themselves Rishis, and we know it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda \n=\r\n&gt; comparison does not stand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles,=\r\n not \n&gt; even the term Guru. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical =\r\nstudy of the \n&gt; books b) Manish&#39;s words. And I have not found you giving an=\r\ny sound logic for why \n&gt; I should change the same. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; 6) If yo=\r\nu do not want to compare spiritual people, that is perfectly fine. I or \n&gt; =\r\nanyone else is not forcing you. However, that does not mean the world will =\r\nnot \n&gt; do so, specially when the great spiritual people themselves have cle=\r\narly done so \n&gt; on different occassions.

This is a delicate area where many have=\r\n \n&gt; misconceptions and I will try to address them. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 * \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s teaching to Lord Rama is clear i=\r\nn Yoga Vaasishtham. The \n&gt; goal of existence and sadhana is self-realizatio=\r\nn. Siddhis are to be neither \n&gt; specifically sought nor specifically avoide=\r\nd, by a seeker of Self. If Nature \n&gt; gives one some siddhi(s), one should a=\r\nccept them with neither excitement nor \n&gt; disappointment. But one should NO=\r\nT run after them, for they are neither \n&gt; necessary nor sufficient for self=\r\n-realization and liberation. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Vivekananda used the same prin=\r\nciple when Ramakirishna proposed to give his \n&gt; siddhis to Vivekananda. He =\r\nasked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize \n&gt; god. Ramakrishna sa=\r\nid no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, \n&gt; when Ramak=\r\nrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda&#39;s two \n&gt; actio=\r\nns demonstrate Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Let us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is =\r\none&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; sadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different peopl=\r\ne climb the hill from \n&gt; different sides and using different paths. There m=\r\nay be trees with nice fruits \n&gt; on the sides of the road. They are siddhis =\r\nor special abilities. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; If one gets distracted, starts climbi=\r\nng the trees and collecting fruits, one&#39;s \n&gt; journey gets delayed and one m=\r\nay not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha says a \n&gt; seeker of Self does n=\r\not pursue any siddhis. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; But if some fruits fall in one&#39;s lap=\r\n by themselves, one can keep them. \n&gt; Similarly, siddhis that come to one b=\r\ny themselves can be accepted by a seeker of \n&gt; Self. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Now an=\r\n important distinction: \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; There are some trees that are found at=\r\n lower altitudes also, but some really \n&gt; special trees are found at very h=\r\nigh altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it \n&gt; shows that one has climb=\r\ned great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not mean \n&gt; much, but some sid=\r\ndhis are very special and only really elevated sadhakas can \n&gt; obtain them =\r\n(whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates \n&gt; such a=\r\n siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. However, the key is that \n&gt;=\r\n one who climbed the same or more distance may not have that or any other f=\r\nruit. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Unlike in the example o=\r\nf climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual \n&gt; progress in re=\r\nal life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure \n&gt; how m=\r\nuch progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally and \n&gt; =\r\nwhat exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind. We may try to judge it from external fa=\r\nctors \n&gt; such as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Here, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one=\r\n&#39;s siddhis to judge \n&gt; how high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person=\r\n who reached the absolute \n&gt; top may not have any fruits, while one person =\r\nwho still has ways to climb may \n&gt; have gotten some really nice fruit. Usin=\r\ng externaslly demonstrable siddhis that \n&gt; are neither necessary nor suffic=\r\nient for Self-realization as a measure of one&#39;s \n&gt; progress is unsound. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Given that spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it=\r\n and compare \n&gt; people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarva=\r\nantaryaami - a \n&gt; perfected being who has access to each being&#39;s internal s=\r\ntate - can do that. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Rajarshi,=\r\n you are assuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on \n&gt; Vimal=\r\nananda&#39;s scale. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; \n&gt; Ab=\r\nhedananda, Vivekananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and=\r\n \n&gt; hence Vimalananda is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 =\r\nto 2. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Is Paramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex s=\r\ncandal, also a Paramahamsa \n&gt; because he is known so? See, how people are f=\r\namously known may or may not \n&gt; reflect their spiritual stature. Real spiri=\r\ntual stature is internal and you \n&gt; cannot see it. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; We do no=\r\nt know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not be just a \n&gt; param=\r\nahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, but be a siddha or a natha or even a rishi. =\r\n\n&gt; He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some religious exp=\r\nerts of \n&gt; that time declared based on various signs. If Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa is Vishnu \n&gt; himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can definitely be =\r\nrishis or naths in \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s scale. If your argument is that they ca=\r\nnnot be because they did \n&gt; not demonstrate siddhis compatible with that st=\r\natus, that is a non-point as I \n&gt; explained above. The disagreement between=\r\n then boils down a difference in the \n&gt; relevance and importance of externa=\r\nlly demonstrated siddhis. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Why=\r\n this is relevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to=\r\n \n&gt; have misconceptions. The take home for some people from some books desc=\r\nribing \n&gt; miracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; Vasishtha is not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read wh=\r\nat he taught \n&gt; Lord Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda an=\r\nd Upanishad. It will \n&gt; balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yo=\r\nga Vaasishtham. Siddhis are \n&gt; neither necessary nor sufficient for self-re=\r\nalization. Don&#39;t be distracted by \n&gt; them or be infatuated with them. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0 \n&gt; The goal of sadhana is that your notions of &quot;this is I and these=\r\n are mine&quot; get \n&gt; subtler and subtler and hold of six internal enemies on y=\r\nou becomes weaker and \n&gt; weaker. Others may or may not be able to see and j=\r\nudge your progress, but you \n&gt; know your progress and weaknesses the best. =\r\nTHAT is the crux and siddhis have no \n&gt; relevance or meaning. Any fascinati=\r\non for them will set you back in your \n&gt; sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds, \n&gt; Narasimha \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------- \n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings, \n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Ta=\r\nrpana: \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108 \n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------ \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There was a long friendl=\r\ny ;-) exchange between Rajarshi and me on Friday \n&gt; &gt; (July 29) on twitter =\r\non measuring spiritual caliber. This came from the \n&gt; &gt; context of Rajarshi=\r\n&#39;s comments on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (r=\r\negarding their attitude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; &gt; compared them with Vimalan=\r\nanda and said their spiritual caliber was of \n&gt; &gt; the scale of 2, while Vim=\r\nalananda&#39;s was 2 power 16. He also talked about \n&gt; &gt; the hierarchy of spiri=\r\ntual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 \n&gt; &gt; cents of musings on tha=\r\nt. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; Measuring Spiritual Calib=\r\ner \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple =\r\nof days \n&gt; &gt; back on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even com=\r\npare \n&gt; &gt; flowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & s=\r\nay \n&gt; &gt; which is a better flower. They have different properties like color=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; size, shape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; values depend on the purpose and they cannot be quantified universall=\r\ny. \n&gt; &gt; How can any sane person then say that spiritual caliber of differen=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; people can be compared and quanitified? The field of duality has \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi has infinite aspects \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a person as one \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n number and compare them. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before one even attempts to understand =\r\nVimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; Rishi), please not=\r\ne that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; &gt; in scriptures for deities also. Som=\r\ne consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; &gt; where Vishnu is supreme. Some consid=\r\ner a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; &gt; Shiva is supreme. Some consider a hier=\r\narchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; &gt; supreme. And so on. None of them is a=\r\nbsolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; &gt; and for specific purposes, i.e. from=\r\n a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; &gt; people who take them as absolute an=\r\nd argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; &gt; by Vishnu is superior to so and so=\r\n thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; &gt; know that none of the hierarchies =\r\nis absolute. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare =\r\nthe wisdom of \n&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion =\r\nof Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassi=\r\non of Shirdi Sai, \n&gt; &gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of La=\r\nhiri Mahashaya, \n&gt; &gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humil=\r\nity of Eknath \n&gt; &gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Go=\r\npaler Ma, etc, \n&gt; &gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared fr=\r\nom specific \n&gt; &gt; limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superio=\r\nr to all, in \n&gt; &gt; another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramak=\r\nrishna, and so \n&gt; &gt; on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should no=\r\nt even try to. \n&gt; &gt; You should just appreciate them individually and aspire=\r\n to be like any \n&gt; &gt; of them that you like the most. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda&#39;=\r\ns list may be correct from specific perspective. More \n&gt; &gt; importantly, his=\r\n words should make one realize that there is always \n&gt; &gt; scope for further =\r\nself-control (and the resulting mastery over the field \n&gt; &gt; of duality) whi=\r\nle one is still embodied. One should never rest and \n&gt; &gt; aspire for better =\r\nself-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to \n&gt; &gt; judge yogis base=\r\nd on that is unwise. Especially making statements like \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Vimalananda is=\r\n heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and thinking \n&gt; &gt; that something=\r\n is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have \n&gt; &gt; said that (v=\r\ns someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even if Vimalananda&#39;s hier=\r\narchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume \n&gt; &gt; that you can judge the s=\r\ntature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna was popularly know=\r\nn as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; &gt; per Vimalananda&#39;s classific=\r\nation or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; &gt; Or may be a deity? My fr=\r\niend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; &gt; the details we know, =\r\ncan we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; stature based on his o=\r\nwn classification? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each discip=\r\nles of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; &gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably m=\r\nade this statement based on \n&gt; &gt; what you read and heard of Vimalananda. Fo=\r\nr the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; &gt; not even 100% clear whether he was a rea=\r\nl person or an imagined \n&gt; &gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wis=\r\nely!) left the latter \n&gt; &gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book! \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; told Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would=\r\n be \n&gt; &gt; back, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would=\r\n be \n&gt; &gt; one more birth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalanand=\r\na, on \n&gt; &gt; the other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a =\r\nbody was \n&gt; &gt; waiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put to=\r\ngtr&quot;, just \n&gt; &gt; Abhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aga=\r\nin, please note that this is just one definition. One can have many \n&gt; &gt; de=\r\nfinitions. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; &gt; hierarc=\r\nhies and say that &quot;X is weightier than Y and so what he said must \n&gt; &gt; be m=\r\nore correct&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; People with lopsided understanding of scriptures ta=\r\nke relative knowledge \n&gt; &gt; to be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I=\r\n am afraid some people \n&gt; &gt; are doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot;=\r\n such as the Aghora \n&gt; &gt; books. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking somethin=\r\ng as gospel or as \n&gt; &gt; absolute. Written words are always relative and neve=\r\nr absolute. \n&gt; &gt; Discriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first a=\r\nnd hopefully \n&gt; &gt; using experencial realization later on. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; More im=\r\nportantly, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we should \n&gt; &gt; not =\r\ncommit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments of greats \n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\no did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us. \n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards, \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha \n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\now, Ramakrishna himself said that Vivekananda and six other sishyas were \n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Ishwara Koti&quot; or &quot;Nitya Siddhas&quot;. Can you tell me where this falls on \n&gt; =\r\nVimalananda&#39;s scale? What do you think &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (nithya=3Deternal) m=\r\neans? \n&gt; Is it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greater or in between? If six d=\r\nisciples were \n&gt; &quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; as you say, =\r\ncan he be a \n&gt; &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than them?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Si=\r\nmple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came down. An =\r\n\n&gt; amsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of the Rishi&#39;s \n&gt; =\r\nconsciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and once the purpose is=\r\n \n&gt; served, goes back to the source. Similar for=C2=A0the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. =\r\nTherefore, \n&gt; very technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, =\r\na projection of a \n&gt; Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Siddha=\r\ns, Naths, Munis etc are \n&gt; projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is =\r\nkept is ingorance of their real \n&gt; being (Rishi) such that the play can go =\r\non (not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). \n&gt; They are Nitya-siddha because ev=\r\nen if they take birth over and over, being parts \n&gt; of extremely higher bei=\r\nngs, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely \n&gt; eventually go back t=\r\no the source when the work is done. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; However, in their forms as spe=\r\ncific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these \n&gt; amsa attain the specif=\r\nic stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will \n&gt; determine if they ar=\r\ne to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are \n&gt; here for a =\r\npurpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true \n&gt; sense=\r\n is when he, as Vimalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific \n&gt; sha=\r\nktis)=C2=A0an &quot;orbit&quot; and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging in=\r\nto it, \n&gt; deeper and deeper.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There is a book of conversation=\r\ns between Totapuri and a certain sadhaka (his \n&gt; disciple) when Totapuri li=\r\nved in Puri. He used to stay in the Swargadwara \n&gt; smashana and later someo=\r\nne build a small ashram for him. Totapuri&#39;s ashram still \n&gt; exists in Puri.=\r\n In that conversation, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of \n&gt; what is=\r\n a siddha and higher. And how only a Siddha and none less=C2=A0is a true \n&gt;=\r\n Vigyani. He further mentions that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to=C2=\r\n=A0go to the \n&gt; stage of a Siddha. His work was specific, he did the work a=\r\nnd went off. He did \n&gt; not need to and therefore did not=C2=A0become a Sidd=\r\nha. I see zero confusion here.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
