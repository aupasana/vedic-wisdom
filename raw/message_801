I will write more later. But the funny thing is that this is exactly the topic of a project on which Manish and I worked during our India trip in last summer. Manish is busy working on wrapping this project up.\n \n&gt; Regarding, prooving the Mahaabhaarat events with astronomical \n&gt; combination, can hardly be taken as proof because while writing his \n&gt; creation, Maharshi Vyaasa would have taken combination of those \n&gt; times. - this is just another argument by Logical view.\n \nBut the problem is that modern Indologists do not accepe that Vyasa lived 5000 years back and he wrote Mahabharata. They think that Mahabharata was put together in 500 BC - 500 AD timeframe! If astronomy proves that the positions given MB really happened 5000 years back and if that strongly suggests that a person having the ability to observe planets actually wrote MB 5000 years back, it is a very big jolt to the standard views of Indologists.\n \nDefensive and diffident attitude of Hindu historians and their reluctance to view Hindu historical texts as history stems from concerted efforts by biased European Indologists from old times. When time comes, those early works need to be discredited thoroughly and Hindu consciousness needs to be awakened.\n \nI will write more later.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n \n---- utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Prasad Bhai,\n&gt; namaste !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much your very nice response.\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, i belive that krishna was a realiry, with in my heart that is \n&gt; without doubt. It is just, the *head* comes in questioning when some \n&gt; skeptics question about the very existence of Mahabhaarat or \n&gt; Raamaayan. some time it is a sincere query also. some time you think \n&gt; yourself also about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; yes it is &#39;Iti Haas&#39;. &#39;it Happened&#39; and not epic.\n&gt; \n&gt; in case of mahatma Gandhi, I just gave opinion of him but i don&#39;t \n&gt; endorse his view in this matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Su-Yodhan and Su Shaasan - its a revealation for me.i never new \n&gt; this. Thanks but can you give me reference about that and who \n&gt; changed the names? - this will be very good point which has bothered \n&gt; me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding, prooving the Mahaabhaarat events with astronomical \n&gt; combination, can hardly be taken as proof because while writing his \n&gt; creation, Maharshi Vyaasa would have taken combination of those \n&gt; times. - this is just another argument by Logical view.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda, in his work &#39;Shri Krishna & Bhagvad Gita&#39; \n&gt; mentions That whether Shri Kishna was a reality or Not, gita&#39;s \n&gt; message is great. it gives eternal knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve made argument with some people in the past that &quot;if modern \n&gt; History has not recorded the world events does not mean that the \n&gt; existance of human beings was not there on the earth. in other words \n&gt; modern history can never be the only &#39;Pramaan&#39; for judging reality \n&gt; of ancient events and personalities.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally it seems, that it might remain, matter of our heart and \n&gt; beliefs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Utpal ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramayana and Mahabharata are collectively referred as itihAsa in \n&gt; our\n&gt; &gt; tradition. The word itihAsa translates literally to &quot;so it \n&gt; happened&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, please refer to the numerous close attempts at astronomically\n&gt; &gt; dating the Mahabharata by Shri Narahari Achar\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &lt;http://sarasvati96.googlepages.com/reclaimingthechronologyofbharatam\n&gt; %3A&#92;\n&gt; &gt; narahariachar%28july2006%29&gt;  , Shri P V Vartak\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &lt;http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/ancient/mahabharat/mahab_varta\n&gt; k.h&#92;\n&gt; &gt; tml&gt;   etc. that confirms the time period according to internal\n&gt; &gt; references within the epic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And my brief responses to your questions are as follows\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi, the Great Soul he indeed was, wasn&#39;t a scholar \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; Indic traditions and studies (religious, historical etc). He had \n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; nobler tasks to concentrate his energies on. So we need not rely \n&gt; on his\n&gt; &gt; judgement/opinions on these matters\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) The original names were &#39;suyOdhan, sushAsan&#39; etc. The &#39;du&#39; \n&gt; prefix was\n&gt; &gt; substituted after the fact to indicate the negative side of ethics \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; morality these people were.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) This looks just an opinion with no substantiation and hence I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; leave this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Shri Raman&#39;s reasoning is valid but not sufficient (if that is \n&gt; all he\n&gt; &gt; stated and not any more)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) Very true. By extendsion and generalization, if vyAsa was a con\n&gt; &gt; artist, what does he have to benefit from painting a character as \n&gt; God?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6) I don&#39;t think there is any dispute about whether Rama or \n&gt; Krishna were\n&gt; &gt; born. True that there are disputes on their era, divinity etc. but \n&gt; I did\n&gt; &gt; not come across any disputes about their very existence many \n&gt; millenia\n&gt; &gt; ago.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To establish any Truth conclusively, it is not possible by relying \n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; others but by genuinely embarking on the search ourselves and \n&gt; employing\n&gt; &gt; all our faculties towards that. Otherwise, it just remains our\n&gt; &gt; prejudiced choice of which scholar&#39;s opinion to value over other.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; -Prasad\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu & Members,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a long pending question with me and that is Historical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality or otherwise of our many revered personalities/events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take for instance, &#39;Mahabhaarat&#39; & &#39;Shri Krishna&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would try to give some view points gathered from all these \n&gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from various sources and my own thinking as well-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi didn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a reality.he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought that it was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to be \n&gt; unable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) How can parents name their children \n&gt; as &#39;DURYodhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.. i am not sure about the meaning of the names but it implies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something perverted. knwoledgable person in sanskrit can shed \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; light on this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Mahabhaarat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent \n&gt; author,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creation and \n&gt; krsihna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was just a &#39;imaginary&#39; central character of his grand work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; !.....!.....!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Dr. Raman, in Notable Horoscopes has strongly written that \n&gt; Shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna was a historically reality. His reasoning was that an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never Inspire & attract\n&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of people for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic genious then how come he himself features in \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; story? if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but then WHY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll write another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. \n&gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so many Saints \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perticular Form, they could see the same form of the supreme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality...the supreme power can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devotee of that form \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, without devotion & \n&gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they got to see the form of Shri Krushna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts about this? How to conclusively establish the Truth \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this case?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
