The same theme repeats itself over and =\r\nover again in many ways:\n\no Shiva/Shakti\no Prakriti/Purusha\no In astrology =\r\nmantras for planets versus mantras for signs (signs always related to mahav=\r\nidya/devi)\no General literature about male/female gods and their progeny\n\nO=\r\nverall, it seems to me that the idea is one of progressive manifestation (o=\r\nf consciousness/form/individuality). The male is the manifester, the female=\r\n is the field/area in which the manifestation will occur and the progeny (i=\r\nn the cases there is progeny) is the result. The result is always at a prog=\r\nressively more outward level. \n\nI assume this is the idea behind all the ma=\r\nle/female symbolism. Please correct me if this is wrong. However, I still s=\r\ntruggle with what is the result of devi/mahavidya mantra versus the other (=\r\nI assume &quot;male&quot;) mantras. Extending the same concept as above, it would see=\r\nm that the non-devi/non-mahavidya type mantras are the ones that result in =\r\naligning one&#39;s actions with whatever it is that the mantra&#39;s goal is. While=\r\n devi/mahavidya type mantras, in going with same symbolism, would not actua=\r\nlly directly influence one&#39;s actions but would give knowledge of the area o=\r\nf action, and thereby help in making the correct choice when indeed the tim=\r\ne comes for action. This is purely my own conclusion. Is this correct?\n\nAnd=\r\n even so, I still don&#39;t understand why there seems to be a requirement for =\r\nprecision and exactness in devi/mahavidya type sadhana but not in the non-d=\r\nevi type sadhana.\n\nPlease forgive me if I am simplifying things too much. A=\r\nny and all comments are more than welcome, I am simply trying to improve my=\r\n understanding (for now).\n\nSincerely,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n"}}
