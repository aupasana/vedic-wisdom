Curiosity is also a facet of human mind. For starters like us =\r\nit is good to be curious about good things rather than material things. Alt=\r\nhough at advance stage such curiosities are also a hurdle. I agree that we =\r\nshould concentrate on our saadhna instead of thinking about radical things.=\r\n\n\n&gt; This may just be your ego at work.\n\nYes sir, it is most probably. I thi=\r\nnk I need more introspection to know/search about more demons inside me. an=\r\nd pray to Lord Krishna for help in killing them. Such demons arise in me fr=\r\nom time to time. In one form or other. But with grace of Lord Krishna eithe=\r\nr they are killed or run away for some time.\n\nBut for us, it hardly matters=\r\n that whether you are part of their group or not. Because either way, you h=\r\nad changed our lives to great extent. And we are highly thankful to you tel=\r\nling us that &#39;there is gold in the box&#39; and for telling us &#39;how to get the =\r\nkey&#39;.\n\n&gt; we should first get used to recognizing them.\n\nRecognizing such de=\r\nmons is infact difficult part in this process. If we really have wish to ki=\r\nll them, it is comparatively easy. Shumbha and Nishumbha indeed exist in us=\r\n in many many different forms. They are asuras with mayavi powers which hel=\r\np them change their outlook frequently. And this makes more difficult to re=\r\ncognise them. And they are clever enough to take shape of forms which we tr=\r\nain our mind to accept as &#39;good&#39;. Which further confuse us. God help us rec=\r\nognize them by throwing some light inside us by one means or other and then=\r\n sending us needed weapons to kill them by parcel through one messenger or =\r\nother. Saadhak should be thankful to God for help in recognizing the demons=\r\n and for the weapons he send through messenger, as well as to the messenger=\r\n.  \n\nPlease forgive me for mistakes.\n\nKind Regards\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We =\r\nall will like to know about your personal opinion about this.\n&gt; &gt; What do y=\r\nou think that he has taken birth or have yet to take birth?\n&gt; \n&gt; How can an=\r\nyone know for sure? The fact that atleast 4 different \n&gt; spiritual leaders =\r\nclaimed to be his reincarnation clearly shows that \n&gt; this is a difficult a=\r\nrea to infer. Why would my personal opinion be \n&gt; relevant or useful?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWhy is it important anyway? Vishnu is going to come as Kalki. Are we to \n&gt; =\r\nspend time anticipating and speculating about Kalki or are we to worship \n&gt;=\r\n previous incarnations - Narasimha, Rama, Krishna etc - based on our \n&gt; tas=\r\nte?\n&gt; \n&gt; All we can say is that reincarnated Ramakrishna and his people wil=\r\nl \n&gt; execute an important spiritual mission for our times. Exactly what the=\r\ny \n&gt; will do or how they will behave cannot be said.\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, Narasi=\r\nmha, Vamana, Rama and Krishna were drastically \n&gt; different from each other=\r\n. The lila may drastically change from one \n&gt; incarnation to another, but t=\r\nhe purity will remain.\n&gt; \n&gt; This gentleman wrote a detailed mail to me and =\r\nsome things stood out. \n&gt; For example, he wrote: &quot;We have notified, as an a=\r\nct of respect and \n&gt; politeness, the Ramakrishna Mission, and as expected, =\r\nwe were \n&gt; ridiculized and despised.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Krishna did not go to Ayodhya or=\r\n tell people of Ayodhya that he was \n&gt; Rama&#39;s reincarnation. Even with Jamb=\r\navanta, he revealed himself as Rama \n&gt; to Jambavanta only after circumstanc=\r\nes brought them together and they \n&gt; fought a duel for many days (after all=\r\n, that was the boon Jambavanta \n&gt; asked Rama!).\n&gt; \n&gt; If Ramakrishna is real=\r\nly reincarnated, I would not expect him to \n&gt; &quot;notify&quot; Ramakrishna mission.=\r\n He would just execute his new mission and \n&gt; new symbols *may* eventually =\r\nemerge from that new mission. He wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; care about old symbols. After =\r\nall, Ramakrishna himself presumably knew \n&gt; who he was in the very previous=\r\n incarnation, but did not make much ado \n&gt; about it..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; will surely ma=\r\nke waves.\n&gt; \n&gt; He may or may not become famous while alive, but his work wi=\r\nll touch the \n&gt; lives of many spiritual seekers for a few centuries. That m=\r\nuch can be \n&gt; said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I usually think that may be Manish Ji, and you c=\r\nan be part of his \n&gt; &gt; Group.\n&gt; &gt; Well, for a stupid person like me, It is =\r\nanother &#39;wild Guess&#39;  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; This may just be your ego at work. Nature of =\r\nego is to make one feel \n&gt; good about oneself and about people and things a=\r\nssociated with one. You \n&gt; are a member of this yahoogroup for a while, int=\r\neract with us on this \n&gt; yahoogroup and are interested in homam being sprea=\r\nd by us. So your ego \n&gt; may want to think that we are important people.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; If you receive a parcel containing a key to a box full of gold, who \n&gt; de=\r\nlivered the parcel is irrelevant. Your life is made if the key indeed \n&gt; op=\r\nens the box of gold, irrespective of who delivered the parcel. People \n&gt; ca=\r\nn benefit from any spiritual writings or homam manuals here, without \n&gt; put=\r\nting us on a pedestal. As I said earlier, Manish&#39;s clear instruction \n&gt; was=\r\n that we should guard against focusing on personalities and building \n&gt; awe=\r\n and should instead focus on sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ego has two aspects: I-ness and =\r\nmine-ness. Demons Sumbha and Nisumbha in \n&gt; the Chandipath are symbols of t=\r\nhose two qualities in us. Mine-ness \n&gt; extends to many matters in many ways=\r\n. Before we can defeat Sumbha and \n&gt; Nisumbha (within us), we should first =\r\nget used to recognizing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish S=\r\noftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -----=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue,=\r\n Jan 25, 2011 at 2:51 AM, Dr. A.
