However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.\n \nI experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..\n \n*        *        *\n \nIt was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.\n \nManish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to handle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.\n \n*        *        *\n \nA good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.\n \nOne day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.\n \nI noticed on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;\n \nHe was absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement, brought in rajas  and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!\n \nLucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI remember one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would do some important work in this birth.\n \nWhen I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;\n \nHow true and wise!\n \n*        *        *\n \nJust as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and increase detachment.\n \nManish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n \n*        *        *\n \nHomam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.\n \nThe point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start to work together very effectively.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything similar to it), it\n&gt; happens with all beginners and its only practice which makes one\n&gt; perfect. Most of us assume that this is only applicable in mundane\n&gt; matters. This is applicable in the path of spirituality too. I know\n&gt; there are people who think that any affair/process related to God must\n&gt; be done perfectly. Honestly ... unless one is an adept, this is\n&gt; impossible and only repeated and sincere attempts makes one an adept.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reminds me of the great Kalidasa who worshipped Goddess Mahakali for\n&gt; nine lives and he was born a dunce in his tenth and she appeared to\n&gt; him in his 10th lifetime, when his sadhana was complete and he banged\n&gt; his head out of sheer frustration. Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with\n&gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path for most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I also\n&gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Chandi\n&gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!\n&gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then\n&gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on\n&gt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took\n&gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied.  Manishji then\n&gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely\n&gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between\n&gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally\n&gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated in it, but\n&gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which he\n&gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense brains :). I\n&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave up,\n&gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really\n&gt; intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the\n&gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided\n&gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt\n&gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\n&gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for helping\n&gt; me progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We\n&gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very\n&gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.\n&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...\n&gt; plenty of time. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen\n&gt; overnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, that should be\n&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you\n&gt; get or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and\n&gt; move on to higher things. I wish all the best. We should really thank\n&gt; our stars that people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding\n&gt; us ... what would be life without them!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; -Narayan-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

But, if it \n&gt; &gt; does, don&#39;t worry. Re-ignite it as Narayan said, pray to Agni in the \n&gt; &gt; mind and continue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose a servant is asked by his master to carry a vessel of milk \n&gt; &gt; to a place without spilling it on the way. Suppose a little milk is \n&gt; &gt; spilled on the way. What should he do? Should he abandon the project \n&gt; &gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the destination?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutagni being weak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignoring those things and not thinking too \n&gt; &gt; much about the significance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or badly it \n&gt; &gt; went and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve your \n&gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others. \n&gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank and \n&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this \n&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this \n&gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n&gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various physical persons \n&gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try \n&gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries \n&gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote ego \n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar \n&gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in this world and one \n&gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior to \n&gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the world, \n&gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something less \n&gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy and \n&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in light \n&gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job \n&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own nothing. \n&gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Reading your response another question came into my mind. \n&gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;          It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or \n&gt; &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me couple of \n&gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one member \n&gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me,  i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ?

Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           One can repeat mentally while listening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention \n&gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n&gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n&gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n&gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           However, there is a difference between meditation and \n&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it \n&gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some \n&gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent \n&gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the \n&gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and \n&gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru \n&gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the \n&gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n&gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n&gt; &gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The \n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up \n&gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n&gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for \n&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n&gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended \n&gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). \n&gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \n&gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after \n&gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining \n&gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small \n&gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover \n&gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and \n&gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later \n&gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days \n&gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered \n&gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went \n&gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \n&gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam?
