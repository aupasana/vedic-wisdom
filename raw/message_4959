If you are unable to use sesame seeds and use akshatas as a substitute for sesame seeds, it is ok to stick to the same mantra and imagine the akshatas to be sesame seeds. That may be better than changing the text to &quot;akshatodakam&quot;.\n \nSesame seeds, atleast the white ones, are available in most places, including the west.\n \nYou can collect the water in a vessel or bowl and offer it at the base of a plant or tree at the end of the ritual. That is better than leaving it on the floor.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThis fortnight is a fantastic time to do pitri tarpanas. One can do pitri tarpana on everyday during this fortnight and forget all other criteria.\n \nA lot of people these days may benefit from pitri tarpana. The super-short procedure can be finished in 5 minutes and makes a lot of difference over the time. These are some chakras (energy centers) in the palm. When water flows over tham in a particular direction and thoughts of freedom from certain subtle influences on one&#39;s mind are in one&#39;s mind at the same time, it is conducive to internal changes which free one from those influences. Like with all rituals, you are engaging in external actions that promote certain kinds of internal transformation over time. Rituals work over time, when coupled with conducive thinking.\n \nIn the old days, brahmanas (i.e. people interested in knowledge, spiritual progress and liberation) used to do a short homam and pitri tarpana everyday. If that is not possible, atleast doing tarpana during this fortnight is a great idea.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSomeone asked about diet rules etc. For any spiritual sadhaka, eating as saattwik food as one can is always a good idea. While doing sadhanas like pitri tarpana or homam, it is good if one can stop eating meat or atleast cut down on it. Eat as simple and saattwik food as possible.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; I downloaded the Pitri Tarpan Manual 2 days ago and am planning to start it from tomorrow for whole of this Pitri Paksha beginning with super-short procedure.\n&gt; I could not arrange for the seasame seeds altogether. The manual says, go with Akshats in that case. But, while I am offering the water with akshats (ideally seasame seeds) to Pitris in second last section, the mantras use the word &quot;Tilodakam&quot;. If I am right, this refers to the seasame seeds being offered. Is it fine to continue with these mantras only till I find the seasame seeds, or shall I modify it mysylf with say &quot;Akshatodakam&quot;.\n&gt; For today, I will go with as suggested, but it would be nice if you can guide the right way in absence of such things.\n&gt; Also, is it OK to to put a paper sheet and a vessel in front of one, and to leave the akshats and water after the offerings into them, than on tiled floors? And then later put these water and akshats in some garden (or soil), from where they are absorbed into the five elements easily. From fllor it will either be wiped off or will get dried up there to be mopped off later. I think that is not good thing to do.\n&gt; Again for today I will do the same way. Please correct me for the rest of Pitri Paksha.\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,Sriram\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
