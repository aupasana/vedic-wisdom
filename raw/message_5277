I was not a=\r\nble to understand what points you are making so it took time to understand =\r\nwhat you are saying. \n\nsir, below are some words which constitute my thinki=\r\nng. with deep regards i want to share them here with a hope that they may a=\r\nnswer your questions. Please forgive me for my mistakes.\n\n1) Regarding beha=\r\nviour and thinking of Vimlananda and other Rishis, i honestly admit that I =\r\ndo not understand properly why they do what they do. This is because I am n=\r\not able enough to reach that level of intelligence. But when it comes to Vi=\r\nmalananda, when I try to understand why they are doing so, I always refer t=\r\no his saying that he wanted to die with a clean karma account. Here clean m=\r\neans &#39;empty&#39;. \n\nSecond, he usually said that it is best to exist at two lev=\r\nels of conciousness at the same time(Forgive me for wrong words). like when=\r\n he is playing chess with Robert at the same time he is wandering at higher=\r\n level of conciousness, without anyone realising that what he is thinking.\n=\r\n\nSo, i assume that whatever he did was because of above two principles whic=\r\nh he was always aware of. Whether he was interrupting TV Signal or messing =\r\nwith Sadhu at his cave or any other incidence. \n\nAt the end, he gave his li=\r\nfe for saving son of one of his disciples without even letting them know. \n=\r\nI may never be able to understand why Vimalananda did what he did. \n\nWhat I=\r\n think of Vimalananda is that he was a great Soul. Who have some rinanuband=\r\nha left in this world along with some conditioning. so he came to pay them =\r\nand to remove those conditioning. And I think that he has again taken birth=\r\n in this world to repay some more of his left rinanubandha.\n\nI believe Mani=\r\nsh Ji is also a Soul of same caliber and he is one who is nitya siddha soul=\r\n. And he is here to just repay his rinanubandha and to help others evolve.\n=\r\n\nRaman Maharishi used to eat pan daily after every lunch before going on a =\r\nwalk. once his disciple became late for bringing the Paan. Ramana Maharishi=\r\n waited for about 10-15 minutes and when disciple didnt arrived he went on =\r\nhis walk. but after that he never ate Paan. This can be interpreted as his =\r\nego or his realisation that he was attached to Paan so he quit a thing whic=\r\nh he was attached to.\n\n2) Second thing you pointed out about &quot;pre-requisite=\r\n&quot; of sadhna. what i think is that Pre-requisite of sadhna is just &quot;want to =\r\ndo sadhna&quot;\n\nWhile Sadhna it self is a pre-requsite to reach god (or to atta=\r\nin Moksha or any other objective)\n\nControlling anger, greed etc; to remove =\r\nconditioning of mind and to empty our &#39;Karma-fruit account balance&#39;. These =\r\nall three constitute sadhna. Process which constitute doing all the above t=\r\nhings is sadhna. \nControlling anger etc are not pre-requisite of saadhna, b=\r\nut controlling them itself is saadhna.\n\nWhen we achieve them, we attain the=\r\n moksha or what ever objectives we have. If we haven&#39;t achieved them yet, i=\r\nt means our Sadhna is incomplete. \n\nNow whether Vimlananda or Rishis were a=\r\nngry because of their incomplete sadhna or because of Divine will, I can no=\r\nt judge. Even if they were incomplete, Still they were lot lot better than =\r\nme and I need to respect them and learn from them.\n\nUdhav ji had Brahmgyana=\r\n. He was one of few persons who, in their living conciousness realised that=\r\n Shri Krishna is God Himself. But still he had some ego left in him. So Shr=\r\ni Krishna taught him lessons in his own way. And even after Lord Krishna le=\r\nft his Body, Udhav had to do Tapasya for many many years to achieve ultimat=\r\ne stage.\n\n3) Third thing was about saadhna and Sidhis.\n\nThere are numerous =\r\npaths for reaching God or we should say that there are many paths for doing=\r\n Sadhnas. Many in Hinduism itself, In sikhism, in Islam, Budhism etc etc al=\r\nl are paths for doing Saadhna. These all paths are different. But still the=\r\ny take us to same objective.\n\nThese all paths have two things in common.\n\na=\r\n) Mind Training\nb) Surrender to God.\n\nIn most of the Paths one is more prom=\r\ninent other is less prominent. Like in bhakti Yoga, Surrender to god is giv=\r\nen utmost important but Mind Training is to some extent only. While in Rajy=\r\noga or Hath Yoga Mind training is given more important and Surrender is to =\r\nsome extent.\nIn Karma yoga, Mind is trained in a different way using differ=\r\nent methods and in Gyan yoga Mind is trained in different way using differe=\r\nnt methods.\n\nTantra is a saadhna method where both Mind training and Surren=\r\nder are given equal importance and both these are done in a very aggressive=\r\n and fast manner. So it works very fast. \n\nMind Training part of Saadhna, p=\r\nroduces lot of energy in us. many names are given to this energy. This ener=\r\ngy is what gives Siddhis. \nSo on quest to find God, these Sidhis are just b=\r\ny-products or I term them as &quot;side effects&quot; for my own reference. They are =\r\nnot our aim when we are trying to reach God. We do not need sidhis but stil=\r\nl they are produced. When Vivekananda was offered sidhis by His Guru he ref=\r\nused to accept them as his guru acknowledged that these sidhis will not hel=\r\np him in achieving god. Although at later stage Vivekananda achieved lot of=\r\n Sidhis by himself.\n\nWhat I want to point here is that For achieving Sidhis=\r\n, 2nd aspect of surrender is not needed. One can achieve Sidhis by followin=\r\ng some methods but they will not help him reach God. They just add to his K=\r\narma-Fruit account and take aways from God.\n\nIn the book &quot;Concentration - B=\r\ny Mouni sadhu&quot;, Author explains simple techniques to achieve some simple si=\r\ndhis step by step. He also adds that one need not to believe in God to atta=\r\nin these sidhis. But if he use these sidhis in Quest for God these can be h=\r\nelpful. \n\nSo a person who had controlled his mind and trained his mind to a=\r\nchieve some powers does not mean that he has controlled his anger etc and h=\r\nas a love for God.\n\nBut for Vimalananda and other Rishis, I believe that he=\r\n was a person who had control on most of his instincts including anger. Alt=\r\nhough his level of intelligence and concious was so much different from us =\r\nthat we may not be able to understand why he did so.\n\nI am sorry for stretc=\r\nhing this mail too long. I hope some of your points were addressed in this =\r\nmail.\n\nplease pardon for my mistakes\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste N=\r\narasimha Rao Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I do understand that you are saying that it is import=\r\nant to efface once ego for \n&gt; success in sadhana and while I read and Vimal=\r\nananada&#39;s book and do like him for \n&gt; what he was able to achieve, I still =\r\nsee ego in him when he disrupts TV \n&gt; transmission of of an interview where=\r\n is he not rightly acknowledged or killing \n&gt; another sadhu for taking a sp=\r\nace he prefers for meditation in a cave. I also see \n&gt; ego in his Senior Gu=\r\nru Maharaj for cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of \n&gt; illness for not b=\r\neing given audience and I see ego in them in much the same way \n&gt; you and o=\r\nther people see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high \n&gt; calib=\r\ner. Yet people burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his \n&gt; =\r\nactions identified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon. =\r\n\n&gt; Robert Svoboda puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so we see on=\r\nly \n&gt; positive in him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by some scriptures=\r\n and we see \n&gt; only bad in him, yet he was a very powerful sadhaka than Vim=\r\nalanada or his \n&gt; senior guru maharaja for sure. So why cannot we see Ravan=\r\na&#39;s action as divine \n&gt; play and stop Ravana dahan on dussera? And if we se=\r\ne Ravana as egoisitic, then \n&gt; for sure why the incidents I mention from Vi=\r\nmalanada&#39;s book cannot be seen in a \n&gt; similar way. But htese are all great=\r\n sadhak and were greatly successful in \n&gt; whatever they tried to achieve fr=\r\nom their sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not very well versed with scriptures so I find =\r\nit hard to quote from them \n&gt; or remember all the names, but do you remembe=\r\nr a rishi from the Mahabharata who \n&gt; was pleaded to Duryodhana to pay a vi=\r\nsit pandavas in the forest. This rishi was \n&gt; very pleased by the hospitali=\r\nty shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi was well \n&gt; known for his temper and=\r\n often feared by people. It is exactly for this reason \n&gt; why Duryodhana in=\r\nvited this rishi to his palace and provided him with all \n&gt; hospitality so =\r\nthat he could convince this rishi to pay visit to panadavas who \n&gt; would no=\r\nt be able to accomodate the rishi this lavishly and therefore would have \n&gt;=\r\n to suffer his curse.If this rishi was so temperamental, how was he so succ=\r\nesful \n&gt; in his sadhana? I read so frequently=C2=A0about the need to give u=\r\np anger for success \n&gt; in sadhana.=C2=A0This apparently does not seem=C2=A0=\r\nto apply to=C2=A0this rishi. He was \n&gt; successful regardless. Vimalanada&#39;s =\r\nbook also mentions that this rishi was later \n&gt; punished by Lord Visnu and =\r\nhad 10,000 years of his tapasya fruits taken away \n&gt; from him. If everythin=\r\ng that these rishi&#39;s do has to be identified with their \n&gt; deity and theref=\r\nore cannot be faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not=\r\n saying that I should not change my svabhau to achieve success in \n&gt; sadhan=\r\na. It is never nice to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is \n&gt; certa=\r\ninly not easy to change once nature either. we can only hope that chnage in=\r\n \n&gt; svabhau can be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not going to=\r\n be \n&gt; successful in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svabha=\r\nu, and if we \n&gt; do not have the strength to change ourselves, basically bas=\r\ned on what you are \n&gt; saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am=\r\n not trying to start an \n&gt; argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see=\r\n ego in all the poeple of the \n&gt; stories I mentioned and all of them are ab=\r\nout great sadhaks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly that link to the=C2=A0post=C2=A0regarding Ma=\r\nnish is very interesting. You did not \n&gt; send this to me before. You did ma=\r\nke a mention though about Vimalanada Aghora \n&gt; series of books, and in the =\r\nsame message, you mentioned someone who was able to \n&gt; achieve specifioc re=\r\nsults from specific sadhana&#39;s by reading this book. That is \n&gt; what drew my=\r\n attention to that book and finally made me join this yahoo group as \n&gt; a w=\r\nay to get in touch with you. It could be that your message had gone to the =\r\n\n&gt; SPAM folder.You are very fortunate to have met him and=C2=A0have his gui=\r\ndance.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I am on this subject of success in sadhana, I do the Supe=\r\nr Short version \n&gt; of the homa on a=C2=A0weekly basis. As I read and try to=\r\n learn the regular version, I \n&gt; see that it makes use of darbha grass in v=\r\narious places. Just like you in \n&gt; Boston, we have a similar climate here i=\r\nn Toronto. How do you get grass let \n&gt; alone darbha during the 4-6 months o=\r\nf freezing temperature? Do you grow them in \n&gt; a pot? If so, what variety o=\r\nf lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? You also \n&gt; mention that one should no=\r\nt be looking for specific results from once sadhana. \n&gt; Before the commence=\r\nment of the sadhana or homa, what should one declare as the \n&gt; motive in su=\r\nch a case? I have to tell you here that I cannot lie about my \n&gt; intentions=\r\n to God. And=C2=A0if I do, I will probably keep thinking about it for the \n=\r\n&gt; duration of the sadhana and the whole experience gioes to waste as the mi=\r\nnd is \n&gt; not at ease.=C2=A0=C2=A0How about when one is not clear about the =\r\nspecific reasons for \n&gt; doing homa or sadhana but you were doing it for a s=\r\npecific purpose but now with \n&gt; purpose met, you are directionless but real=\r\nise the significance of sadhana or \n&gt; homa, feel good doing it=C2=A0and do =\r\nnot want to give up? Is it important to declare \n&gt; a motive before commenci=\r\nng sadhana?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _______________________=\r\n_________\n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\n&gt; Cc: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thu, November 18, 2=\r\n010 2:52:06 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Ego (Re: Success with Mantr=\r\nas)\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me add my 2 cents of perspective o=\r\nn your nice observations.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not illustr=\r\nate a picture of people who were\n&gt; &gt; compassionate and always willing to fo=\r\nrgive and forget.\n&gt; \n&gt; Forgiving and forgetting is not necessarily saattwik=\r\n, when it is the work of a \n&gt; dense ego. For example, one may do it to look=\r\n good or impress others. Similarly, \n&gt; hurting someone is not necessarily t=\r\naamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a \n&gt; light ego. For example, Mahar=\r\nshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his \n&gt; foot was a divine drama =\r\nfor a higher purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Copying the actions of divine beings requires so=\r\nme intelligence. To borrow an \n&gt; idiom from my mother tongue, a fox does no=\r\nt become a tiger if it paints stripes \n&gt; on its body.\n&gt; \n&gt; People you are t=\r\nalking about are very high level beings. Those who efface their \n&gt; ego and =\r\nstart to self-identify with some higher deities will start to exhibit \n&gt; th=\r\ne nature of those deities. Their actions may be fierce at times, but their =\r\n\n&gt; purpose will be divine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether one wants liberation or one wants s=\r\naayujya (togetherness) or yoga \n&gt; (oneness) of a deity or whatever one want=\r\ns, the first step is to efface ego. All \n&gt; sadhanas are meant for that only=\r\n. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or \n&gt; someone else achieved, the =\r\nstarting point is to efface your ego through sadhana. \n&gt; As you make progre=\r\nss, at some stage, you may start seeing some results.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nob=\r\nody here I\n&gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds =\r\nof rosary for a\n&gt; &gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required suc=\r\nh that our sadhana\n&gt; &gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if one is =\r\nthinking \n&gt; of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a century toda=\r\ny&quot; is unlikely to \n&gt; score a century. The best strategy is to take it a bal=\r\nl at a time and focus. \n&gt; Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop th=\r\ninking about results and just \n&gt; focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreo=\r\nver, liberation is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he=\r\n \n&gt; would come back a century later and that people would be liberated en m=\r\nasse in \n&gt; that birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this=\r\n list. Manish \n&gt; considers himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a=\r\n similar nature. I am \n&gt; privately aware of some incidents similar to what =\r\nyou described below with \n&gt; Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish&#39;s m=\r\nesage is to do sadhana and efface \n&gt; ego, i.e. what I wrote above.\n&gt; \n&gt; htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free=\r\n &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyoti=\r\nsh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;=\r\nb_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Atul Ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda certainly s=\r\neems like a cool person when we read about him but to \n&gt; &gt;say\n&gt; &gt; that some=\r\ntimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not learn \n&gt; &gt;well=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; is an understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book when he =\r\ngoes to \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? =\r\nAfter a brief\n&gt; &gt; argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0he d=\r\nies! Similarly when Robert\n&gt; &gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda duri=\r\nng a TV interview, Vimalananda \n&gt; goes\n&gt; &gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to =\r\nexplain his reasons for not acknowledging him.\n&gt; &gt; Vimalanada did not like =\r\nto draw attention to himself and secondly he was\n&gt; &gt; sick,=C2=A0and that wa=\r\ns the reason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had\n&gt; &gt; received fr=\r\nom Vimalananda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but\n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda =\r\ncould not be pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the\n&gt; &gt; time =\r\nthe interview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking\n&gt; &gt; acknow=\r\nledgement even when he claims he does not like public attention! \n&gt; Probabl=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; transmission breaking down was again part of divine will you think? R=\r\nobert\n&gt; &gt; Sbvoboda himself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing wit=\r\nh Vimalananda\n&gt; &gt; was impossible especially when one knows he is wrong but =\r\nwill never admit to \n&gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; mistake.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then there was the story o=\r\nf his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience by \n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; sick sadhu. =\r\nThe senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curses this ill\n&gt; &gt; sadh=\r\nu with lifetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally succumbs to that \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;and\n&gt; &gt; dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am denied audience, do I=\r\n curse them \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; death?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not ill=\r\nustrate a picture of people who were\n&gt; &gt; compassionate and always willing t=\r\no forgive and forget. But still, they were\n&gt; &gt; hugely successful in their s=\r\nadhana in their own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; &gt; talking about here....=\r\nthe pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n&gt; &gt; thinks expects t=\r\no acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; &gt; particular =\r\nmantra....but certianly what is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; &gt; produces=\r\n results that are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling \n&gt; &gt;thoug=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; that there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n pre-requisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and \n&gt; =\r\ncontinue\n&gt; &gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if \n&gt; &gt;those\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; channels are not clean then that energy flow can create unpleasant experi=\r\nences\n&gt; &gt; like increased anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clea=\r\nn enough.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rishis have clean channels and they flow along with divin=\r\ne will. curses and\n&gt; &gt; blessings they give are just part of divine will. li=\r\nke curse given to lord\n&gt; &gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. simi=\r\nlarly curses given to yadav\n&gt; &gt; vansh and king prikshit played an important=\r\n role. vimlananda was a cool guy\n&gt; &gt; except few times when he was markedly =\r\nirritated.Like in an incidence where one\n&gt; &gt; of his female disciple tried t=\r\no illude him by coming almost naked in front of\n&gt; &gt; him to learn how to bec=\r\nome a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that \n&gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; student d=\r\nid not learnt well what he taught to her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On other side people =\r\nwith some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be \n&gt; able\n&gt; &gt; to handle=\r\n that energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like\n&gt; &gt; ra=\r\nvana and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i personally believe that this =\r\n\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; also part of divine will.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please forgive me for my mi=\r\nstakes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
