The modified version\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; applies a lot to us, fools lost in oblivion trying to learn more and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n more and more theories instead of doing sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quoted with modi=\r\nfications pertaining to Mr God.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;There was a young man, you know=\r\n, who wanted to reach god/be super\n&gt; &gt; siddha or something and so he went t=\r\no this guru. The guru was very very\n&gt; &gt; advanced, a legend in his own right=\r\n. And he told the guru you know I\n&gt; &gt; wanna be on the same level you are an=\r\nd the guru said if you wanna be on\n&gt; &gt; the same level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met you =\r\ntomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the young man got there 4 A.M. he was  a=\r\nll ready to rock n&#39; roll.\n&gt; &gt; He was dressed properly, but he should have w=\r\norn shorts. The old man\n&gt; &gt; grabs his hand and said: How bad do you wanna b=\r\ne successful (basically\n&gt; &gt; achieve god, have siddhi and the like, all refe=\r\nrences to success from\n&gt; &gt; hereon now mean uniting with god) ? He said: &quot;Re=\r\nal bad&quot;. He\n&gt; &gt; said: Walk on out in the water. So he walks out into the wa=\r\nter. When he\n&gt; &gt; walks out to the water he goes waist deep and goes like th=\r\nis old man is\n&gt; &gt; crazy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The young man was thinking , &quot;Hey I wanna=\r\n meet god, achieve siddhi in my\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, get out of this birth death cy=\r\ncle etc. etc. and this foolish\n&gt; &gt; old man got me out here swimming. I didn=\r\n&#39;t ask to be a lifeguard. I\n&gt; &gt; wanna meet god he got me in water =96 so th=\r\ne old man said go on a\n&gt; &gt; little further =96 the young man walked out a li=\r\nttle further =96\n&gt; &gt; then the young man was neck deep in water - the young =\r\nman was thinking \n&gt; &gt; this old man is crazy =96 everybody calls him a param=\r\nhansa, a\n&gt; &gt; mahapurusha, god incarnate but he is definitely crazy. So the =\r\nold man\n&gt; &gt; again said go on out a little further =96 the young man went ou=\r\nt a\n&gt; &gt; little further, the water was now right at his mouth =96the young m=\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; was now thinking of going back, this old hack is out of his fucking\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; mind. And then the old man said: &quot;I thought you said you wanted to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbe successful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &quot;Then walk a\n&gt; &gt; little further.&quot;=\r\n Then the old man followed this guy into the water,\n&gt; &gt; he grabbed the youn=\r\ng man&#39;s head, and held him down underwater. The old\n&gt; &gt; guy held the young =\r\nman, till  the young man was about to pass out, the\n&gt; &gt; young guys arms wer=\r\ne now splashing the water in desperation, then\n&gt; &gt; suddenly the guru raised=\r\n him up. He said: &quot;I got a question for\n&gt; &gt; you.&quot; He told the young guy, he=\r\n said: &quot;When you want to succeed\n&gt; &gt; as bad as you wanna breathe than you w=\r\nill be successful.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (Succeed =3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or ac=\r\nhieving supernatural\n&gt; &gt; powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, =\r\nupto you.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how many of you all got asthma here in Ved=\r\nic wisdom? If\n&gt; &gt; you ever had a asthma attack before, you are short of bre=\r\nath S.O.B,due\n&gt; &gt; to shortness of breath, you start wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, ha=\r\ni&quot; like you\n&gt; &gt; have run 10,000kms in one go, the only thing you are trying=\r\n to do at\n&gt; &gt; that moment during the attack, is get some air. You don&#39;t car=\r\ne about\n&gt; &gt; no basketball game, you don&#39;t care about what&#39;s on T.V., you\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; don&#39;t care about nobody calling you, you don&#39;t care about a\n&gt; &gt; party. Th=\r\ne only thing you care about when you trying to breathe is to\n&gt; &gt; get some f=\r\nresh air. That&#39;s it! And when you get to the point where\n&gt; &gt; all you wanna =\r\ndo is be is successful as bad as you wanna breathe then\n&gt; &gt; you will be suc=\r\ncessful. And I&#39;m here to tell you that number one,\n&gt; &gt; most of you say you =\r\nwanna be successful but you don&#39;t want it bad,\n&gt; &gt; you just kind of want it=\r\n. You don&#39;t want it bad than you wanna\n&gt; &gt; party. You don&#39;t want it as much=\r\n as you want to be cool. Most of you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want success as much as you =\r\nwant sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (Again Success =3D uniting with god, or seeing god, =\r\nor achieving\n&gt; &gt; supernatural powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subject=\r\nive, upto\n&gt; &gt; you.)\n&gt; &gt; End Quote\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ignore the following video , foc=\r\nus on the audio in it. with the above\n&gt; &gt; modifications.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.you=\r\ntube.com/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU_J0A\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do all of you remember that Visa ca=\r\nll from your perspective\n&gt; &gt; embassies????\n&gt; &gt; Remember those???\n&gt; &gt; The in=\r\nterviews???\n&gt; &gt; Even if you had slept at 4 in the morning, the night before=\r\n, you would\n&gt; &gt; still wake up and be at the embassy office at 7, or wheneve=\r\nr your\n&gt; &gt; appointment was.\n&gt; &gt; Hell even if you had high fever 102 or some=\r\nthing, you would still reach.\n&gt; &gt; Do you remember that flight to the states=\r\n???\n&gt; &gt; Ohhhh Ammmerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!!

Wah, wah!!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surely sire/ madame, god =\r\nwill be yours, yes, yes surely.

N=\r\no matter if you periodically\n&gt; &gt; fail.\n&gt; &gt; Did you start managing your food=\r\n intake????\n&gt; &gt; Did you start chanting the name of god as much as you can e=\r\nven after\n&gt; &gt; reading this line a thousand times that death is the ultimate=\r\n reality\n&gt; &gt; and who knows when you die ????\n&gt; &gt; How many homams you did???=\r\nOh you dont have time do you?? But you seem to\n&gt; &gt; have time for everything=\r\n else in life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then what was the use for all the discussions =\r\nbecause once your computer\n&gt; &gt; is switched off, nothing changes in your lif=\r\ne, your mind has made a\n&gt; &gt; fuddu out of you by foxing you into thinking, &quot;=\r\nsir I have done something\n&gt; &gt; about my pitiable state.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then you r=\r\nead Mr Nandy&#39;s post about the story of &quot;p&quot;, and say what an\n&gt; &gt; eye opener,=\r\n what excitement, what a story!!!!!! But errrrrr=85=85=85=85\n&gt; &gt; what did y=\r\nou do post that???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see people shortening their mall trips,=\r\n their shopping sprees,\n&gt; &gt; their time on the internet but when it comes to=\r\n a homam, first question\n&gt; &gt; or thought is &quot;oh my gawd, it will take that l=\r\nong, let me ask Mr Rao of\n&gt; &gt; making it shorter.&quot; And god is so magnanimous=\r\n, he allows you to do so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hell you spend more time on buying your =\r\nkacche, panty, banyan and bras\n&gt; &gt; rather than on god!!!!!! Wah, wah, surel=\r\ny god will be yours.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then you pick up books, all sort of books rea=\r\nd all about other guys\n&gt; &gt; reaching god, start reading into their experienc=\r\nes, start discussing\n&gt; &gt; about their high spiritual states and everything, =\r\nand get lost  in\n&gt; &gt; arguing over those discussions. Then post apologies, m=\r\ny goodness, the\n&gt; &gt; noise. Waste of a human birth, if you were to see the l=\r\nine waiting for a\n&gt; &gt; human womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; have to stand at the=\r\n end of this line,\n&gt; &gt; you would piss yourself. Some girl after seeing it d=\r\nid, and has always\n&gt; &gt; been a little urgent with her sadhana ever since the=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do you find =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; guru????&quot;\n&gt; &gt; And you know everyone, wants a high powered one, not an=\r\ny other will do.\n&gt; &gt; See a high powered guru, also requires a good disciple=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; Are you good enough, honestly answer this??? Many will say no, many w=\r\nill\n&gt; &gt; say good or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it etc etc, but ar=\r\ne you\n&gt; &gt; willing to work on yourself to spare the guru some work???? Why w=\r\nould a\n&gt; &gt; high powered one come and teach you??? only after your penance i=\r\ns good\n&gt; &gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy in his/her union with =\r\ngod.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now how bad do you want god?\n&gt; &gt; How bad do you want a g=\r\nuru?\n&gt; &gt;   How bad do you want those spiritual states?\n&gt; &gt; How bad do you w=\r\nant the darsahn for your beloved?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it b=\r\nad, time is running out, and very soon,\n&gt; &gt; another rebirth, again the youn=\r\ng age, again the teenage, again the\n&gt; &gt; affairs, again the hormone spikes, =\r\nagain the degrees, again the sucky\n&gt; &gt; jobs, again confused with life, agai=\r\nn the financial nightmares, again\n&gt; &gt; the heart attacks , again the death, =\r\nand again, again. Hai ram!!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll end this post with an example, =\r\na businessman in Delhi in the\n&gt; &gt; 1940&#39;s, had done a bit of penance and you=\r\n know was highly interested in\n&gt; &gt; god , shod and all this stuff. So one da=\r\ny , he had gone to kerala, and\n&gt; &gt; met a guy who was proclaimed in the vill=\r\nage to be equivalent to lord\n&gt; &gt; voldmeort or something but on the god side=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the guy went to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t be taken and as=\r\nked him\n&gt; &gt; , i am looking for a guru, the old fella said , for what exactl=\r\ny are you\n&gt; &gt; looking for a guru??? The business man said, , you know to le=\r\narn stuff.\n&gt; &gt; The old fellow said what are you willing to do for your guru=\r\n??? The\n&gt; &gt; businessman said anything. The old fella said, okay take all yo=\r\nur\n&gt; &gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy took them off=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a patta around your\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The businessman was aghast, but the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the businessman very BADLY\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got shoes thrown at him, came back after\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; half an hour to find the old fella gone and his clothes gone too. He sat\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; there sobbing, and sobbing and cursing god, that i was the biggest fool=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to come here and trust this man. But then as he haid read somewhere, w=\r\nhy\n&gt; &gt; waste time, he started meditating and chanted. 3 hours went by no si=\r\ngn\n&gt; &gt; of the old man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, the old fella reappeared, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; said &quot; here are your clothes, go back to your town.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bu=\r\nsinessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to get up, but\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;=\r\nt move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that finally\n&gt; &gt; he has=\r\n found someone worthy enough to teach. Somebody who actually wants\n&gt; &gt; it &quot;=\r\nbad&quot;.Old fella took the hotshot as his disciple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Punjabi fans ----=\r\n-&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Makkah gayan=E2=80=A8\n&gt; &gt; Gal mukdi nahin\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=A8Paven sau s=\r\nau jummen padhaiye\n&gt; &gt; Ganga gayan\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=A8Gal mukdi nahin=E2=80=A8\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Paven sau sau gothey khaiye\n&gt; &gt; Gaya gayan\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=A8Gal mukdi nahin=\r\n=E2=80=A8\n&gt; &gt; Paven sau sau panD padhaiye\n&gt; &gt; Bulleh Shah!=E2=80=A8\n&gt; &gt; Gal=\r\n taiyon mukdi=E2=80=A8\n&gt; &gt; Jadon menu dilon gavaiye.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Parh parh ilm=\r\n hazaar kitaabaN\n&gt; &gt; kadi apne aap nu parhya nahin\n&gt; &gt; Jaa jaa wardey manda=\r\nr maseetan\n&gt; &gt; kadi mann apne wich wareya nahin\n&gt; &gt; Anven larda shaitaan de=\r\n naal bandeya\n&gt; &gt; kadi nafs apne naal larya nahin\n&gt; &gt; Aakhe peer Bulleh Sha=\r\nh aasmani pharna aeN\n&gt; &gt; jehra man wich wasda unhoN pharya nahin\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (=\r\njisko samajh mien aye who baakiyon ke liye transalte kare )\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Satya =\r\nShri Akaal\n&gt; &gt; Jai mere kaal\n&gt; &gt; Nobody\n&gt; &gt; P.S.
