Especially the one\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is modeled in the form of a bear, and claps its hands as soon=\r\n as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is powered on. Its hands hold two plates which strike each o=\r\nther ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bear&#39;s eyes light up as soon as the battery is put in, a=\r\nnd boom, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are ready to go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Yes, yes, I=\r\n have seen those. There are other types also, like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you put bat=\r\nteries in a car model, it suddenly starts operating, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going bonk=\r\ners, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating some cuddly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line=\r\ns. It is loved by girls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, exactly.

But anywa=\r\nys, leave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this fucking business aside for a moment. Lets go back to=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion, the end of which will be very fun.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Student: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Te=\r\nacher : Don&#39;t twist my words, I said right now you are akin to a teddy\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; bear. You have been that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claps, basically all the battery powered toys earlier. In philosoph=\r\nical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terms they are called &quot;births&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : How=\r\n may I ask?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : What is your name?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nStudent : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humorous\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; reasons)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of cham=\r\nan sharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as the bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps=\r\n and claps,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;I am Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I=\r\n am 20 years old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; , i like this girl, I love playing sports, I live =\r\nhere, I read this, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hate that, I this, and I that&quot;, okay?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about himself*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner t=\r\nhan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later, do you know what happens or what that means?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t die.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teach=\r\ner : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever realized it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Are you not afraid of death?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : No, I am not afrai=\r\nd of death.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The lights turn off in the room, there is tota=\r\nl darkness, for 5 minutes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no noise, but Chaman gets terrif=\r\nied, and then a pair of deep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; red eyes appear in the dark, and in th=\r\ne most ghastly voice ever asks Mr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaman, &quot;why are you so afraid? t=\r\nhe basis of all fear is death, and only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lights have gone out, I=\r\n haven&#39;t even started with you yet, if you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say you are not going to=\r\n die, then why so scared?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suddenly the lights turn back o=\r\nn, the teacher is laughing his ass off,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Chaman shivering.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : You said you were not afraid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stude=\r\nnt : I never meant it, like that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Then in what w=\r\nay did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical stuff in thi=\r\ns spirituality business is far greater than all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your books combined=\r\n. You get lost while reading, you think you are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different. To me yo=\r\nu are no worse than the thousand others I meet,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in-fact they are be=\r\ntter off without the texts you have studied.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Agr=\r\need, but don&#39;t scare me like that. Again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : I will=\r\n, if you make such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where were we?=\r\n The death of the teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remains, =\r\nthe outer shell remains, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eith=\r\ner buried or burnt, in essence done away with, because it is of no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nuse. Right?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Wro=\r\nng. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, when you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remove the ba=\r\nttery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useless, it =\r\ncan&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t do shit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a=\r\nt death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s body. You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neve=\r\nr die, you are only the battery powering this personality which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lea=\r\nds to powering your body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: How can you even=85=85\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Lets consider that you are two batteries, two aa=\r\n sized ones.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you plug the batteries into a car, suddenly the c=\r\nar comes to life,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without the battery the car is idle, but as soon =\r\nas I put the battery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in, the car goes=85=85.. beep beep honk honk, =\r\nmove, I am a car.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : sits in silence knowing well t=\r\nhat interrupting now will be the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; biggest mistake ever.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Teacher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it in=\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lets say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing=\r\n a song,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or acts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Teddy is idle, literally useless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher=\r\n : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery that powered the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; car=\r\n, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bear, and it is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; same battery that can power any toy, correct?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : =\r\nCorrect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : While the battery is in the car, it beli=\r\neves itself to be the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; car. It believes &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red co=\r\nlour, 198 bhp, 70 mm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; torque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at=\r\n the back, hot woman in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passengers seat, I am the king baby, loo=\r\nk at how hot I am&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: Oh dear god=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Teacher : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; useless piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believes itself to be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am th=\r\ne teddy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddl=\r\ny I am, I can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even clap my hands &quot;, and when I take the battery out=\r\n, PHAT, the teddy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is=85..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Useless, and d=\r\nead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Thats a useless conclusion, it is known by =\r\nthe world, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized. Every tom dick and harry knows that, Lets =\r\ngo deeper. The point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the battery confuses itself to be the teddy=\r\n or the god damn car.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So the battery is the soul=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* Who said that?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : You did.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : *another pha=\r\ntek on the head of the student* When did I say?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You read it in one =\r\nof your fancy articles and commentaries and satsangs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that people do=\r\n, genius, and you read it all too wrong, you read it and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thus think=\r\n you &#39;know&#39;, you never practiced, fools you people are. Most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the=\r\n time you people are fed bullshit and you gobble it up like pigs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\n mud. That reminds me we haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  pizza in a long\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nime, lets order one. LOL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Sorry=85\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Teacher : Don&#39;t be, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion on toys. The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confuse yourself to be Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you h=\r\nave been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plugged into a a toy (read body) and the confusion prevail=\r\ns. Focus on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;confusion&quot; aspect.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Then=\r\n who am I?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : You are the ever lasting consciousnes=\r\ns, the universal bliss,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the infinite, the ever pervading light of t=\r\nhe universe!!! Breathe in and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out and feel the bliss!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Student : Yess!!! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; *Smells huge amounts of odor*=85=85 What is that smell?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Teacher : I just farted, feels so blissful, did you feel your bliss to=\r\no?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Ewwwww=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Bhutni =\r\nke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in search o=\r\nf who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and out,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and t=\r\nhinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Befk=\r\nuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : But you only said that  &quot;=\r\nYou are the ever lasting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness, the universal bliss, the in=\r\nfinite, the ever pervading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; light of the universe!!!

QED =3D  quite easily done.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Thats one more self identification of being duracell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nStudent: *Feels quite proud*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : And THAT is one mor=\r\ne self identification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Hey Ram!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Teacher : Ram Ram.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So I theoretically understa=\r\nnd it , but how do I actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher =\r\n: You do Sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Sitting in a yogic pose and fo=\r\ncusing on the lotus and all?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : I will fucking beat=\r\n you to your death if you repeat this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bullshit ever again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: Sorry=85\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : No need to be. That i=\r\ns what is meant by Sadhana to most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people. But does anyone know wha=\r\nt is Sadhana?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : You shed some light on it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basically in essence, and mark these all important words.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot; YOU trying to convince yourself that &quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Births are spent on this my boy, births not lives, it takes a lot of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort to tell and convince yourself that you are just not you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : and how do you do that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : By=\r\n sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually you=\r\nrself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realizing =\r\nthe deity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one (th=\r\ne source of all the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ki=\r\n tarana, does it not?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So by sadhana , I will rea=\r\nlize that I am the battery and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this personality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Teacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n yourself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: I am beginning to understand a little,=\r\n can you explain where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does a deity stand in this whole battery con=\r\ncept?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : If you are the battery, the battery has to=\r\n have a source, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not svayambhu that you exist on you own. Th=\r\ne deity is like a huge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power station in your comparison. It is almo=\r\nst infinite, but since it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a power station it is bound to have a =\r\nboundary somewhere, but to you, aa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sized battery it is endless. Cha=\r\nman&#39;s source is his parents, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery)=\r\n parent is the power station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Hmmm=85.. that&#39;s w=\r\nhy she is worshipped as ma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha=\r\n?? A guy or a girl who has realized that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he/she himself is the batt=\r\nery and then went on to become one with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power station and thus se=\r\nes himself/herself in everything because the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power station is the s=\r\nource of everything , of all batteries. And since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he/she actually k=\r\nnows that all elements too are currents and everything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else too, he=\r\n/she actually sees it as that. And thus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say I =\r\nfully well don&#39;t see a difference between me and this table, thus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n am this table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I can do it, because I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; am actually it. To you it is a table, to me it is just a current, who is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just &quot;me&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: Oooohhhhhhhh=85=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but thats how your eyes perceiv=\r\ne him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be as, an old man with frail clothing, belongs to shirdi e=\r\ntc etc, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inside he is far beyond what you or I can comprehend. H=\r\ne first realized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was a battery by doing penance, thus killing hi=\r\nmself in the process,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the he realized that the battery is as good a=\r\ns the power station because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the current is the same, so he became o=\r\nne with that, and then he went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond and came back to guide as he =\r\nwas chosen, just like many others\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are, like my great teacher, guru =\r\nnanak dev, Ramakrishna and all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others=85=85=85\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stu=\r\ndent : And the source of the power station is?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : T=\r\nhe one- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put into words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becaus=\r\ne he is infinite and the words are finite. It is purely on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining=\r\n him religious wars, riots between religions , and intellectual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dis=\r\ncussions and debates on this thing called internet happen, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he/s=\r\nhe/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people focus on that , and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nget lost, but focus on the power station (deity) and it will take you to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; big daddy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine an endless field of current in comparison =\r\nof the power station ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an endless current which exists and all othe=\r\nrs are a figment of it. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power stations are a part of it, the cu=\r\nrrent has taken the form of one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concentrated zone.. But even this c=\r\nontains error of speech, so chuck it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The ultimate is only realized=\r\n when you are one with the power station so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lets focus there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So the one has taken forms of different power station=\r\ns to help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the batteries who are spread out to help unite back with =\r\nit?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Brilliant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: So all =\r\nour lives we debate/fight and cut each other off to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claim which pow=\r\ner station (deity) is more powerful over the other and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; superior to =\r\nall others, when in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be dif=\r\nferent, when they are in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; laughing=\r\n back at us?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : ho ho ho=85.. Go on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Student : And we try to worship 10 different ones and always think that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we should worship as many to get maximum benefit for our mistakingl=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused identities of teddy , the car and all other toys?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : *smokes slowly*=85 I am listening.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; St=\r\nudent: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debates and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock feathers\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; and punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts which=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they don&#39;t know a thing about?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher: Yes,Speak=\r\ning of Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; battery. the stu=\r\npidest thing in the world is this concept of &quot;my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundalini&quot;, err=85=\r\n. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many make this=\r\n error, but it is essential because other wise you can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explain th=\r\ne concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;you&quot;=\r\n will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n say a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; glory . Whatever you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; limitations of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: So then=\r\n how do realized souls stay in their bodies post their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realization?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher: Intentional identification with the personality =\r\nby permission\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the power station to fulfill some higher purpose=\r\n of the power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; station to guide more batteries to realize that they =\r\nare not toys. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they can leave in an instant, because they know r=\r\nealities that are much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; higher than our world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stud=\r\nent : So what is moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : It is a concept that is=\r\n best left alone, if you haven&#39;t merged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back with a power station y=\r\nourself first. You tell me when you have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merged back, how do you kn=\r\now what if feels like to be merged back? You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself have become o=\r\nne with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the battery has di=\r\nssolved, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remember\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, because =\r\nyou are not there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : I can&#39;t explain it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : We can&#39;t, It is like explaining the color red to a blind =\r\nman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You will say mars  is red or the red light is red, he will say=\r\n I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been blind from birth I don&#39;t know what you are talking abo=\r\nut. You will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say tomato, he will say fuck off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stu=\r\ndent : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : it can be =\r\nto an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topic. To add t=\r\no ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a helic=\r\nopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the c=\r\nar is very different form the toy, thus if you explain a high level\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n concept to both, both will understand differently and have a go at it\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; with debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is bot=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are dur=\r\nacell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are =\r\nduracell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance nake=\r\nd on the road.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : What?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : =\r\nYou thought 4 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student: But I will be disgraced.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will l=\r\naugh at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this=\r\n thousand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times before, so what??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : I hate=\r\n you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : I love you too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student :=\r\n You are serious on this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nStudent: : This is why some of the higher ones don&#39;t give a shit about\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; roaming naked and doing wild stuff, just to keep people away from them.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but a lot of frauds copy and disgrace the =\r\nhigher ones.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Fine, I will do it. But you will ha=\r\nndle my parent&#39;s reaction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Done.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; After the student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; day, yet every one saw it that day, and seemed to make faces at the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; student for an hour or so. How everybody forgot is a different stor=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; altogether.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do sadhana, before your battery is p=\r\nulled out, replugged into another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; toy and yet again, your confusion=\r\n will prevail driving you to do things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that will push you further a=\r\nnd further down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Shree Radheya!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
