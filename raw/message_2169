This total solar eclipse has interesting \n&gt;&gt; planetary combinations. This is a great time for spiritual progress. In \n&gt;&gt; Boston time (EDT), the eclipse is from 7:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 12:18 \n&gt;&gt; am on 2009 July 22. In India time (IST), it is from 5:28 am to 9:48 am on \n&gt;&gt; 2009 July 22. In GMT, it is from 11:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 4:18 am on \n&gt;&gt; 2009 July 22.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can meditate, do homam (to any deity) or just contemplate on the \n&gt;&gt; meaning of life, who you are or on some articles or books you read. \n&gt;&gt; Whatever sadhana you do during the eclipse time, all the best!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BTW, I am reproducing a small note I wrote in Astrological eMagazine \n&gt;&gt; (from the publishers of Astrological Magazine) below.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; A Note on the Eclipses in July-Aug 2009\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The occurrence of three consecutive eclipses - a lunar eclipse on 2009 \n&gt;&gt; July 7, a solar eclipse on 2009 July 22 and another lunar eclipse on 2009 \n&gt;&gt; August 6 - has generated a lot of interest. Especially the solar eclipse \n&gt;&gt; of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts \n&gt;&gt; in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi and \n&gt;&gt; navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Eclipse time is a very favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though \n&gt;&gt; temple rituals are halted during eclipses. There is a reason for it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sun and Moon are the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). \n&gt;&gt; Microcosmically, individual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the \n&gt;&gt; eyes through which we see the dual world around us. If individual soul \n&gt;&gt; and individual mind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in \n&gt;&gt; the field of duality. The objectification within Brahman ceases and one \n&gt;&gt; is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other \n&gt;&gt; words, one realizes Self.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To fulfil one&#39;s dharma as an individual in the field of duality, one \n&gt;&gt; needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized \n&gt;&gt; consciousness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or \n&gt;&gt; Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple \n&gt;&gt; rituals, which are performed for collective dharma of society, are \n&gt;&gt; understandably halted. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana \n&gt;&gt; for self-realization. This applies to homam as well. If one performs \n&gt;&gt; homam for material benefits, one should stop during an eclipse. However, \n&gt;&gt; if one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-realization, a \n&gt;&gt; homam performed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at other \n&gt;&gt; times. One can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though homam \n&gt;&gt; to an ugra devata may work better.\n\n\n"}}
