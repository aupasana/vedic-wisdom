Out of all p=\r\nlanet-mahavidya mappings I have seen, this is the most philosophically soun=\r\nd mapping.\n \nSun - Taaraa - Raama\nMoon - Kaali - Krishna\nMars - Bhairavi - =\r\nNrisimha\nMercury - Maatangi - Buddha\nJupiter - Dhumaavati - Vaamana\nVenus -=\r\n Chhinnamastaa - Bhaargava Rama\nSaturn - Bagalamukhi - Koorma\nRahu - Bhuvan=\r\neswari - Varaaha\nKetu - Kamala - Matsya\n \n*        *        *\n \nVidya is kn=\r\nowledge. Mahavidya is supreme knowledge. Dasa mahavidyas are the ten highes=\r\nt forms of knowledge that take us to moksha or liberation, approaching from=\r\n different angles. Other kinds of knowledge (e.g. mathematics, physics, ast=\r\nronomy, astrology, grammar etc) do not liberate us. But these ten kinds of =\r\nknowledge liberate us. The deities (names and forms described in books for =\r\nten mahavidyas) are personifications of those ten types of supreme knowledg=\r\ne that liberate us.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPlease note one thing here. Mok=\r\nsha means overcoming the maayaa of the duality around us. Seeing some thing=\r\ns as desirable, some as undesirable, some as pleasurable, some as painful, =\r\nsome as beautiful, some as ugly etc is what binds us. Overcoming the dualit=\r\ny and seeing all as Brahman is liberation or moksha.\n \nDifferent planets re=\r\npresent different aspects of our selves. The duality around us and the way =\r\nto overcome it seem different from different angles. From the point of view=\r\n of individual soul (Sun), this maayaa is something that needs to be overco=\r\nme by crossing and reaching the other end (supreme cosmic soul). From the p=\r\noint of view of mind (Moon), this duality is something that clouds the visi=\r\non and needs to be destroyed so that it cannot tempt again. From the point =\r\nof view of the intellect/discrimination/dhee (Jupiter), it issomething that=\r\n is non-existent anyway (&quot;so what was the problem in the first place?&quot;), li=\r\nke shapes made of smoke. From the point of view of initiative and energy wi=\r\nthin us (Mars), it is something that needs to be fought hard and fearlessly=\r\n. From the point of view of the learning ability within us (Mercury), it is=\r\n something that needs to be learnt and understood fully so that we can over=\r\ncome it. From the point of view of enjoyment and happiness (Venus), it is s=\r\nomething that needs to be accepted and enjoyed and not something to fear or=\r\n avoid (&quot;after all, all is Brahman. Then why stay away from enjoyments?&quot;). =\r\nAnd so on.\n \nBut remember one important thing. Whichever approach is taken =\r\nto overcoming duality, the end result is the same. One first masters the ap=\r\nproach. It becomes part of one&#39;s common sense and thinking. One eventually =\r\novercomes duality. One becomes self-realized and becomes liberated. That en=\r\nd result is the same irrespective of the approach chosen.\n \n*        *     =\r\n   *\n \nSun is the soul within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from=\r\n delving deep into this aspect is what makes one wade (tar=3Dswim/wade/cros=\r\ns) the ocean of delusion and get to the source. If you master the knowledge=\r\n that helps one view the world as an ocean that needs to be crossed to reac=\r\nh the supreme, other things will follow and you eventually get liberation. =\r\nTaaraa personifies this knowledge.\n \nMoon is the mind within us. The highes=\r\nt form of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is an underst=\r\nanding of attachments and desires, their impermanence and how to kill them.=\r\n If you master the knowledge that kills all attachments and desires and giv=\r\nes perfect control on the mind, other things will follow and you eventually=\r\n get liberation. Kaali personifies this knowledge.\n \nMars is the energy and=\r\n initiative within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from delving de=\r\nep into this aspect is what gives one fearlessness of anything in the unive=\r\nrse. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fearless and you do=\r\n not fear anything (including death or pain!) other things will follow and =\r\nyou eventually get liberation. Bhairavi personifies this knowledge.\n \nMercu=\r\nry is knowledge and learning ability within us. The highest form of knowled=\r\nge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives one learning of =\r\nvarious topics. If you master the knowledge that give you mastery of all ki=\r\nnds of learning through logical and rational thinking, other things will fo=\r\nllow and you eventually get liberation. Maatangi personifies this knowledge=\r\n. In fact, some people associate Maatangi with Saraswati. Saraswati is also=\r\n known as &quot;Maatanga Kanya&quot;.\n \nJupiter is the intellect, wisdom and discrimi=\r\nnation (dhee shakti) within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from d=\r\nelving deep into this aspect is that all is delusion. The individual soul a=\r\nnd individual mind and everything they perceive is just an illusion. All th=\r\nat is there is Brahman. Any other perceptions, of various good or bad thing=\r\ns, are just a delusion, like figures made of smoke. If you master the knowl=\r\nedge that makes your intellect shine, you will realize that the entire worl=\r\nd is a delusion and not deluded by anything anymore. Then other things will=\r\n follow and you eventually get liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this know=\r\nledge.\n \nVenus is the spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of kn=\r\nowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes one egoless=\r\n and blissful. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fearless =\r\nand you do not fear anything, including death or pain, other things will fo=\r\nllow and you eventually get liberation. Chhinnamasta personifies this knowl=\r\nedge. She is depicted as a deity holding her own severed head, standing nea=\r\nr a naked couple in copulation and surrounded by associates who are drinkin=\r\ng wine. One mastering this knowledge need not stay away from any pleasures,=\r\n but one learns to see god even those pleasures. However, pleasure obtained=\r\n with an ego (&quot;*I* am enjoying this act or object&quot;) binds. The headless sta=\r\nte symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome I-ness, pleasures are not bi=\r\nnding. One not thinking in terms of &quot;*I* am enjoying&quot; but having no sense o=\r\nf &quot;I&quot; can live life without running away from any pleasures or undertaking =\r\nany austerities and yet become liberated.\n \nSaturn is the spirit of hard wo=\r\nrk within us. He also represents our weaknesses and sins. The highest form =\r\nof knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes us rea=\r\nlize our internal enemies and destroy them. If you master the knowledge tha=\r\nt makes you overcome weaknesses such as laziness and internal enemies such =\r\nas lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc, other things will follow and you eventu=\r\nally get liberation. Bagalamukhi personifies this knowledge. Most of her ma=\r\nntras ask to destroy enemies and so people foolishly think that she is the =\r\none who gives success in litigation and worship her for court cases. This i=\r\ns like going to a king to ask for two spoons of sugar for your milk. You go=\r\n to the king for bigger things and a neighbor is enough for giving you two =\r\nspoons of sugar. The enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are internal enemies =\r\nand your own laziness. Remember, she is a mahavidya, i.e. a type of supreme=\r\n knowledge that liberates you!\n \nRahu is the spirit of material well-being =\r\nwithin us. Rahu is the one who binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn show=\r\ning sins and Rahu showing rebirth are important in the death chart). The hi=\r\nghest form of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what g=\r\nives us worldly success in a dhaarmik way. If you master the knowledge that=\r\n makes you materially successful in a dharmik way, you become successful an=\r\nd fulfil all your duties and debts in the world and eventually get liberati=\r\non. Bhuvaneswari personifies this knowledge.\n \nKetu is the spirit of of det=\r\nachment and Vedic knowledge within us. The highest form of knowledge coming=\r\n from delving deep into this aspect is the essense of Veda. If you master t=\r\nhe knowledge that enables you to be in oneness with the supreme cosmic bein=\r\ng, you eventually get liberation. Kamala (Mahaalakshmi) personifies this kn=\r\nowledge. According to saptashati rahasya also, Mahaalakshmi is the Aadyaa (=\r\nthe first One). She is the energy of supreme cosmic being. She divides Hers=\r\nelf into 3 parts - Mahaakaali, Mahaalakshmi and MahaaSaraswati and they cre=\r\nate Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts. Kamala represents the knowled=\r\nge of the supreme cosmic energy of the supreme cosmic being.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nOne of the above is not superior to the other. Depending on your =\r\nvasanas (mental conditioning), attitudes, likes and dislikes, depending on =\r\nwhich aspect of your personality dominates over other aspects (the sinfulne=\r\nss and weaknesses? or the interest in learning things? or the spirit of fig=\r\nhting? or the sense of enjoyment? etc), one Mahavidya may be more suitable =\r\nthan others, as that knowledge uses your strong aspect and moulds that aspe=\r\nct to take you towards liberation. Do not compare them. Take the one that i=\r\ns most suitable, but do master that aspect.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere a=\r\nre some who do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana by doing one Mahavidya&#39;s mantra for o=\r\nne month, then switch to another and so on. They think that by doing each m=\r\nahavidya mantra for a certain count, they &quot;finish&quot; the mahavidya sadhana. T=\r\nhis is wrong and serves no useful purpose. Instead, one should pick any ONE=\r\n mahavidya and succeed in that sadhana. The definition of success is that t=\r\nhe knowledge represented by that deity becomes part of your common sense - =\r\nyou understand that knowledge and ooze that knowledge in your thoughts and =\r\nactions. Whether you experience the deity as an external human-like form (w=\r\nho may impart some knowledge to you) or as an internal human-like form or a=\r\ns light or as sound is secondary, but the end result should be that the kno=\r\nwledge represented by Her should become common sense and second nature to y=\r\nou. One claiming visions or siddhi of a mahavidya but not showing the corre=\r\nsponding knowledge is bluffing.\n \nThere are many people who do mahavidya sa=\r\ndhana and yet many others who claim to have siddhi in one or more mahavidya=\r\ns, but very few who actually possess any of the ten mahavidyas. The area of=\r\n mahavidya sadhana is one of the most ill-understood in today&#39;s age of igno=\r\nrance and half-baked knowledge. It is easier to possess lower vidyas or low=\r\ner shaktis, but mahavidyas are beyond the capability of understanding for m=\r\nost people.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------- \n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;naaraayan=\r\na_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: F=\r\nriday, June 05, 2009 9:58 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Rama as God\n \n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s what the Mundamala Tantra states (not in correc=\r\nt itrans format):\n&gt;\n&gt; kriShnaastu kaalika saakshaat raamamoortischa taariNi=\r\ni |\n&gt; vaaraaho bhuvana prokta nrsimho bharavishvarii ||\n&gt; dhoomavatii vaman=\r\naH syaat chinnaa bhrighukulodbhavaAH |\n&gt; kamalaa matsyaroopaAH syaat koorma=\r\nstu bagalamukhii ||\n&gt; maatangii baudh ityeSHa Shodashii kalkiroopinii ||\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Some of the reason for the mapping given is:\n&gt;\n&gt; Varaha as the boar that =\r\ndug deep to uplift Mother Earth (Bhuvaneshvari)\n&gt; Bhairavi is the burning t=\r\napas of that shoots forth and destroys all evil \n&gt; but not to aspirants (li=\r\nke Narasimha deva being kind to Prahalada)\n&gt; Parasurama cut the head of his=\r\n mother Renuka (Chinnamasta)\n&gt; Kamalatmika robed in the waters of conscious=\r\nness is behind the Matsya the \n&gt; primordial fish in the vivifying waters of=\r\n creation.\n&gt; Bagalamukhi is stifling force of Kurma avtara that lies still =\r\nand \n&gt; motionless withdrawing its limbs into itself.\n&gt; Matangi is the Vaikh=\r\nari Vak behind the avatara of Buddha who had come to \n&gt; articulate the mess=\r\nage of truth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
