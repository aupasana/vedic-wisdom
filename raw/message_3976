Even if by some luck, through a confl=\r\nuence of various factors, mind becomes &#39;satisfied&#39;, it is usually not for l=\r\nong.\n&gt; \n&gt; the following is a repost of the simplest procedure that Narasimh=\r\na posted a while back\n&gt; \n&gt; Materials needed: Homa kundam, wooden/copper/ si=\r\nlver \n&gt; spoon/ladle, melted ghee and pieces of dried coconut (or wood or dr=\r\nied cowdung \n&gt; cakes).\n&gt;  \n&gt; (0) Sit facing east and place homa kundam in f=\r\nront \n&gt; of you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) Place some dried coconut pieces or wood or \n&gt; dri=\r\ned cowdung cake pieces in homa kundam (fire pit).\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Light a camphor=\r\n and place it in the homa kundam \n&gt; while saying &quot;om bhuurbhuvassuvarom&quot; an=\r\nd make sure that the pieces placed \n&gt; in homa kundam catch fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) =\r\nPour ghee drops with a wooden/copper/ silver \n&gt; spoon/ladle in the fire whi=\r\nle saying the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; om prajaapataye svaahaa\n&gt; om indraaya svaaha=\r\na\n&gt; om agnaye svaahaa\n&gt; om somaaya svaahaa\n&gt; om bhuurbhuvassuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; (4) Thinking of Ganesha in your mind, pour ghee \n&gt; drops in fire while =\r\nsaying the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; om gam gaNapa=\r\ntaye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; om gam gaNapataye na=\r\nmaH \n&gt; svaahaa \n&gt; (5) Pick any deity and any mantra. Thinking of the \n&gt; dei=\r\nty of the mantra, pour ghee drops (or any other valid offering - see manual=\r\n) \n&gt; while saying the mantra. Just add svaahaa at the end of the mantra. If=\r\n the \n&gt; mantra already has a svaahaa at the end, there is no need to add on=\r\ne more \n&gt; svaahaa.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is also fine to pick a collection of verses \n&gt; =\r\n(e.g. Vishnu sahasra naama stotram, Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram, =\r\n\n&gt; Lalita sahasra naama stotram, Aditya hridayam, Subrahmanyashtakam etc). =\r\nAt the \n&gt; end of each verse, add svaahaa and make an offering in fire. When=\r\n the stotram \n&gt; ends, you can go back to the beginning and repeat.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do=\r\n this for as much time as you want to. But make \n&gt; sure that you do this st=\r\nep for atleast 10-15 minutes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (6) When you are done, pour ghee drops =\r\nin fire \n&gt; while saying the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; om bhuuH svaahaa\n&gt; om bhuvaH s=\r\nvaahaa\n&gt; om suvaH svaahaa\n&gt; om bhuurbhuvassuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; om shrii viShNave=\r\n svaahaa\n&gt; om namo rudraaya pashupataye svaahaa\n&gt;  \n&gt; (7) Try to surrender =\r\nyour mind as completely to god \n&gt; as you can. Sit absolutely still and medi=\r\ntate for a few minutes with any \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Done!\n&gt; \n&gt; if one can acce=\r\npt that mind may never be satisfied even with the most elaborate procedure =\r\nwith the finest materials, then it may be possible to experience the undilu=\r\nted essence of this worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Ajaya\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NAMASKAR=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I seeks help on regarding this topic...may Rajarshi, Krishnendu, =\r\nArnab, Utpal or anyone please take my issue...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; best regards,\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\niswajit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PRANAM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Narasimha Ji and Others=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes a trim down version is very useful for me when the=\r\nre is time constraint for daily Ganapati Homam...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently th=\r\ne short-procedure takes about 45 minutes for me, yes I know there is a supe=\r\nr-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sanskrit-verse and sometimes =\r\nmind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, could you pl=\r\nease suggest/mark the various steps with important Mantras on priority basi=\r\ns on the short-procedure of the Ganapati Homam, so that one could trim down=\r\n the homam process in the case of time constraint but mind should be satisf=\r\ny enough for the purpose...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Biswajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
