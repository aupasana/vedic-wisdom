Thought I would share it =\r\nwith you as he suggests a rather nice practical technique to increase God r=\r\nememberance that might suit some of you (The &quot;child of God&quot; exercise in par=\r\nticular).  \n\nExcerpts from Swami Omkarananda&#39;s article &quot;The shortest way to=\r\n God experience&quot;:\n\n&quot;Let your heart constantly beat with the thought, &#39;God, =\r\nGod, God&#39;, God all the twenty-four hours of the day, God as Love, God as Li=\r\nght, God as Omnipotence, God as Omniscience, God as Peace, God as unlimited=\r\n Happiness, God as infinite Blessedness, God as an all-seeing Presence, God=\r\n as an all-loving Father, God as an indestructible, eternal, absolute Truth=\r\n, God as Beauty, Protection, Strength. Let your heart constantly beat with =\r\nthese words. This is the shortest way to God-Experience.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you greet so=\r\nmeone, greet God in that someone. If you sleep, feel the bed to be the Hear=\r\nt of God. If you are about to eat something, first offer it to God, mentall=\r\ny, and take it as a service to God, as an adoration of God, as a duty you o=\r\nwe to God by maintaining the body in order that, through the body, you may =\r\nmake spiritual progress.&quot;\n\nAN EXERCISE: &quot;I am a child of God&quot;\n\n&quot;One of the =\r\nmost wonderful ways of God-experience in daily life, is to constantly tell =\r\nyour heart, &#39;I am a child of God&#39;. Again and again, let your whole being, y=\r\nour entire soul, affirm, &#39;I am a child of God. God is all around me. I am i=\r\nn God even as everyone and everything is in God. God is in me, even as God =\r\nis in everyone and in everything&#39;.&quot;\n\n&quot;God has endowed you with endless inne=\r\nr spiritual qualities, by forming you in His own living Image of divine Con=\r\nsciousness. Displace human hatred by His divine Love, displace human worry =\r\nby the divine Strength. As an inspiring, joy-giving, brave, blessed child o=\r\nf God be thou, here in this difficult world.&quot;\n\n&quot;This fact that you are a ch=\r\nild of God is the greatest truth. Upon it rest all other truths. It is the =\r\ntruth of truths.&quot;\n\n&quot;That you are a child of matter, or a creature of nature=\r\n, is not the central truth: it is merely a temporary fact, which is constan=\r\ntly altering its face and will soon disappear as the bubble on the sea. Mat=\r\nter is changing, therefore, your material body too is changing, so are your=\r\n thoughts and feelings changing. The Breath of God in you, the Light in you=\r\n as the child of God, does not change. It is the same in all conditions and=\r\n at all times. It is the imperishable and all-wonderful Substance of God in=\r\n you. Matter perishes. The real child of God in you, which is your real, et=\r\nernal, inner divine Self and Being, which is the wonderful &#39;You&#39;, does not =\r\nperish. Therefore, always permit your inner heart to say, &#39;I am a child of =\r\nGod.&#39; Breathe, and bless the world with the treasures of your good works, a=\r\ns a child of God.&quot;\n\nThe full article is worth a read \n\nhttp://www.omkaranan=\r\nda-ashram.org/Publications/shortest_way_to_god.htm\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n\n"}}
