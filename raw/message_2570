However i perform chandi Homam occasional=\r\nly.\n\nRegarding your query of switching from Ganapati Homam to some other ho=\r\nmam, i can only say that it depends upon individual. once can have strong i=\r\nntuition/urge to switch to some other deity. some people might get indirect=\r\n or direct indications. i do not know about the criteria to fix a time fram=\r\ne for switch. peronally for me, i am not having any such urge/intuition/ind=\r\nications till date and i have left it to my guru to suggest if at all there=\r\n needs a shift from Ganapati Homam to some other homam (say Chandi Homam). =\r\nhowever, i must say that i&#39;ve liking towards Chandi homa.\n\nwarm regards,\nUt=\r\npal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Anup Ray &lt;aray_usa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Dear Pathakbhai,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you please mention how long after your Ganapat=\r\ni homam did you move to Chandi path?
