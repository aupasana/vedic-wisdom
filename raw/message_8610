And there is no dearth of suffering on this planet, an=\r\nd no lack of opportunity to serve.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n]\n\nSeek forgiveness of all befo=\r\nre hand if I will be looking biased or boring for what i am going to put do=\r\nwn in this long message.\n\nSince 2 days I am in endless discussions (Satsang=\r\n as i will call it) with a like minded individual because we have holidays =\r\nhere and our families are out in India. Yesterday, After Havan we were agai=\r\nn discussing on Spiritual Giants such as Sain Baba, Meherbaba, Vimalananda,=\r\n Ramakrishna and about various Sadhanas and to be in hurry to put in practi=\r\nce etc... etc... Our discussion turned finally to India&#39;s condition and Sar=\r\ndar Vallabhbhai Patel. We talked about him, remembered him for almost 4 hou=\r\nrs without a break when suddenly we saw that It was 2 am! i left his home a=\r\nnd came to my home, feeling myself completely overewhelmed by my Sardar Pat=\r\nel. PratH Smaraniya! I could not sleep and kept remembering him surfing for=\r\n him on the net and rejoicing and celebrating his personality and Karmayoga=\r\n....Sheer Karmyoga!!!\n\nIf somebody has patience and gratitude enough to rem=\r\nember one of the real Sons of India, one can go through this matter of fact=\r\n article about him which i came across yesterday:\n\nhttp://www.dadinani.com/=\r\ncapture-memories/read-contributions/major-events-pre-1950/218-my-memories-o=\r\nf-sardar-patel-by-r-c-mody\n\n\nYesterday only I was telling my friend that I =\r\nrespect, love and admire Sardar Patel not less then even likes of Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramhamsa, Vivekananda and such few. We discussed his Karma Yoga. livin=\r\ng every moment of his extremely valuable life for his countrymen without ex=\r\npecting any reward. Unparalleled Political sacrifice by leaving opportunity=\r\n to become 1st Prime Minister of Modern india.  \n\nWhenever Karma Yoga comes=\r\n in Mind - 2 Individual unfailingly comes to my mind - Swami Vivekananda an=\r\nd Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Off course there are and will be few others, le=\r\nss famous or not at all famous but these 2 Karmayogis are the heroes who ha=\r\nve positively affected life of the entire Nation.\n\nYES! Karmayoga is extrem=\r\nely difficult path (Real Karma Yoga).\n\n***\nHowever, in the same breath I wi=\r\nsh to put some personal thoughts in which i have conviction. I have always =\r\ninstinctively believed that the most important thing is to *purify one self=\r\n and build the character*. One is bound to serve fellow human being in the =\r\nbest way only when he or she has purified his/herself and built personal ch=\r\naracter. we all know about Swami Vivekananda and his ruthless pursuit to pu=\r\nrify himself by Sadhana in his early years. Although Sardar Patel was not t=\r\nhat Religious in popular sense, his entire life is living example of Purifi=\r\ncation and building a character which is ready to conclude a Gigantic, near=\r\n impossible task of Unifying and forging India.\n\nwhen one has built up char=\r\nacter (i.e. controlled all Shadripus and developed justness, compassion and=\r\n such high virtues), one would be then chosen by Mother Nature to serve man=\r\ny many people. it does not mean though that one does not serve fellow human=\r\n being till one is purified enough. Both are simultaneous processes. You th=\r\nink about others selflessly, do good to people as much as you can, develop =\r\ncompassion to all creatures and side by side do Sadhana to purify yourself.=\r\n But if absolute choice is given then I would stick to Sadhana (Say Japa, H=\r\navana etc...) because of a firm belief that I must purify myself, built up =\r\nthe most important thing called character, come to a point wherein My ego i=\r\ns reduced to bare minimum, come to a point where Shadripus have been annihi=\r\nlated or completely controlled and then I know that if I have a desire left=\r\n for serving humanity then Mother Nature would surely use me as a tool in h=\r\ner hand to server Humanity and that would be then real Karma Yoga! That wou=\r\nld be real good to all fellow human being. However, for all practical purpo=\r\nse, I must do Sadhana and at the same time think about others well being, w=\r\nork for others well being as selflessly as possible!\n\nI agree with Dinesh w=\r\nhen he said :&quot;People love to preach\nand pontificate, and in all likelihood =\r\nthey have no *real* experience of what they are talking about and are indul=\r\nging in, well, intellectual &lt;insert-the-verb-here&gt;.&quot;\n\nYes, at least now, of=\r\nf late, i have understood that it is not at all right to preach what i do n=\r\not follow or do not have any personal experiences. that is why, for me now =\r\none thing what matters most is Sadhana, Sadhana and Saa-dhanaa. incidentall=\r\ny, I was pushing my friend, very hard to start a serious Sadhana and not to=\r\n be fascinated by spiritual Books and philosophical materials. He is a nobl=\r\ne soul devoted to Sain-baba. Finally he decided to start Gayatri Japa Sadha=\r\nna since today Morning - on the Ground of 5 &quot;S&quot; indicated by Vimalananda.\n\n=\r\nMay Jagadamba, the Adya Shakti, creates many more purified Souls who then u=\r\nsed by her as Karma Yogis of Highest order because we all see that How much=\r\n badly they are required!!!\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Vivekananda h=\r\nas some interesting thoughts on the subject of serving our fellow human bei=\r\nngs. \n&gt; \n&gt; He says! \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do you love your fellow men? Where should you go=\r\n to seek for God -- are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, Gods? Wh=\r\ny not worship them first? Believe in the omnipotent power of love. Have you=\r\n love?-- you are omnipotent.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Look upon every man, woman, and every o=\r\nne as God. You cannot help anyone, you can only serve: serve the children o=\r\nf the Lord, serve the Lord Himself, if you have the privilege. If the Lord =\r\ngrants that you can help any one of his children, blessed you are; do not t=\r\nhink too much of yourselves. Blessed you are that that privilege was given =\r\nto you when others had it not. Do it only as a worship. I should see God in=\r\n the poor, and it is for my salvation that I go and worship them. The poor =\r\nand the miserable are for our salvation, so that we may serve the Lord, com=\r\ning in the shape of the diseased, coming in the shape of the lunatic, the l=\r\neper, and the sinner!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vivekananda&#39;s ideal is a great one, but I find,=\r\n no easy task. Japa is pleasant. But karma yoga, serving people of all sort=\r\ns....sometimes ungrateful, angry, even dangerous people...with love is one =\r\nheck of a challenge. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is just one remarkable example of wonderful=\r\n karma yoga. I&#39;m sure there are many other people who do this, without labe=\r\nlling themselves spiritual. This chap risks his life daily in a war-torn zo=\r\nne for the sake of others. Wish I had half his courage. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.bb=\r\nc.co.uk/news/magazine-17314391 \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess the acid test of spiritual pro=\r\ngress is how much we do for others. If I do japa all day, while the man nex=\r\nt to me is sick and starving, I doubt God would be impressed. Japa cleans t=\r\nhe mind. The fruit of japa surely has to be a burning desire to serve human=\r\nity. And there is no dearth of suffering on this planet, and no lack of opp=\r\nortunity to serve. \n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t think it matters whether or not we see fancy=\r\n visions in meditation, or hear &#39;anahata sounds&#39; or anything else. All that=\r\n stuff is great I guess, but if it&#39;s not accompanied by a burning desire to=\r\n relieve the miseries of our fellow men/women, it probably ain&#39;t worth anyt=\r\nhing much. \n&gt; \n&gt; We all talk about meditation and japa....karma yoga is not=\r\n so fun, but just as vital. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, at least, Vivekananda seems to thin=\r\nk so anyway! I&#39;ve got a long way to go before I reach his ideal of a karma =\r\nyogi....hope you guys are doing better than me! \n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with your k=\r\narma yoga eveyone. :) \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
