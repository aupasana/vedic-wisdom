Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various=\r\n agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. P=\r\nurusha is the witness of it all.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Though each karma should give k=\r\narmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver=\r\n the karmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balanci=\r\nng act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). Th=\r\nere are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas =\r\nand picking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; At any time, some k=\r\narmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this l=\r\nife&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot;=\r\n pool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime s=\r\noon. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the=\r\n balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The ass=\r\nignment and ordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one en=\r\ngages in various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new peopl=\r\ne enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents an=\r\nd sequencing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As one engages in remedial measures such as praye=\r\nrs, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vu=\r\nlnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including pla=\r\nnets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who=\r\n operate through other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). The=\r\n karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be=\r\n downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. O=\r\nr, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in o=\r\nrder within the same pool.\n&gt; =C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with=\r\n sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thing can ha=\r\nppen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Every a=\r\nction by one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange on=\r\ne&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a ka=\r\nrma that was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense a=\r\ns the karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with=\r\n small force, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a spe=\r\ncific result, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what ri=\r\ntual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in t=\r\nheir optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in th=\r\neir optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can of=\r\nten make some difference.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This point is well illustrated by the =\r\n&quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of o=\r\nne&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may s=\r\nhow favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect o=\r\nf God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God=\r\n is the power that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balance =\r\nand order within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in H=\r\ner eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She admi=\r\nnisters just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using available age=\r\nnts.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipe=\r\nline and will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with t=\r\nhem, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most import=\r\nant thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply=\r\n put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad=\r\n karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to =\r\nothers are good karmas.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-ex=\r\nisting pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and=\r\n current action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available i=\r\nn shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each actio=\r\nn. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to b=\r\ne commensurate with the karma itself.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You need only small force =\r\nto push a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituali=\r\nty Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;____=\r\n____________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:2=\r\n9 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;De=\r\nar=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special e=\r\nlephant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus=\r\n, it was possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose kar=\r\nma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the k=\r\narma of the ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karm=\r\na of the beggar turned king.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Everything is interrelated. The beg=\r\ngar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one=\r\n chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the =\r\nelephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in =\r\nsuch a kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa=\r\n&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are fo=\r\nr the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the day=\r\n, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their tap=\r\nas shakti through speech.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When it comes to people and their karm=\r\nic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that there is a perso=\r\nn, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come=\r\n&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone to come and remove =\r\nall the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches=\r\n us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. An=\r\nd you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other wo=\r\nrds, your vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaas=\r\nanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier said than don=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any mo=\r\nment when your mind becomes agitated is a curse.

I vague=\r\nly remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghor=\r\na trilogy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; s=\r\nay from a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Ru=\r\ndraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80&quot; what do this it=\r\nems really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for pl=\r\nanets =E2=80&quot; do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maha=\r\nrashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot =\r\nchange `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri G=\r\nuru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has o=\r\nnly readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not =\r\nexact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memor=\r\ny]. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great ext=\r\nent or it is just our perception that changes?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanking you,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Digamb=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
