Raajasik \nscriptures are for people who are mostly raajasik. Taamasik scriptures are \nfor people who still have a good amount of tamas in them.\n\nOne will be wrong to assume that this implies supriority of one scripture \nover another or one god over another.\n\nA teacher who teaches a class of dull and dumb-witted people is not \nnecessarily inferior to a teacher who teaches a class of people who are \nsmart and fast. They just need different qualities and do different jobs. \nTeaching a dumb person and making him get good marks needs different \nqualities compared to teaching a smart person. Please note that the goal of \npeople in either class is the same - to study well and pass the exam with \nvery good marks. People in either class can achieve the goal if they listen \nto their respective teachers well.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 26, 2009 2:04 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Corruption of scriptures\n\n\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently someone refered me to a sloka from the Padma Purana which goes \n&gt; this way:\n&gt;\n&gt; Padma Purana:\n&gt;\n&gt; shAstrANyapi cha sarvANi trividhAni mahAmate ||\n&gt; yAni satyavaraM viShNuM vadanti parameshvaram.h |\n&gt; tAni shAstrANi sarvANi sAtvikAni matAni vai ||\n&gt; prajApatiM kR^ishAnuM cha tathA devIM sarasvatIm.h |\n&gt; paratvena vadachChAstraM rAjasaM parichaxate ||\n&gt; yachChAstraM liN^gapAramyaM vAmadevamumApatim.h |\n&gt; tamaH pravartakaM vakti tattAmasamudAhR^itam.h ||\n&gt;\n&gt; All Shastras are of three types. That Shastra which praises Lord Vishnu as \n&gt; Parameshvara is Satvika. That which praises Brahma or Agni or Sarasvati \n&gt; Devi is Rajasika. That which praises Shiva, since it leads to Tamas, is \n&gt; Tamasika shAstra\n&gt;\n&gt; Why are the Puranas classified as Satwik, Rajasik and Tamasic? Is this a \n&gt; contradiction to say teh Linga Puran which exhalts Shiva? Or, over time, \n&gt; did the scriptures get corrupted by people of various sects within Sanatan \n&gt; Dharma?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
