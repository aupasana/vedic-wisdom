I pray you are =\r\nable to continue this forever.\n\nYou can do ahooti for any diety, provided y=\r\nou start with the ahooti of the pradhaan/main diety. Rest all is OK. Also, =\r\nwe need to add svaahaa at the end of the mantra even if it has namah in it =\r\n... like om namah shivaaya would become om namah shivaaya svaahaa.\n\nDoing a=\r\nhooti for Kula/Graama deva/devi is an excellent idea and I do it too. Infac=\r\nt you might want to remember them (along with your parents/and the rishi wh=\r\no originated your gotra) when you start the homam procedure, but right afte=\r\nr Shuklambhara dharam mantra, which one utters at the start of the homam pr=\r\nocedure.\n\nHope this helps.\n-Narayan-\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt;   First of=\r\n all,thankyou very much for this &#39;Bare minimum homam procedure.&#39;I finally s=\r\ntarted doing homam on Narsimha jayanti day as i could somehow not start on =\r\nAkshay Tritiya.I have now done homam two days in a row, and it has been a v=\r\nery fulfilling experience,esp. the first time.\n&gt;   The mantra i did homam w=\r\nas Gayatri mantra.I have one query here-\n&gt; I did homam for around 10 mins.B=\r\nut i did not count,ie. i  do not know as to how many mantras i did as i was=\r\n not using a mala,is it alright?or should i be counting and doing --say one=\r\n whole mala?\n&gt;   Also, as it was Narsimha jayanti the first day,i gave 5 aa=\r\nhutis for Narsimha,and on the second day,it being Kurma jayanti, i offered =\r\nfor Kurma devta.\n&gt;   On both days, i offered a few aahutis for Kuldevi,Laks=\r\nhmiNarayan and UmaMaheshwar---is that ok,Or should i be doing homam with on=\r\nly one mantra?Also,i used &#39;svaha&#39; after the mantra without namah,i hope i d=\r\nid right\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you once again,\n&gt; Sunita.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
