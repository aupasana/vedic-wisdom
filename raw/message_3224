Now some points:\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nBut I have often feel that they are themselves are not convin=\r\nced when they argue. they are &#39;hollow&#39; arguments. However , I&#39;ll honestly s=\r\nay that i have no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n\nWhen I used to eat non-ve=\r\ngetarian food many of my friends who were=C2=A0vegetarian people would give=\r\n me a similar logic, as you mentioned in your first writing. My point is, a=\r\ns a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to=\r\n plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C2=A0 this logic that m=\r\nany vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit ea=\r\nting non-veg, does not hold good.\n=C2=A0\nI personally can not look at butch=\r\nery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their=\r\n excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and t=\r\nhen take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or =\r\na Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook =\r\nthe voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a di=\r\nsturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to descr=\r\nibe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is s=\r\no tasty.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nI understand and appreciate you feelings, but I pers=\r\nonally do not share them. Call me cruel hearted. \n=C2=A0\nWhen the question =\r\nof sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is mos=\r\nlty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may no=\r\nt affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0=\r\n\nSome of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel where th=\r\ney showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends se=\r\nemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, w=\r\nhat is wrong=C2=A0if someone eats an insect. Just because one is born in a =\r\ncertain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one gets the b=\r\nelieve that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if=\r\n in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they would gladl=\r\ny keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans =\r\nare incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinion is all r=\r\night. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are the only pos=\r\nsible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others s=\r\nhare similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse=\r\n, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a\n vegetaria=\r\nn in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/family in a later lifeti=\r\nme which=C2=A0eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid wh=\r\nile eating the same. I know=C2=A0people who faint at the sight of blood, bu=\r\nt there are doctors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, perso=\r\nnal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C2=A0ca=\r\nnnot be=C2=A0a universal logic applicable to all.\n=C2=A0\nA far better angle=\r\n of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure=\r\n he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be ki=\r\nlled, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handle=\r\nd easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C2=A0does not want to deal=\r\n in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount o=\r\nf karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily =\r\nhandled.=C2=A0It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple=\r\n daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who ha=\r\ns cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions=\r\n in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - b=\r\nroiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten be=\r\ncause they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What kar=\r\nma does one get for consuming that? God knows.\n=C2=A0\nAn average non-vegeta=\r\nrian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His stapl=\r\ne diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg.=\r\n From a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who fe=\r\ned on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to =\r\nserious heath issues at a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biolo=\r\ngically good.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be ful=\r\nl of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaff=\r\nordable if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not,=\r\n put up such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they are themsel=\r\nves not convinced.\n\n\nThe above arguments are incorrect. I know some non-veg=\r\netarian people who provide such arguements,=C2=A0 but these arguments=C2=A0=\r\nare nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of arguments.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nAnyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally=C2=A0veget=\r\narian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans,=C2=A0o=\r\nr else it conflicts with your system badly. \n=C2=A0\nBut to say that it is=\r\n=C2=A0 immoral or that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetaria=\r\nn food, is illogical, incorrect and pure bunkum.I know a devotee of Krishna=\r\n - not just a devotee but one who sees Krishna=C2=A0during his=C2=A0meditat=\r\nions and have experienced samadhi many times over, who is=C2=A0omnivorous.=\r\n=C2=A0For any average person, not engaging himself/herself in specific sadh=\r\nanas, I see no harm in having an omnivorous diet with a 80/20 vegetarian/no=\r\nn-vegetarian combination. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nThe upsu=\r\nrge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Fri, 11/12/09, ved=\r\nic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_patha=\r\nk@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

A person who is a\n vegetarian in this lif=\r\ne, if he gets born in a place/culture/family in a later lifetime which&nbsp=\r\n;eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating th=\r\ne same. I know&nbsp;people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are d=\r\noctors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivi=\r\nty can be a very good reason for an individual, but it&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;=\r\na universal logic applicable to all.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A far bet=\r\nter angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can =\r\nmake sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal=\r\n to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can =\r\nbe handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)&nbsp;does not wan=\r\nt to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The=\r\n amount of karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can b=\r\ne easily handled.&nbsp;It is similar to the one you would get for buying so=\r\nme simple daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle m=\r\nan who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repu=\r\nrcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some=\r\n eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be=\r\n eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth.=\r\n What karma does one get for consuming that? God\n knows.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;An average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is a=\r\nctually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pu=\r\nlses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a=\r\n good combination. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in =\r\ntheir staple diet, are prone to serious heath issues at a younger age. But =\r\nthis 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biologically good.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be full of f=\r\nishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordabl=\r\ne if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not, put u=\r\np such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they are themselves no=\r\nt convinced.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above arguments are incorrect. I k=\r\nnow some non-vegetarian people who provide such arguements,&nbsp; but these=\r\n arguments&nbsp;are nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of ar=\r\nguments.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, my point is, I understand tha=\r\nt it is good to eat totally&nbsp;vegetarian food when you engage in sadhana=\r\n, specially things like havans,&nbsp;or else it conflicts with your system =\r\nbadly. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But to say that it is&nbsp; immoral or=\r\n that one does not reach God if one consumes non-vegetarian food, is illogi=\r\ncal, incorrect and pure bunkum.I know a devotee of Krishna - not just a dev=\r\notee but one who sees Krishna&nbsp;during his&nbsp;meditations and have exp=\r\nerienced samadhi many times over, who is&nbsp;omnivorous.&nbsp;For any aver=\r\nage person, not engaging himself/herself in specific sadhanas, I see no har=\r\nm in having an omnivorous diet with a 80/20 vegetarian/non-vegetarian combi=\r\nnation. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of=\r\n consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 11/12/09, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;=\r\nvedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-=\r\nLEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fro=\r\nm: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: Veg Vs.

However , I&#39;ll honestly say that i have no answers for &#39;l=\r\nife in a Plant&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The people who argue such as&#39;: Most eat meat in the=\r\n world, Egg is vegetarian, Plant also has life, One will not get required n=\r\nourishments only with vegetarian food, If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will b=\r\ne full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become =\r\nunaffordable if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than=\r\n not, put up such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they are th=\r\nemselves not convinced.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vegeterian people have their own arguments b=\r\nut all these are mere arguments. I personally can not look at butchery shop=\r\ns where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their excitem=\r\nents\n stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then tak=\r\ne away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat =\r\nor a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voi=\r\nce of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbin=\r\ng site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe the=\r\n condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bottom line is that &quot;They cannot overcome&quot; the cravings for th=\r\ne meat, fish and eggs. This is a naked reality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Rajarshi, Howev=\r\ner i try, i am not convinced with arguments in favour of Nonveg food. Only =\r\nat the cold places and deserts where survival was the main consideration, i=\r\n can slightly agree but that too during ancient days. not now...Now everywh=\r\nere Veg food is easily available.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;***&lt;BR&gt;Few months back, a young gi=\r\nrl from Germany came to work in my office for 6 months. once i casually\n as=\r\nked her as to what she eats during lunch. what she said was not at all expe=\r\ncted. she said that she is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg food since 3 y=\r\nears now and wants to continue that way whole life. As expected, i was very=\r\n happy and i further asked the reason. The answer she gave so much happines=\r\ns. She said that She does not want to kill to eat. Vow!
