This is regarding the metion of Sri Yukteshwar=\r\n \nGiris calculations of the yugas.\n\nFirstly let me clarify that I personall=\r\ny am no vedic scholar, nor \ncan I read sanskrit. So I really have no idea o=\r\nf what or who is \nright. But I had the good fortune of reading the book &quot;Th=\r\ne Holy \nScience&quot; where he refers to this calcuation of yugas. Now you must =\r\n\nhave read in th autobiography of a yogi that Sri Lahiri Mahasaya had \ninst=\r\nructed Sri Yukteshwar Giri to go to the Kumb Mela so that he \ncould meet th=\r\ne Mahamauni. And later after Sri Yukteshwar Giri \nMaharaj had completed his=\r\n book, that very day he met the Mahamauni \nwho was sitting under a tree wit=\r\nh his disciples. Infact the incident \ngoes this way that as the Mahamauni h=\r\nad promised Yukteshwar Giri \nthat he would meet him once the book get writt=\r\nen. So as Sri \nYukteshwar Giri was passing by in the morning to take a bath=\r\n \nsuddenly he finds the Mahamauni with his disciples under a tree. And \nthe=\r\n first thing that the Mahamauni tells Sri Yukteshwar giri is to \nto bring p=\r\nerfection in his vision by increasing his meditation \nbecause had he done s=\r\no he should have been able to see Him(the \nMahamauni) and his disciple insi=\r\nde the sunlight. Anyway that is \nbeside the point.\nWhat I was wondering is =\r\nthat, if the calculation of yugas as given \nby Sri Yukteshwar is wrong then=\r\n that means even the Mahamauni Babaji \nblessing the book and meeting him in=\r\n kumb and again later is also \nwrong. I mean all these people are way way w=\r\nay way ahead of me, but \neven among them Mahamauni is just not another sadh=\r\naka or a yogi. He \nis the Babaji. As Lahiri Mahasay mentions in his dairy.&quot;=\r\nbudhe babai \nkisun hai&quot;.. Lahiri Mahasay used to refer to Babaji as budhe b=\r\naba. \nAnd Kisun was Krishna. To think that, THAT supersoul specifically \nbl=\r\nessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong \ncalcuation b=\r\necomes a little difficult to comprehend. \nI of my own have no knowledge or =\r\nlearning to be able to decide what \nis right and what is not. I just voiced=\r\n a concern of mine from the \npoint of view of an ordinary individual who co=\r\nnsiders the Mahamauni \nto be one with God himself. If He is can make such a=\r\n mistake, then \nGod is not really that omnipotent I guess.\n\n-Regards\n Rajar=\r\nshi\n \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

They are arranged in their \ncurrent form by \n&gt; Vyas=\r\na about 5,000 years back. But they were revealed to rishis \nmillions of \n&gt; =\r\nyears back. Yogis have been meditating on verses from Vedas and \nrealizing =\r\n\n&gt; universal truths represented by them for millions of years.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Why =\r\nmost of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, wasnt \nthere\n&gt; &gt; any =\r\nphilosophy before that?\n&gt; \n&gt; The modern chronology of Hindu scriptures was =\r\ncreated by people \nwith heavy \n&gt; biases and agendas. Darshanas are not a fe=\r\nw thousand of years old.\n&gt; \n&gt; We had Veda(s), vedanta, vedangas, darshanas =\r\netc for millions of \nyears.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -What is the divison of the ages(yugas).=\r\n Again there is a lot of\n&gt; &gt; confusion here as some say they are thousands =\r\nof years long but \nothers\n&gt; &gt; say millions of years long. Can you please ex=\r\nplain it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Krita/Sat yuga is 1,728,000 years long. Treta yuga is 1,296,=\r\n000 \nyears long. \n&gt; Dwapara yuga is 864,000 years long. Current Kali yuga s=\r\ntarted \nabout 5,000 \n&gt; years back and it is 432,000 years long.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yukesh=\r\nwar maharaj (guru of Paramahamsa Yogananda) took a different \nview, \n&gt; wher=\r\ne all the above numbers are divided by 360. He is a great yogi \nand \n&gt; belo=\r\nngs to a great lineage and I have the highest respect. But he \nis simply \n&gt;=\r\n wrong on this. A yogi can experience all times and spaces. In \nfact, time =\r\nis \n&gt; a very weird concept, even though it seems natural to us when we \nare=\r\n \n&gt; completely bound to this body in this particular space-time \ncontinuum.=\r\n When \n&gt; a yogi enters nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no space and time for \n=\r\nhim/her. \n&gt; The space-time continuum experienced by a yogi in different rea=\r\nlms \nof \n&gt; consciousness are different. I submit that Yukteshwar Maharaj ma=\r\nde \nsome \n&gt; mistake, either intentionally or unintentionally, in drawing \nc=\r\nonclusions \n&gt; from his experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; Traditionally, we mention the numb=\r\ner of years that passed since \nKali yuga \n&gt; started, at the start of every =\r\nritual. The number mentioned (about \n5,000 \n&gt; years) matches with the astro=\r\nnomical dating of Mahabharata. All \nthe \n&gt; astronomical combinations mentio=\r\nned by Vyasa in Mahabharata \noccurred in that \n&gt; sequence in a consistent m=\r\nanner about 5,000 years back. There were \ntens of \n&gt; those eventsand they o=\r\nccurred in that sequence only once in the \nlast 7,400 \n&gt; years. For sure, K=\r\nrishna lived about 5,000 years back and Kali \nyuga started \n&gt; then.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n-You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar \nincarnation).\n&gt; &gt; Ca=\r\nn you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real \nstory\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd is there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation. \nAlso\n&gt; &gt; can=\r\n you please illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the stor=\r\nies of Puranas are metaphors of some internal \nhappenings and \n&gt; also real =\r\nstories at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each of is a microcosm of the entire univers=\r\ne. Thus, macro events \ndescribed \n&gt; in scriptures happen microcosmically in=\r\nside us. It is equally \nvalid to see \n&gt; them as real stories and as metapho=\r\nrs. When one&#39;s self-\nconsciousness ascends \n&gt; to a particular realm of cons=\r\nciousness, it is actually possible to \nsee one \n&gt; of these stories actually=\r\n happening. In our normal realm of \nconsciousness, \n&gt; these are just storie=\r\ns and we can only understand them \nintellectually.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are Jupiter, =\r\nhis wife Tara, Moon and Mercury externally. \nInternally, \n&gt; they represent =\r\nthe intelligence, the expression of intelligence, \nmind and \n&gt; learning abi=\r\nlity (respectively). The story of Jupiter&#39;s wife Tara \nbegetting \n&gt; a child=\r\n (Mercury) through Moon is real. It is also a metaphor for \nthe fact \n&gt; tha=\r\nt internally, mind combines with the expression of intelligence \nto \n&gt; gene=\r\nrate learning ability.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding Varaha avatara, here is my view. Hira=\r\nnya means gold and \nalso \n&gt; great. Aksha has many meanings, but one of them=\r\n is &quot;sense organs&quot;. \nThe demon \n&gt; Hiranyaksha symbolizes the mighty sense o=\r\nrgans. He stole Mother \nearth and \n&gt; sunk Her in water. Mother earth is sym=\r\nbolized by Kundalini \n&gt; (self-consciousness, microcosmic representation of =\r\nthe divine \nMother within \n&gt; each person) who is normally in the Mooladhara=\r\n chakra (earth \nelement). When \n&gt; a sadhaka is caught by the mighty sense o=\r\nrgans, Kundalini \n&gt; (self-consciousness) is stuck in the samsara saagara (t=\r\nhe ocean of \nmaterial \n&gt; life) and loses balance. Lord Vishnu (sattwa guna =\r\nin a person) \ntakes the \n&gt; form of a boar and comes from the nostril of the=\r\n creator. He digs \nin and \n&gt; rescues earth from Hiranyaksha. When sattwa gu=\r\nna enters the praana \n(life \n&gt; force - nostril reference) of a person, dive=\r\ns down to Mooladhara \nand \n&gt; destroys the attachment to the mighty sense or=\r\ngans there, the \nMother is \n&gt; freed and can move up to Merge with the Lord =\r\n(i.e. self-\nconsciousness \n&gt; ascending to merge with Brahman). Basically Va=\r\nraha avatara \nrepresents the \n&gt; sattwa guna in a person that tries to give =\r\ndetachment from the \nperceptions \n&gt; of the sense organs and then make the c=\r\nalm praana dives down to \nMooladhara \n&gt; to give balance to Kundalini to mov=\r\ne up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me h=\r\now \nis it\n&gt; &gt; going to affect my spiritual life. My fiancee&#39;s Birth Details=\r\n- \n02 Oct\n&gt; &gt; 1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with your marit=\r\nal life!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces from M=\r\narch \n2008\n&gt; &gt; to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it =\r\nis \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so i=\r\nf \nyou\n&gt; &gt; can explain me which one is correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; Drigdasa was taught in=\r\ncorrectly by some teachers earlier, based on \nwrongly \n&gt; remembered teachin=\r\ngs of tradition. Most softwares (including my \nown \n&gt; Jagannatha Hora softw=\r\nare) calculate it incorrectly. My personal \nversion of \n&gt; the software (to =\r\nbe released to the public later) calculates it \nbased on \n&gt; Parasara&#39;s teac=\r\nhings and I believe it to be correct based on my \nstudy of the \n&gt; charts of=\r\n several spiritualists. I taught it in the recent two \nissues of \n&gt; &quot;Jyotis=\r\nh Digest&quot; magazine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Next thing is about meditation, can you please a=\r\ndvise me any good\n&gt; &gt; meditation postures or any book where I can learn som=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t worry about technicalities too much. The most fundamental \nth=\r\ning is \n&gt; that your back and neck should be erect, straight and not tense a=\r\nt \nthe same \n&gt; time. You may sit on floor cross-legged preferably or even s=\r\nit in \na chair if \n&gt; you have weak knees. The most important thing is the b=\r\nack and neck \nbeing \n&gt; erect. Secondly, close the eyes, otherwise a lot of =\r\nfire is wasted \nin the \n&gt; act of seeing. That agni is better used for other=\r\n things! Then \nrepeat the \n&gt; mantra. If your focus is wandering elsewhere, =\r\ndon&#39;t panic and \nworry too \n&gt; much. Just bring back your mind to the mantra=\r\n. Try your best to \nfocus on the \n&gt; mantra. With time, you will succeed.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Finally remember - no effort is wasted. Even an effort that seems \nto be=\r\n not \n&gt; yielding results is actually working towards a final result. If a \n=\r\nstraw of \n&gt; the grass makes the scales tilt, it does not mean all the objec=\r\nts \nplaced on \n&gt; the scale previously were unneeded! Just have faith and ke=\r\nep doing \nsadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----=\r\n Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 17, 2008 4:22 AM\n&gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hari OM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste =\r\nNarasimha Ji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of all I would like to thank you for the illustr=\r\native and \nquick\n&gt; &gt; reply.

I have NOT read a more\n&gt; &gt; competent or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sublime co=\r\nmmentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is quite an \ninspired\n&gt; &gt; work. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; g=\r\nood English translation of this work is available at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://w=\r\nww.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-\nKripananda/dp/0911307648\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; opinion.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to come =\r\nwith \nhim to\n&gt; &gt; forest,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. I=\r\nn the presence of \nMaharshi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other =\r\nlearned people, \nMaharshi\n&gt; &gt; Vasishtha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all Up=\r\nanishats to Rama. His teachings \nwere\n&gt; &gt; captured\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by Valmiki and the =\r\nwork is known as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;.

And you people \nhave\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n helped me a lot to find out the right path at many times but \nnow i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n feel a bit lost again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart detai=\r\nls what brought me here( \nand to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I=\r\n still remember the thread \nwhere\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no=\r\n need to fear of Sani and \nnow i have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this thread and \nfrom=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make any \ndecisions o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are many\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone=\r\n(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and \nguide me i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will b=\r\ne very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date=\r\n- 17/03/1979\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punj=\r\nab), India\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading=\r\n some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there and doing \ns=\r\nome\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this was random and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nunplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my \nspiritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of \nreading more to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from \nwhere to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Ma=\r\nhaganapathi Homam on a \nregular\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Mater=\r\nials Needed except the \nhoma kundam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live=\r\n in Australia so can anyone \ntell me\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can no=\r\nt even dig a pit in the ground.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many ot=\r\nher things i want to ask but if \nsomeone\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these=\r\n i would be very thankful to him \nand i will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
