It&#39;s always great to know what people have actually experience=\r\nd. I do feel I appreciate the colours in nature these days. I tend to feel =\r\na sense of awe and respect for the Intelligence that made it all...much mor=\r\ne than I used to previously. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a coincidence but it&#39;s true=\r\n I notice these colours more since starting a regular japa practice. Could =\r\nthis be &#39;heightened&#39; sensory perception, I don&#39;t know. Personally, I put it=\r\n down to God blessing me with the ability to appreciate his extraordinary c=\r\nreation. The eye that sees these colours itself is an outrageously intricat=\r\ne intelligent creation, quite aside from all that it sees! All very amazing=\r\n really.\n\nRajarshiji, I agree life itself should be sadhana. That&#39;s what Br=\r\nother Lawrence (the chap who Practiced the Presence of God) thought too. It=\r\n was nice to be reminded that meditation is concentration plus contempation=\r\n. Does talking to God count as contemplation? One senior monk at the Sivana=\r\nnda Ashram in Rishikesh told me it was a kind of &#39;meditation&#39;. \n\nRakeshji, =\r\nmany thanks for the message. I am trying to remind myself of God within all=\r\n my patients (though I still forget from time to time). Working on it. I re=\r\nmind myself that God exists in the angry, aggressive, badtempered patients =\r\ntoo (that can be tricky!)....that tempers my annoyance with them, and I com=\r\nplain to Him...wow some of Your children are in a really bad mood today....=\r\n! Kindly help them, and also help me not to get mad at them! \nAbout repeati=\r\nng the mantra with the breath, I find this difficult because I find it chan=\r\nges my breathing. I make my breath longer to fit the mantra in and that doe=\r\nsn&#39;t work. I do try and repeat the mantra mentally whenever I remember thou=\r\ngh.\n\nOm Sri Krishnaya Namaha\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;shoonyakaya&quot; &lt;shoonyakaya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I totally agree with Vis=\r\nhal & Rajarshi... Even i started my sadhana with the same question in mind.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Follow rules or not, my take on it is follow your intuition. Then th=\r\ne question arises how to differentiate between intuition and wishful thinki=\r\nng? (even i am looking for an answer)\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not to follow rules?\n&gt; One m=\r\night not at all begin his/her sadhana thinking of rules. Sadhana has to be =\r\ntailored with the normal life till one finds a rythm and confidence. Then t=\r\nhe rules will be automatically followed based on the seriousness of the sad=\r\nhak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why to follow rules?\n&gt; As pointed out by Rajarshi, the chandipath=\r\n had so strict rules may be because of the following reason:\n&gt; 1. Some sadh=\r\nanas give immediate heightened awareness to the sadhak. It means they can s=\r\nmell, taste, hear and see better than normal. The world all of a sudden sta=\r\nrts looking beautiful.\n&gt; 2. They can visualize better the details of everyt=\r\nhing and every being and get lucid dreams.\n&gt; 3. Normal people are naturally=\r\n attracted to the sadhak because of his/her composure and grace and there i=\r\ns a beauty in the way they walk and talk that attracts\n&gt; \n&gt; The downfall:\n&gt;=\r\n Despite these changes, one thing would still remain...the &quot;Vasanas&quot; which =\r\nis a biggest obstacle to any sadhak. The normal world has many trigger poin=\r\nts for vasanas which would entice the sadhak and make him lose control over=\r\n his self. For a male sadhak women would look extraordinarily beautiful and=\r\n start dreaming about them. Their voice, their actions, their laughter woul=\r\nd haunt them day n night. Because people are attracted towards sadhak, it b=\r\noosts his ego and he/she forgets the very basic dharmas of life. All this i=\r\ns not the purpose of sadhana and hence the siddhas of past recommended secl=\r\nueded life which protects sadhaka from triggering the vasanas before he att=\r\nains maturity.\n&gt; The first 2 sadhanas (mentioned below)though very simple, =\r\ngave me the experience explained above (including the downfall).\n&gt; Self-awa=\r\nreness at every waking moment (sometimes sleeping moment also) becomes very=\r\n essential to prevent downfall. I cannot put in words the importance of swa=\r\ndhyava (self-study)and Ishvara pranidhana (surrender to divine)in this sens=\r\ne. Maybe mantra jap all day long is a good idea (as also suggested in Vigny=\r\nan Bhairava Tantra)\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhana Krama i followed:\n&gt; 1. jog for a kilometer=\r\n and do Sudarshana Kriya\n&gt; 2. jog for a kilometer or more and chant long OM=\r\n and contemplate on the after-silence\n&gt; 3. Jap of moolamantras of navagraha=\r\ns\n&gt; 4. Bandhas as given in Shiva Samhita\n&gt; 5. Sooryanamaskar and Gayathri S=\r\nahasranam Jap (current)\n&gt; \n&gt; The saying: An old patient is better than the =\r\nnew doctor. I have only presented my view (with some experience)even though=\r\n i am only a beginner in this path so your guidance will be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nm tat sat\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
