Ther=\r\ne is no concept of time or space or space-time continuum within non-dual se=\r\nlf. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of space or time or objec=\r\ntification.\n=A0\nSupreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non-du=\r\nality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the enti=\r\nre field of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time=\r\n continua within the field of duality exist within Him. From the perspectiv=\r\ne of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are His parts and a=\r\nll their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will. As all space-time c=\r\nontinua are within Him, there is nothing that is unknown to Him. Past, pres=\r\nent and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you and others, this possibi=\r\nlity, that possibility=A0and yet another possibility - all are accessible a=\r\nnd fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n=A0\nNow, let us come lower and into=\r\n the field of duality. The field of duality consists of infinite divisions =\r\nof space, time and space-time continua. There are infinite possibilities wi=\r\nthin this field.\n=A0\nNormally, people stuck deeply within duality have a li=\r\nnear sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. Ho=\r\nwever, field of duality also contains planes of consciousness where differe=\r\nnt senses of time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at =\r\nvarious points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time continuum i=\r\nn such a plane of consciousness=A0may experience a point of time that maps =\r\nto a future time in a regular space-time continuum being experienced by you=\r\n. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 year in anoth=\r\ner space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entity as one m=\r\nay think. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space-time cont=\r\ninua and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciousness that on=\r\ne&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a =\r\nspecific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality=\r\n. But relaity\n consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each=\r\n other. These are all different possibilities and you chart out your course=\r\n based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFrom the perspective of a yogi=\r\n who is in a different space-time continuum, your state may be known at a t=\r\nime that is in &quot;future&quot; as per the space-time continuum in which you exist.=\r\n But, from the perspective of the space-time continuum that you are in, you=\r\nr state at that future time is not yet known and depends on your current ac=\r\ntion.\n=A0\nIf a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state=\r\n in future, his observation is merely an observation and from his reference=\r\n frame.=A0It has no causal relationship to your current action or your futu=\r\nre state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen=\r\n. His observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover a=\r\nll the space-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the s=\r\npace-time pair where he observed you (if at all you do!).\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nLet us go further. Is there only one=\r\n future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you in space-time =\r\ncontinuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can your actions at=\r\n important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?\n=A0\nIf so, what is th=\r\ne meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his observation =\r\nonly a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can one observe a possi=\r\nbility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren=\r\n&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua contained in i=\r\nt merely a set of infinite possibilities?\n=A0\nSome great rishis can see not=\r\n just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the same time, i.e=\r\n. they can see various possibilities based on various possible actions. How=\r\never, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one possibility.\n=\r\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBottomline: At the =\r\nlevel at which we exist, there is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Wi=\r\nthin the limits imposed by the reactions given by nature to your own previo=\r\nus actions, you do have a scope for engaging in different actions at this t=\r\nime. Depending on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly di=\r\nfferent. Some actions can even make the future significantly different. A r=\r\nishi may be able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possibi=\r\nlities for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most pos=\r\nsibilities upto 20 moves from now). An advanced=A0yogi may be able to see a=\r\n few possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a=\r\n few moves or guessing a future position).=A0But the supreme cosmic being k=\r\nnows the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist within Him.\n=A0\nH=\r\nowever, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame=\r\n of your consciousness! ) some of those possibilities. One may know all the=\r\n possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come t=\r\no fruition, but it is your actions=A0that actually make some of those possi=\r\nbilities a reality.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast=\r\n. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \nFrom: rajarshi nandy \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n=\r\nSent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste Narasimhaji\n=A0\nNo doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for al=\r\nl of us, however, I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up=\r\n in my mind. One of the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n=A0\nIf events =\r\nhave already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they h=\r\nappen in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug? =\r\nLike a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in reality does not exist!\n=A0\nI a=\r\nm not questioning that what you wrote in the mail about events having alrea=\r\ndy happened, because same has been said by other great spiritual people in =\r\nthe world. \n=A0\nBut my question is because I cannot reconcile this with a f=\r\nreewill.

He di=\r\nd not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he sa=\r\nw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he s=\r\naw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty roa=\r\nd. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n\n* * *\n\nThis boy is usua=\r\nlly playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, =\r\nI saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the epis=\r\node mentioned in the above mail.\n\nI asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;i=\r\nt is not that the future that is to come has not already happened. It has a=\r\nlready happened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. Y=\r\nou know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not t=\r\no know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n\nHe said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say =\r\nwhat I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or arti=\r\nculate. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sw=\r\neet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But=\r\n he could not express himself.\n\nI helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that futu=\r\nre has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people lat=\r\ner? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a =\r\nstudio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the s=\r\ncreen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying som=\r\nething like that?&quot;\n\nHe exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If so=\r\nmething is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But=\r\n somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has already=\r\n happened.&quot;\n\nThough he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along=\r\n these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over t=\r\nhe fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given h=\r\nis age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed lik=\r\ne an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he =\r\nwas trying to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusi=\r\nons about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n\nTime seems linear at the level of regular=\r\n consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of t=\r\nime becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established in n=\r\non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n\n* * *\n\nThe same boy once performed a ve=\r\nry short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beeja=\r\nakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I fel=\r\nt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energ=\r\ny I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blis=\r\nsful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done her=\r\ne. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciou=\r\nsnss.\n\nI had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that.=\r\n Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to m=\r\ny guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I=\r\n had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famo=\r\nus temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was=\r\n sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt =\r\nwas the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that i=\r\nntense shakti.\n\nInterestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes=\r\n, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is =\r\nthe bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, =\r\nbut it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n\n* * *\n\nThis boy performed a reall=\r\ny simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it s=\r\neemed like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. Th=\r\ne bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.\n\nRituals =\r\nhelp purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of=\r\n it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until on=\r\ne breaks through.\n\nKeep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do =\r\npay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The o=\r\nnly worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your=\r\n ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external=\r\n things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealos=\r\ny etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I=\r\n&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n\n* * *\n\nOvercomin=\r\ng ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easie=\r\nr. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, s=\r\npouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a te=\r\nmporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you ca=\r\nn, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant t=\r\nakes very good care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all=\r\n those things as his or her belongings.\n\nRealize that thinking of things as=\r\n &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves =\r\none&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing i=\r\ns taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant =\r\nwill accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This e=\r\nnables one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about w=\r\nhat one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n\nDeveloping the a=\r\nttitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wa=\r\nde the ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n\nBest=\r\n regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam=\r\n\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http=\r\n://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      See the Web&#39;s breaking stories, ch=\r\nosen by people like you.

Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you and others,=\r\n this possibility, that possibility&nbsp;and yet another possibility - all =\r\nare accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Now, let us come lower and into the field of duality. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The field of duality consist=\r\ns of infinite divisions of space, time and space-time continua.

However, field of duality also contain=\r\ns planes of consciousness where different senses of time and different spac=\r\ne-time continua (that may intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who ex=\r\nperiences such a space-time continuum in such a plane of consciousness&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;EM&gt;may &lt;/EM&gt;experience a point of time that maps to a future time in a re=\r\ngular space-time continuum being experienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute=\r\n in one space-time continuum may be 1 year in another space-time continuum.=\r\n Time is not as straight-forward an entity as one may think. Basically, the=\r\n field of duality contains infinite space-time continua and what one experi=\r\nences depends on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s &lt;EM&gt;self-awareness &lt;=\r\n/EM&gt;(Kundalini) is in.

He did not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described =\r\nwhat he saw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the =\r\nforms he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a=\r\n dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was =\r\nwith him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou=\r\n a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I asked what =\r\nhe was thinking. He\n said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has n=\r\not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen=\r\n later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was ge=\r\ntting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not kno=\r\nwn to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that =\r\nhe is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. Howeve=\r\nr, he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I =\r\nhelped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at some le=\r\nvel, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie =\r\nmay have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have alrea=\r\ndy seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happe=\r\nning in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He excla=\r\nimed,\n &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen =\r\nin future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able to se=\r\ne it before future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though h=\r\ne did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I =\r\ntold him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and=\r\n he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to=\r\n think and understand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him th=\r\nat he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think h=\r\now it was possible and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in h=\r\nis own way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness.=\r\n However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes cha=\r\nnged. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman =\r\nor Brahman or Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same boy once performed a very\n=\r\n short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaak=\r\nshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt =\r\na very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy =\r\nI feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissf=\r\nul and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here.=\r\n I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousn=\r\nss.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before t=\r\nhat. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next =\r\nto my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was wh=\r\nen I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a =\r\nfamous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which=\r\n was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I f=\r\nelt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I\n feel t=\r\nhat intense shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Interestingly, after we finished meditation and =\r\nopened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so fa=\r\nr, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how =\r\nto say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thi=\r\ns boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what I gi=\r\nve in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerful en=\r\nergy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most imp=\r\nortant thing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritu=\r\nal better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one =\r\nhas to keep doing it until one breaks through.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keep performing your =\r\nchosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you =\r\nengage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual prog=\r\nress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego\n becomes smaller, y=\r\nou can resist attraction to external things better and you can resist inter=\r\nnal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma be=\r\ntter. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root caus=\r\ne of all problems.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is =\r\nrelatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is a=\r\nround you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your ow=\r\nn body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of=\r\n these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining=\r\n the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his =\r\nmaster&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as his or her=\r\n belongings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necess=\r\nary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes th=\r\ne best care of things entrusted to one. When a\n thing is taken away, a serv=\r\nant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is =\r\nmaster&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the=\r\n best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not pos=\r\nsess or what is out of one&#39;s control.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Developing the attitude of a s=\r\nervant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean o=\r\nf worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer=\r\n.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrol=\r\noger.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologe=\r\nr.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro=\r\n. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJaga=\r\nn nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- - &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUO=\r\nTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--3--&gt;&lt;hr siz=\r\ne=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Looking for local information?
