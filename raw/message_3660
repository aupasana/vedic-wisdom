However, you are free to address me as you feel like an=\r\nd I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just came across Vimal=\r\nananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeate=\r\nd) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies w=\r\nith it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the =\r\nstate is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extreme=\r\nly important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Important inform=\r\nation about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was =\r\na big time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he=\r\n didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical b=\r\nody. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat=\r\n. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) th=\r\nat it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. F=\r\nurther, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very fr=\r\nequently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he d=\r\noes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the=\r\n questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these ar=\r\ne thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). W=\r\nhen we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba o=\r\nr any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they=\r\n are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realizati=\r\non. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their ind=\r\nividual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short th=\r\ney *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our=\r\n topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or c=\r\nhew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. Ther=\r\ne would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs=\r\n because as I said, they know complete background behind their each action =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moreover their self identification is missing from the action and=\r\n hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purp=\r\nose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna used =\r\nto frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from ot=\r\nhers. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume =\r\nanything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat a=\r\nnything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food=\r\n intake is extremely important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his st=\r\nay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for=\r\n majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. H=\r\ne might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so =\r\nthat he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradi=\r\ncate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is a=\r\nlso possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanuban=\r\ndha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would =\r\nhave showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its me=\r\nat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a n=\r\natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and =\r\nMother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a l=\r\nake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to US=\r\nA. When the boy, after\n some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years actually met Swami in USA for the =\r\nfirst time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water and when he =\r\nrequested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thoug=\r\nht told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will g=\r\nive him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa =\r\nYogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by=\r\n Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 4=\r\n0 years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are =\r\nNOT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well=\r\n as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Viv=\r\nekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Tr=\r\nailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self identified an=\r\nd utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kan=\r\nth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Ve=\r\ng eating.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage mea=\r\nt eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nwas=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athm=\r\na Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just e=\r\nating meat when he was living in USA also relished it.

He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Ka=\r\nrma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, th=\r\ne state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extre=\r\nmely important statement to answer our queries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Important information about Vimalananda which I\n came to know onl=\r\ny yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day=\r\n passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of hi=\r\ns departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequentl=\r\ny and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointe=\r\nd out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact tho=\r\nughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The=\r\n Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says =\r\nand not try to do what he does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Now wh=\r\natever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Le=\r\nt me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unreali=\r\nzed person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example case=\r\ns of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowl=\r\nedged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they\n are all realized souls=\r\n who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of =\r\neverything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectl=\r\ny and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are=\r\n doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I=\r\n would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed a=\r\nnimals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a spe=\r\ncific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, the=\r\ny know complete background behind their each action and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\noreover their self identification is missing from the action and hence it i=\r\ns like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without=\r\n binding them in any cause-effect chain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna used=\r\n to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from o=\r\nthers. He has a blazing spiritual fire\n burning within him which can consum=\r\ne anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat=\r\n anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of fo=\r\nod intake is extremely important.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If Vivekananda ate meat=\r\n during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is no=\r\nt possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of=\r\n that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst =\r\nwesterners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowl=\r\ny try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable h=\r\nabits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some bala=\r\nnced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible =\r\nthat he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by co=\r\nnsuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for tha=\r\nt but just a natural\n inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda=\r\n, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from =\r\ndrowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even plan=\r\nned to go to USA. When the boy, after some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; years actually=\r\n met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay aw=\r\nay from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, sw=\r\nami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru =\r\nwill come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later beca=\r\nme disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually giv=\r\nen a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami V=\r\nivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Swa=\r\nmi Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well =\r\nas self\n deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Viv=\r\nekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Tr=\r\nailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self identified an=\r\nd utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth =\r\n&lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal J=\r\ni,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;I was about to =\r\nask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; It is=\r\n clear from the below passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu),\n he=\r\n clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat when he was l=\r\niving in USA also relished it.
