But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.\n\n* * *\n\nYou a=\r\nre what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormones in it are form=\r\ned based on what we eat.\n\nMeat is highly taamasik. Eating meat increases ta=\r\nmas in one. It increases ego and identification with body and makes spiritu=\r\nal progress more difficult. After all, if one is eating flesh of an animal =\r\nthat was highly attached to its body, the quality of body attachment will b=\r\necome denser in one. This is not conducive to spiritual progress.\n\n* * *\n\nI=\r\nt is possible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remained fu=\r\nlly saattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a person. One wanting=\r\n to overcome identification with the body and make spiritual progress, is b=\r\netter off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains e=\r\ntc with mild spices).\n\nIf a meat-eating person stops eating meat and eats c=\r\nooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for protein) for several months,=\r\n while trying to read spiritual literature and trying to make spiritual pro=\r\ngress, one will see that it makes a big difference.\n\n* * *\n\nSomeone mention=\r\ned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters lik=\r\ne this, there is a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India.
