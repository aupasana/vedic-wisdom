A murti of any size (=\r\nidol) of the diety is preferred during\nthe\n&gt; &gt; homam but a picture will do =\r\nas well in case you don&#39;t have one. As\nfar\n&gt; &gt; as I know the shivalingam is=\r\n not required as part of the homam but\ndo\n&gt; &gt; worship it on a regular basis=\r\n now that you have it.\n\n&gt; How can I do this? I pray and meditate before it,=\r\n to be sure! (Or at\nleast\n&gt; I intend to, since this was just obtained this =\r\nday!) If I were to\noffer\n&gt; milk to Siva in the idol, I am not sure it would=\r\n not remain on the\nidol. Is\n&gt; it appropriate to clean the idol after abishe=\r\nkam (is that is the right\nword,\n&gt; if not please correct me)?\n\n\nYou can do a=\r\nbhishekham and shivaling puja before the homam but don&#39;t mix\nthem up in the=\r\n same ritual.  I am not an expert on shivalinga worship\nbut there are detai=\r\nled descriptions provided for in the Shiva Purana\nwith specific mantras for=\r\n worshiping the linga and what material to use\nfor abhishekham.  There are =\r\nsimple methods (just doint the panchakshari\nand offering liquids such as mi=\r\nlk, water, honey, ghee, sandle paste and\njuice) and detailed ones such as R=\r\nudraabhiskhekam and you can may your\nway up from the simple to the comple a=\r\ns you gain more knowledge and\nguidance.\n\n&gt; &gt; The size sold in stores can be=\r\n used as is but note that Camphor\n&gt; &gt; leaves no residue but does give out a=\r\n black carbon smoke so the\n&gt; &gt; amount that you want to use is a function of=\r\n the amount required to\n&gt; &gt; start the fire vs. any smoke restrictions in yo=\r\nur place.\n\n&gt; Smoke in my place would be a BAD thing. I have a &quot;studio&quot; apar=\r\ntment,\nwhich\n&gt; is basically one room with an attached kitchen and a separat=\r\ne bath and\n&gt; toilet area. I can and will open the door to try to alleviate =\r\nsmoke\n&gt; problems.\n\n\nYou will need to open the doors and have some cross ven=\r\ntilation as\notherwise regular homam will cause some soot deposit or blackne=\r\nss on the\nedges of the wall.  Since you live in Texas it should not be an i=\r\nssue to\nopen the doors and windows for most of the year.\n\n&gt; &gt; In my case, I=\r\n take 1/2 of the size commercially sold to start the\n&gt; &gt; Homam fire and you=\r\n may want to experiment a few times to right size\n&gt; &gt; it to your needs.\n\n&gt; =\r\nSo you mean 1/2 of a single &#39;tablet&#39; or 1/2 of the entire pack?\n\n\nIf you bu=\r\nrn 1/2 pack you will have to call the fire department !  I am\ntalking about=\r\n 1/2 of a single tablet.\n\n&gt; Yes, do it and see. I did remember to mention t=\r\nhat I was nervous about\n&gt; this, yes? I believe that I encountered &quot;raw&quot; Siv=\r\na many years ago. I\nwant\n&gt; to experience that again ... but I am frightened=\r\n, I admit it. Despite\nmy\n&gt; fears I am following the councils and teachings =\r\nof those who have come\n&gt; before me, often in spite of myself. My soul cries=\r\n out to Lord Siva,\n&quot;Thou\n&gt; art my God, how can I serve Thee?&quot; and He only a=\r\nnswers &quot;Tat tvam asi.&quot;\nAnd\n&gt; I weep for mankind.\n\n\nStart with Mahaganapati =\r\nHomam and do it for a few months and you will\nknow when you are ready to mo=\r\nve on to other Homams.  If you strongly\nidentify with Siva then the Siva Ho=\r\nmam and even Homam with Sri\nRudram/Chamakam (Rudra Homam) and rituals such =\r\nas Rudra Abhishekham\nwould suit you very well.  Once you perform Mahaganapa=\r\nti Homam for a few\nmonths you will gain confidence and protection before yo=\r\nu move on to\nShiva Homams.  Mahaganapati is a gentle diety and so you shoul=\r\nd not have\nany &quot;raw experiences&quot; or have very little thereof.\n\n&gt; &gt; I cannot=\r\n say much on this except that the left side of your body is\n&gt; &gt; the Moon ch=\r\nannel which is cool and both copper and Shiva are\n&gt; &gt; associated with the S=\r\nun channel. If you are wearing it on the\n&gt; &gt; left side and it feels good th=\r\nen perhaps you needed to fire up\n&gt; &gt; your left hand side. Try to flip the w=\r\nrist and see how you feel.\n\n&gt; Sensible. I will try that.\n&gt;\nJust from your e=\r\nmail I can sense a very strong emotional side to you so\nyou seem to have a =\r\nstrong Moon Channel which is great for Bhakti so\nwearing the copper Shiva b=\r\nracelet on the left side may be giving you\nsome required balance.  Once you=\r\n start doing Homa your right side will\nget more active also since you are d=\r\nealing with agni and this will\nfurther balance the strong emotional left ch=\r\nannel in your body.\n\n&gt; &gt; Based on my limited understanding, the Homam ash i=\r\ns energized with\n&gt; &gt; the mantras and the presence of the diety whom you inv=\r\noked into the\n&gt; &gt; fire and taking a portion of that offering and putting in=\r\n on your\n&gt; &gt; forehead is to gain both protection (tilaka) as well as to ask=\r\n for\n&gt; &gt; blessings to open the third eye of wisdom.\n&gt;\n&gt; Understood. I was w=\r\nondering about the Saivite history (or so I have\nbeen\n&gt; led to believe) of =\r\nthree horizontal lines on the foreheard and the\npossible\n&gt; symbolism of tha=\r\nt.\n\n\nUnderstand the differences between the horizontal lines, the dot, the\n=\r\nlines used by the vaishnavites (u shaped), and other forms of tilaka. \nIf y=\r\nou feel comfortable with the horizontal lines then do that.\n\n\n\n\r\n--5-8474459746-6369400941=:6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you ever so much for your insights.
