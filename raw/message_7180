I will share some \nthough=\r\nts.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen one is thirsty, one can drink water (H2O) to=\r\n get some energy. From \nthe same water, we can also make different mineral =\r\nwaters, vitamin \nwaters, flavored waters, soft drinks of various kinds etc =\r\nand drink them \ninstead of water.\n\nHindu scriptures say that there is only =\r\ngod (Brahman or Aatman or Self), \nbut that god manifests as different devat=\r\nas (deities) with various \nnatures, qualities and energies.\n\nThe one god - =\r\nBrahman or Allah or Holy Spirit - has no qualities (like \nform, color, shap=\r\ne, nature etc) and is beyond description and the source \nof all deities. Si=\r\nmilarly, plain water - which is the source of all \nother drinks - has no ta=\r\nste or smell or flavor. Deities arising from \nthat one god have various qua=\r\nlities (gentle, fierce etc). Similarly, \nmany kinds of flavored water and s=\r\noft drinks have different taste, smell \nand flavor. Just as one can drink w=\r\nhatever drink one likes, based on \none&#39;s taste, to quench thirst, similarly=\r\n one can worship whatever deity \none likes, based on one&#39;s taste, to quench=\r\n the inner thirst of one&#39;s \nsoul and give it energy to do its work.\n\n*     =\r\n   *        *\n\nJust as Abraham said no to the worship of idols and forms an=\r\nd installed \nthe notion of one god, one can ban flavored drinks and say tha=\r\nt only \nplain water can be drunk. That is not wrong, but most people find w=\r\nater \ntoo plain and prefer different drinks. Similarly, most people cannot =\r\n\nrelate to ONE formless (i.e. beyond forms) god and using specific forms \nb=\r\nased on one&#39;s mental state helps improve devotion.\n\n*        *        *\n\nJu=\r\nst as different people may call water with different names (water, \npaani, =\r\njalam, tanni, neellu, acqua, wasser etc), similarly different \npeople may c=\r\nall the one god as Brahman or Parabrahma or Aatman or Buddha \nor Self or Al=\r\nlah or Ahora Mazda or Holy Spirit or whatever. There&#39;s \nnothing in a name. =\r\nFighting that Allah is superior or Brahman, is akin \nto fighting that paani=\r\n is superior to jalam!\n\nWhen you have water or a drink, the key is to drink=\r\n it and get energy. \nIf one stores it, flaunts it and looks at now and then=\r\n, it won&#39;t quench \nthirst. Similarly, keeping a god&#39;s idol or picture or a =\r\nscripture or \nreading it now, it won&#39;t quench the inner thirst. One needs t=\r\no think of \ngod in mind, contemplate on the nature of god and get some of t=\r\nhat \nnature within oneself through resonance. That gives energy and \ntransf=\r\norms one.\n\n*        *        *\n\n From the &quot;Fire Yoga&quot; guide (http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/fire):\n\nPeople have the notion that there are different go=\r\nds who created \ndifferent people. But the fact is that one god created this=\r\n whole \nuniverse and god is beyond forms, beyond knowing, beyond understand=\r\ning \nand beyond describing. People who have experienced different aspects o=\r\nf \nthis one god have given different names and descriptions and different \n=\r\npaths to reach god.\n\nDespite the existence of many religions and many notio=\r\nns of god today, \none thing we can declare confidently is that god is one a=\r\nnd all \nreligions are different attempts to reach that one god or cosmic \nc=\r\nonsciousness. Infinite god cannot be captured completely by anything \nfinit=\r\ne, including religion. God can be realized only though internal \nexperience=\r\n and not through reading books or intellectual discussions or \nhearing abou=\r\nt someone else=E2=80=99s description of god.\n\n*        *        *\n\nHappy Ga=\r\nnesha Chaturthi to all of you!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, =\r\nFree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for=\r\n short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writing=\r\ns: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twit=\r\nter ID: @homam108\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n\n\n"}}
