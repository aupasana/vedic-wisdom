That is why.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; My t=\r\nwo cents :\n&gt; \n&gt; To make dry coconut you need heat more than the sunlight. Y=\r\nes the coconut will rot if you keep it outside in the sun for so long. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I long back saw in Food TV in US.....he kept the whole coconut in conv=\r\nentional oven for one hour. Then he broke the shell with a hammer. The shel=\r\nl came out easily and the whole coconut stayed intact. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think onc=\r\ne the shell comes out put the whole coconut in oven again, that way the wat=\r\ner will dry out and you will get a dry coconut.=C2=A0 You can shake the coc=\r\nonut to see if there is water inside or not and accordingly experiment. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this works...good luck with your homams.

I thank you for guiding me so detailed... =\r\nwithout your manual it would never be possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting point to n=\r\note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family f=\r\nor about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam!=\r\n However I was disappoint because their procedure was so big that it would =\r\ntake about 3 hours for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, =\r\nthey learnt it from &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it was their own tradition. They are n=\r\not a modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many tradi=\r\ntions, research on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had =\r\nno idea that a shorter version is possible, or something can be left out. A=\r\ns an example, they suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an =\r\n&#39;x&#39; times offering in homam, and many more formalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I knew in =\r\nBangladesh I would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be =\r\nable to perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. \n&gt; \n&gt; Much l=\r\nater when I was reading your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc=\r\n. from their teaching :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway Ji...\n&gt; \n&gt; Everything was almost as p=\r\ner recommendation, except I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I =\r\ncouldn&#39;t manage a wooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I have to=\r\n order it... but I will have to work much hard to find a craft-man who can =\r\nmake a spoon with wood.\n&gt; \n&gt; I burnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-stic=\r\nks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Purnahuti with ghee only.\n&gt; \n&gt; That WAS the problem. Soon after st=\r\narting the fire, I had an idea how fast the woods were burning. So while I =\r\nwas moving with the homam, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as a purna=\r\nhuti, the fire will not survive long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Beca=\r\nuse the woods were burning out fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I could not meditate.\n&gt; \n&gt; My =\r\nfirst Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the fire last lo=\r\nng so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing me mediate? I noted even =\r\nif I had put much wood, they would still burn out fast...\n&gt; \n&gt; Offering ful=\r\nl / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would keep the fire alive =\r\nfor 10-15 mins and let me meditate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another Q. - 2) I have sliced coco=\r\nnut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how =\r\nlong it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, =\r\nmy question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much that it becomes BURN=\r\nABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a =\r\nfull coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotten or something? =\r\nAny procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any idea about that=\r\n, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnable&quot; full coconuts. That is wh=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantras work very strong for me. But I feel not strong enough for b=\r\nig spiritual or material effects. I have had very strong experiences with h=\r\nomam before while performing with others. Even a few times I *arranged* hom=\r\nams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect working on me als=\r\no.\n&gt; \n&gt; Today with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I know why, b=\r\necause it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I should h=\r\nonestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva in the =\r\nfire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried and nervo=\r\nus about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presence. Which=\r\n I should. I guess it will improve with time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am going to add mantra=\r\ns from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homams l=\r\nike Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-rela=\r\nted Sanskrit mantras are very important.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way I did 108 offering=\r\ns with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shan=\r\ni mantra again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at least I=\r\n didn&#39;t have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous =\r\nabout the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantra=\r\ns, almost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection of pronun=\r\nciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn&#39;=\r\nt give up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I saw the =\r\npower in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way to get the pure blessings, =\r\navoiding mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to sta=\r\ny in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mant=\r\nra japam experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me to st=\r\nay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with emp=\r\nty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam aft=\r\ner my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a lot o=\r\nf troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat any=\r\nthing after my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it be=\r\ncomes very difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with frie=\r\nnds etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is =\r\nthe thing I appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very=\r\n important] things always mentioned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same thing about your instruction=\r\n of minimum movement of the body, I find it very correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway Ji I =\r\nguess I am stretching my mail very long...\n&gt; \n&gt; my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your =\r\nmanual if I take Shani as an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or div=\r\ninity, I can offer other Gods&#39; mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha ho=\r\nmam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) If yes, should I =\r\nmaintain the graha order such as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Is=\r\n there any exceptional instruction while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc.,=\r\n or just like Shani?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wanted to mention that I am also planning to do h=\r\nomam of Maha Lakshmi and other deities but manuals for those deities are al=\r\nready there, hence these additional questions about graha-homams.\n&gt; \n&gt; Appr=\r\neciate your time to answer me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanking you again,\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
