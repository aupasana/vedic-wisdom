But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in one way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no &quot;experience&quot;. He was in sahaja samadhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touch or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is why he could do all that!!!).\n   \n  Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on their sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms and totally different paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With your attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in a good stead and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who needed to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people and came away silently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you.\n Shastras say that you should kill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong behavior? You should give them a piece of your mind.&quot;\n   \n  Spiritual sadhana does not mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a certain period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one transforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every action and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for introspection and transformation of internal attitude.\n   \n  Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of sishyas.\n   \n  Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobody and would be lower than dirt. I would not be able to say anything intelligent or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspired by something I write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and to Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace using me as an instrument and not to me.\n   \n  BTW, you are all free to forward my posts that you like to people who may be interested in spiritual discussions.

Krishna clearly says in \nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone \nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right \naction/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time \nand from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, \nwhich in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you \ndid in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the \npast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you \ncreated in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until \nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \nto kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \ntendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \nuniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \nritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \nmoney and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \nelders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight \non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \ndestruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, \nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \nrespected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \nothers. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n\n* * *\n\nThe tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\nSome people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \nof caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \ncaste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \nkilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \nkshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \nlater. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \nof father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one \ndevelops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\nThus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \ndharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \nthe world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \nmind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \nnoise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \nconfused.\n\nWe should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \ndecide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \nthe best we can is all that we can do!\n\nMore than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \nactions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \npossible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \nsituation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the \naction as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result \nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \nuntached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \nAs we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \nThere is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \ndharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \nbut not as difficult as people think.\n\nThe bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with \nlittle attachment.\n\n* * *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \nAnother external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \ndebts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \none&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \none&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \ndeclare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \ntime to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \nout what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \ndharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \nsadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \nattachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \none&#39;s individual dharma.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;\n&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n                           \n\r\n--0-1112345975-1222646374=:71398\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Hare Rama Krishna&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Ive read several apparently derogatory things about Paramahamsa Yogananda- that he ate meat, drank and had women at different times.

Krishna clearly says in &lt;BR&gt;Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone &lt;BR&gt;else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time &lt;BR&gt;and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you &lt;BR&gt;did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the &lt;BR&gt;past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you &lt;BR&gt;created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until &lt;BR&gt;now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person &lt;BR&gt;to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n mental &lt;BR&gt;tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of &lt;BR&gt;uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the &lt;BR&gt;ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;BR&gt;money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, &lt;BR&gt;elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, &lt;BR&gt;to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some\n people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this &lt;BR&gt;new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his &lt;BR&gt;aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to &lt;BR&gt;others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;of caste (varna) has been\n there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by &lt;BR&gt;killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;the world. Each person has individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our &lt;BR&gt;mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;noise from other parts of our\n minds which tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;confused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;the best we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not &lt;BR&gt;accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build &lt;BR&gt;too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best &lt;BR&gt;possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the &lt;BR&gt;action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;untached action) will\n simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;but not as difficult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with &lt;BR&gt;little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR&gt;Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can &lt;BR&gt;derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of &lt;BR&gt;the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought\n killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his &lt;BR&gt;dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR&gt;and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material &lt;BR&gt;world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from &lt;BR&gt;time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find &lt;BR&gt;out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s\n understanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free\n Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=&quot;mailto:dahiyajiten%40yahoo.co.in&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it has to do\n something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; jitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\r\n--0-1112345975-1222646374=:71398--\r\n\n"}}
