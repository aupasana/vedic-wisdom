I know \nsome things because I heard from a person or read in a book and hence I can \nidentify the external source of that knowledge. But some knowledge just \ncomes from inside and I am not really sure of the source. This one is like \nthat.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees that what I know, from outside or from \nwithin, is correct. So please take what I write with a pinch of salt.\n\nI always remind people that I am not much of a scholar and merely a dumb \nservant of my guru and Mother. What *they* give me, from outside or from \nwithin, I merely share with others.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, February 15, 2009 12:38 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Agni\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha\n&gt; Good Post, Thanks for the definitions\n&gt; What is the source of the definition of fire, is it agni puran?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You ask a very good question.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Agni is the element of transformation. It symbolizes absorbing and\n&gt; digesting experiences. As you make offerings in fire and they burn in\n&gt; fire, various spiritual experiences are processed and digested by\n&gt; your internal fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tongue is that which allows one to taste things that one is going\n&gt; to accept inside and digest. Each tongue of fire stands for a spirit\n&gt; that controls how you absorb spiritual experiences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The seven tongues of Agni are: Kaali, Karaali, Manojava, Sulohita,\n&gt; Sudhoomra-Varna, Sphulingini, and Vishwaruchi.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kaali is the dark and black/blue fire. It symbolizes the spirit of\n&gt; detachment. Spirit of detachment controls how you absorb your\n&gt; experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Karaali is the monstrous, dreadful fire that looks like a wide open\n&gt; mouth. Spirit of attachment and desire controls how you absorb your\n&gt; experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Manojava is the swiftly moving, flickering and unstable flame.\n&gt; Spirit of wavering (could also be flexibility) controls how you\n&gt; absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sulohita is the (copper like) dark red color flame. Spirit of\n&gt; determination and strength controls how you absorb your experiences,\n&gt; when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sudhoomra-Varna is the greyish/purple/smoke-colored fire. Spirit of\n&gt; confusion (could also be resolution of confusion) controls how you\n&gt; absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sphulingini is the fire with sparks. Spirit of aggression and haste\n&gt; (could also be a great intuition/insight) controls how you absorb\n&gt; your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Vishwaruchi is the bright fire. Spirit of focus, knowing, being and\n&gt; bliss controls how you absorb your experiences, when you are offering\n&gt; in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As you keep performing homam and a relationship is formed between\n&gt; you and fire, the external fire in the homa kundam will reflect your\n&gt; internal fire. When your mind is well-focused and blissful, the fire\n&gt; will automatically burn bright.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The state of your mind will decide how you will taste the spiritual\n&gt; experiences you are going to absorb from around you. That in turn\n&gt; decides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal fire are\n&gt; receiving food right now. That in turn decides which tongues of the\n&gt; external fire are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The external fire is a mirror to your internal state. An adept may\n&gt; be able to detect, looking at the fire, which tongues of fire are\n&gt; active right now and hence guess the state your mind is in.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, trying to pay too much attention to this technicality\n&gt; and becoming over-conscious of the nature of fire is unneeded. Though\n&gt; external can be used to manipulate the internal (within some limits),\n&gt; it can become a distraction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Whether internal follows external or external follows internal a\n&gt; invalid question. The reality is that the two change together.\n&gt; Neither is the cause and neither is the effect. They just happen\n&gt; together.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fire with the\n&gt; *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happen\n&gt; automatically. It may take time, but it will happen by itself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What do the seven &quot;tongues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
