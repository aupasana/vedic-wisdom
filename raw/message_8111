I have a few more =\r\nthings to ask you.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Right after digbandhah, for some Gods like Hanum=\r\nana, Sani etc. there is a small &#39;dhyanam&#39; part. I was wondering whether I s=\r\nhould recite this loudly too, or just say this part inside my mind and medi=\r\ntate? (As it says &#39;Dhyanam&#39;) But there is no different instructions given. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry to ask so many questions but Dhyanam is not there in Maha =\r\nGanapati Prana Pratisthapana, so I could not check from the video whether i=\r\nt is to be loudly said, or just to meditate with it for a little while.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 2) I understand that when you&#39;re declaring the Rshi, you are indicating m=\r\niddle of the head. When chhandah, lips. When Devata, middle of the chest. A=\r\nnd for the beejam and (later) kilakam it&#39;s the same place you indicated... =\r\nbut is it navel (nabhi) you are indicating?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) While declaring the sha=\r\nktih, are you indicating spine-base (kundalini)?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am quite sure I per=\r\nhaps will not be having anymore questions about Prana Pratisthapana :-)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; By the way, please don&#39;t address me &#39;Ji&#39;. Kindly call me by my name. I am=\r\n much junior to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
