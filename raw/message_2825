[Book-learned Pandits like vultures.]\n\nBhagavan, laughing: Yes, but you are not like that.Mere book-learned Pandits\n(scholars) are hard-hearted. They do good neither to themselves nor to\nothers. They are like vultures who soar high in the sky, but always search\nafter carrion-pits. They may talk about Divine truths, but their minds are\nattached to woman and wealth.\n\nTheir attachment is to worldly things (Avidya). Compassion, Devotion\n(Bhakti), Dispassion (Vairagya)--these are the manifestations of Vidya.\n\nVidyasagar was listening to the words of wisdom with whole attention, while\nthe eyes of other gentlemen present were fixed upon the blissful face of\nRamakrishna radiant with Divine glory. [p. 104]\n\nThe Bhagavan continued: The Absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of Vidya\n(knowledge) as well as of Avidya (ignorance), which keeps one away from the\nrealization of the Absolute. The absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of\nMaya, while Maya is either Vidya or Avidya. Vidya-Maya and Avidya-Maya both\nexist in this world.\n\nAs there are knowledge (Jnana) and Devotion (Bhakti), so also there are lust\nand greed for wealth. Good and evil, virtue and vice, are to be found in\nthis world of relativity; but Brahman is unaffected by them. They exist in\nrelation to Jiva (individual ego), but cannot touch the Absolute Brahman.\n[p. 105]\n\nSource: THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--001485e8e5879a0a5e04757b65e5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\nBhagavan: Whatever work is done for the good of others is abso=\r\nlutely free from fault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;He who p=\r\nerforms good works through love, without seeking results, attains to God.&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;=A0But he who works for name, fame or any other selfish purpose remain=\r\ns bound.
