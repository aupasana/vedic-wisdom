Similarly, some\nof\n&gt; the names of a fierce &gt; deity may desc=\r\nribe a gentle form. Bottomline\nis\n&gt; that different deities &gt; describe diffe=\r\nrent energy forms and several\n&gt; other enegy forms can be &gt; *derived* from t=\r\nhat energy. Energy is\n&gt; convertible.&gt; &gt; For example, you can generate elect=\r\nric energy or\n&gt; magnetic energy or &gt; mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear=\r\n energy\nfrom\n&gt; a big nuclear fusion. &gt; If 1000 names of the nuclear fusion =\r\ndescribe\nit\n&gt; in one name as energy &gt; that lights up a house or a town, don=\r\n&#39;t think\nit\n&gt; is a gentle form. It &gt; can support that gentle aspect too, bu=\r\nt it is a\n&gt; very fierce form. If you &gt; really see that energy in its raw fo=\r\nrm, you\n&gt; will see that nuclear fusion &gt; is certainly not gentle.&gt; &gt; One wh=\r\no\n&gt; experienced the energy of a supposed fierce deity as being &gt; gentle or\n=\r\n&gt; vice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that deity in the complete form &gt; and\n&gt; exp=\r\nerienced only a small derived aspect of that deity.&gt; &gt; (4) Though I\n&gt; say t=\r\nhat the real form of deities is energy, the &gt; iconography IS very\n&gt; importa=\r\nnt and holds keys. However, some keys of some &gt; particularly\n&gt; powerful sid=\r\ndha mantras are intentionally misplaced by &gt; rishis.&gt; &gt;\nFor\n&gt; example, I kn=\r\now someone who was doing sadhana of a higher deity. He &gt;\n&gt; was imagining he=\r\nr in a form using a popular dhyana shloka. This\npopular\n&gt; &gt; dhyana shloka f=\r\nor that mantra - which is known to be a siddha mantra\n-\n&gt; &gt; matches the ima=\r\ngery created by some key words in the mantra.

After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him\na\n&gt; &gt; different dhyana=\r\n shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi\nof\n&gt; &gt; past, which is no=\r\nt typically used with that particular mantra,\nbecause\n&gt; &gt; some words in the=\r\n mantra suggest a different imagery. This sadhaka &gt;\n&gt; switched to it. He st=\r\narted visualizing the deity differently. Though &gt;\n&gt; this visualization was =\r\ncontrary to the words in the mantra, this &gt;\n&gt; actually worked. It made a bi=\r\ng difference. The person started to &gt;\n&gt; experience some things internally a=\r\nnd understood the essence of the &gt;\n&gt; mantra in a flash. Now, the true meani=\r\nng of the mantra became crystal\n&gt;\n&gt; clear through an internal experience.&gt; =\r\n&gt; The final understanding was\n&gt; internal, philosophical and based on subtle=\r\n &gt; play of different cosmic\n&gt; energies.

Though &gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; this visualization was contrary to the words in the mantra, this &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; actually worked. It made a big difference. The person started to &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; experience some things internally and understood the essence of t=\r\nhe &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; mantra in a flash. Now, the true meaning of the mantra beca=\r\nme crystal &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; clear through an internal experience.&gt; &gt; The =\r\nfinal understanding was&lt;br&gt;&gt; internal, philosophical and based on subtle=\r\n &gt; play of different cosmic&lt;br&gt;&gt; energies. But, that beautiful unders=\r\ntanding was &gt; triggered ONLY AFTER a&lt;br&gt;&gt; specific physical form was =\r\nimagined by the mind.&gt; &gt; Some powerful&lt;br&gt;&gt; mantras do have a spec=\r\nific physical form associated with &gt; them and you&lt;br&gt;&gt; will be kind o=\r\nf lost without knowing that form or &gt; corresponding&lt;br&gt;&gt; dhyana.&gt; =\r\n&gt; (5) BTW, having said the above, I need to make one important&lt;br&gt;&gt; p=\r\noint.&gt; &gt; It is foolish to go around asking people and gurus to give y=\r\nou&lt;br&gt;&gt; the right &gt; mantra or dhyana of this or that mantra. Until yo=\r\nu are pure&lt;br&gt;&gt; enough and &gt; prepared, no real yogi will ever give yo=\r\nu the keys to&lt;br&gt;&gt; anything really &gt; siddha, i.e. powerful and potent=\r\n enough to work&lt;br&gt;&gt; quickly. Instead take &gt; something standard like =\r\nChandipath or Vishnu&lt;br&gt;&gt; sahasranama stotram and &gt; keep chanting it =\r\nor doing homam with it. First&lt;br&gt;&gt; prepare yourself. When &gt; you are p=\r\nrepared, Nature will make arrangements&lt;br&gt;&gt; for whatever is required &gt=\r\n; for your dharma.&gt; &gt; Best regards,&gt; Narasimha&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; -------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&gt; &quot;Do It&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&gt;       Films that make a difference:=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;       Spirituality:&lt;br&gt;&gt; http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;    Jyotish writings:&lt;br&gt;&gt; http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;                      &lt;br&gt;&gt; Tw=\r\nitter ID: @homam108&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao pvr@ wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Based on my experience and understandin=\r\ng, I will share my 2 cents on&lt;br&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; topics that came up =\r\nrecently.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) The rahasyas of Chandipath describe=\r\ns the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Original Root of All) form of Mahal=\r\nakshmi and also the 3 derived forms&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi a=\r\nnd Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalakshmi forms&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; are different!). I=\r\nt does not specifically describe the form of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Chandi&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) The real form of deities is energy, that can manifest wit=\r\nhin one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; own consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) Lal=\r\nita is a gentle form as the name implies. However, some of her&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n names describe a fierce form. Similarly, some of the names of a fierce&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; deity may describe a gentle form. Bottomline is that different de=\r\nities&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; describe different energy forms and several other enegy =\r\nforms can be&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy is convertible=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; For example, you can generate electric energy o=\r\nr magnetic energy or&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear en=\r\nergy from a big nuclear&lt;br&gt;&gt; fusion.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If 1000 names of the n=\r\nuclear fusion describe it in one name as energy&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that lights up=\r\n a house or a town, don&#39;t think it is a gentle form. It&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; can su=\r\npport that gentle aspect too, but it is a very fierce form. If&lt;br&gt;&gt; you&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; really see that energy in its raw form, you will see that nucl=\r\near&lt;br&gt;&gt; fusion&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; is certainly not gentle.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; One who experienced the energy of a supposed fierce deity as being&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; gentle or vice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that deity in the comp=\r\nlete&lt;br&gt;&gt; form&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and experienced only a small derived aspect =\r\nof that deity.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (4) Though I say that the real for=\r\nm of deities is energy, the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; iconography IS very important and =\r\nholds keys. However, some keys of&lt;br&gt;&gt; some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; particularly po=\r\nwerful siddha mantras are intentionally misplaced by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; rishis.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; For example, I know someone who was doing sadhana =\r\nof a higher deity.&lt;br&gt;&gt; He&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; was imagining her in a form usin=\r\ng a popular dhyana shloka. This&lt;br&gt;&gt; popular&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; dhyana shloka =\r\nfor that mantra - which is known to be a siddha mantra -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; match=\r\nes the imagery created by some key words in the mantra. He was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n doing the sadhana sincerely, but never formed a connection to the&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nmantra&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; or experienced anything. After a few weeks, his guru/me=\r\nntor gave him a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; different dhyana shloka of the same deity comp=\r\nosed by a great yogi of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; past, which is not typically used with=\r\n that particular mantra, because&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; some words in the mantra sugg=\r\nest a different imagery. This sadhaka&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; switched to it. He start=\r\ned visualizing the deity differently. Though&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; this visualizatio=\r\nn was contrary to the words in the mantra, this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; actually worke=\r\nd. It made a big difference. The person started to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; experience =\r\nsome things internally and understood the essence of the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; mantr=\r\na in a flash. Now, the true meaning of the mantra became crystal&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; clear through an internal experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The fina=\r\nl understanding was internal, philosophical and based on&lt;br&gt;&gt; subtle&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; play of different cosmic energies. But, that beautiful understand=\r\ning&lt;br&gt;&gt; was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; triggered ONLY AFTER a specific physical form =\r\nwas imagined by the&lt;br&gt;&gt; mind.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Some powerful m=\r\nantras do have a specific physical form associated with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; them a=\r\nnd you will be kind of lost without knowing that form or&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; corre=\r\nsponding dhyana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (5) BTW, having said the above, =\r\nI need to make one important point.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is foolish=\r\n to go around asking people and gurus to give you the&lt;br&gt;&gt; right&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; mantra or dhyana of this or that mantra.
