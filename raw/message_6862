I=\r\n used to do homam quite regularly as in my earlier apartment i could safely=\r\n take out batteries of fire alarm. \n\n2. Smoke is very minimal to almost zer=\r\no. the right amount of ghee keep it to zero. at the end when fire dies out =\r\nit does produce smoke. i used to keep the kund outside in the garden. you c=\r\nan certainly keep it near window when done.\n\n3. Right now i am in new apart=\r\n and here if i take batteries out then the doorman comes straightaway so i =\r\ncant do homam in new apartment. So instead of that i chant the strotras for=\r\n 1hr in morning and a mantra for 30min in night. Keep your sadhana regular.=\r\n \n\n4. You can buy kund on Indousplaza.com there are 3 sizes order the middl=\r\ne one. They have all the stuff.\n\n5. Start with ganapati homam only for firs=\r\nt 2-3 months.\n\nregard\npriyank\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ramn=\r\nath&quot; &lt;Ramnut@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am graduate student, studying =\r\nin US. It has been a long standing wish of mine to do homam regularly. Howe=\r\nver there are some practical problems. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1 Can I do a homam inside the =\r\nhouse? I am wondering if the smoke would raise the fire alarm etc. In summe=\r\nr, though it is terribly hot here, I can still afford to open the windows. =\r\nIn winter this is next to impossible. I am not worried abt my home catching=\r\n fire, but I am worried abt the fire safety alarm. The leasing office levie=\r\ns hefty fines for violating fire safety rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2 Do you know any place=\r\n in US where I can find a small homa kunda and other necessary items? \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n shubham bhavatu\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramnath\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
