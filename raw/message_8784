It can satiate your hunger, but you\nalways know, that something was missi=\r\nng. A sookha fulka is a little less\njoyous to eat than one with ghee. Don&#39;t=\r\n use the word &#39;dosha&#39; it will\ndrive people away. It is not a dosha. Mr Agni=\r\n likes the offering with\nghee, he prefers it that way, but accepts it other=\r\nwise too. Not offering\nwith ghee does not result in a &#39;dosha&#39; in the tradit=\r\nional sense of the\nword. See, the person who said that it results in &#39;dosha=\r\n&#39; might have a\nvery different definition of this word, to the one that many=\r\n will\ncomprehend. For him/her, it might be regular usage for a simple &#39;faul=\r\nt&#39;,\nfor somebody reading it might be &quot; OMFG, What the hell have I done? I\nd=\r\nid a Dosha for so long!!&quot; Oh well, calm down. Even if you committed a\ndosha=\r\n, what the hell have you been doing when you are reading that\n&quot;anagyatam, y=\r\nadagyatam, yagasya kriyte mithu....&quot; section. You are\napologizing specifica=\r\nlly to Mr Agni, aren&#39;t you? Thus you have already\nsaid sorry for this, so n=\r\next time onwards, just put a little ghee to\nwhatever you offer. it helps Mr=\r\n Agni, to carry it forward or to accept\nit depending on the situation, and =\r\nas you are hosting him it is your\nparamount duty to take care of him when h=\r\ne comes. He comes and actually\ndoes a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerate=\r\ns our foolishness and\nignorance and does not burn our house/us down in ange=\r\nr  ( very capable\nof doing so ), thus help him out and treat him with honor=\r\n. He is a\nliving being. being hot is his nature, I am not talking about Par=\r\nis\nhilton waala &quot;hot&quot; here. An offering with ghee, helps him out when\ncompa=\r\nred to a dry one, but he still accepts the latter, but prefers the\nformer.\n=\r\n\n    * Regarding the ratios and everything else ----\nA purusha-acharana is =\r\ntoo complex and requires an extreme amount of\ndiscipline to complete. Conce=\r\npts detailing to mantra siddhi and all\nthat, but walk on to these paths whe=\r\nn the basics are there. The best\npart is , when the basics are complete, go=\r\nd will automatically graduate\nyou tot his level, it might take 10 days, or =\r\n10 years, or 10 months, who\nthe hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form=\r\n of your god you are\nworshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are=\r\n, need not worry\nabout the ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that y=\r\nou become\n&quot;big&quot; enough to apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you ar=\r\ne\nheaded down some specific route, and you need to do it as per\ninstruction=\r\ns from your teacher( god )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If\nyou are gettin=\r\ng confused with 10 times then one, or 100 times then one\nor what om and wha=\r\nt tarpyami or what swaha..... chuck it. Just offer the\nmantra in the fire, =\r\nwith utter sincerity and forget that you ever\noffered too. If you are to be=\r\n taken on a path that requires the ratios,\nyou will be taken, no issues. Ti=\r\nll then, keep offering the single\nrepetition just like, you are now. Unless=\r\n and until, significant penance\nis done, theory about ratios and how it all=\r\n works, will go over our\nheads, and confuse even further. It is useless to =\r\ndiscuss it, will only\ngive rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend=\r\n time chanting\ninstead.\n\n    * One more pointer, since I think I read somew=\r\nhere as to how we can\nimprove our homams. Offer any thing to the fire with =\r\nlove, I sometimes\nnotice, people throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the fea=\r\nr of getting\nburnt, pulling the hand away extremely quickly. Remember you a=\r\nre feeding\nsomeone, and that someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the one w=\r\nho sits\nin front of you and makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mother f=\r\needs\nher child bites of food, even though the fingers are always at risk of=\r\n\ngetting bitten and coming back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se\npyaar=\r\n se, feed Mr Agni, he will appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you\ncan mod=\r\nify your hand movement and integrate some grace in the way an\noffering is m=\r\nade, doesn&#39;t matter even if it is made from a distance. It\ncan take some ti=\r\nme getting used to, practice makes perfect!\n    * A sub pointer in improvin=\r\ng your homam is the appreciation of the\nfact of the suffering of the offeri=\r\nng! Bow down to your golas , the tils\n, the mithai,  the ghee, &quot;spiritual p=\r\nrogress tumhaari, jalegi humari&quot;\nseems to be the chant from whatever you ar=\r\ne offering!! LOL . Mind you,\nsomebody is jumping straight in to Mr agni&#39;s m=\r\nouth on your behest, the\ngola nariyaal you so gladly cut inside out, ouch t=\r\nhe pain!! Because\nthose too are manifestations of the same divine and their=\r\n sacrifice is\nsupreme, thus bow down and sincerely thank god for manifestin=\r\ng and\nproviding you the material to do this wonderful ritual.\n\nRam Ram\n\n-- =\r\nBaccha Singh\n\nNow watch this and laugh your ass off.\nhttp://www.youtube.com=\r\n/watch?v=3DntQkgeko_i8\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot;=\r\n &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Jay bhai,\n&gt;\n&gt; Aaapne chopdi na thoth=\r\na bahu vaanchya ane bahu dahi dahi vato kari ne\npravachan aapya.

Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha.\n=\r\n(that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one\nbecomes q=\r\nualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha (\ni.e. for every=\r\n 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified\nto give 1 ahuti)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I rea=\r\nd\nin Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with\nthat=\r\n book series)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything.

Concepts detailin=\r\ng to mantra siddhi and all that, but walk on to these paths when the basics=\r\n are there. The best part is , when the basics are complete, god will autom=\r\natically graduate you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or 10 years, or=\r\n 10 months, who the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form of your god=\r\n you are worshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are, need not w=\r\norry about the ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that you become &quot;b=\r\nig&quot; enough to apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you are headed dow=\r\nn some specific route, and you need to do it as per instructions from your =\r\nteacher( god )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If you are getting confused w=\r\nith 10 times then one, or 100 times then one or what om and what tarpyami o=\r\nr what swaha..... chuck it. Just offer the mantra in the fire, with utter s=\r\nincerity and forget that you ever offered too. If you are to be taken on a =\r\npath that requires the ratios, you will be taken, no issues. Till then, kee=\r\np offering the single repetition just like, you are now. Unless and until, =\r\nsignificant penance is done, theory about ratios and how it all works, will=\r\n go over our heads, and confuse even further. It is useless to discuss it, =\r\nwill only give rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend time chanti=\r\nng instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One more pointer, since I think I read somewhere as=\r\n to how we can improve our homams. Offer any thing to the fire with love, I=\r\n sometimes notice, people throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the fear of ge=\r\ntting burnt, pulling the hand away extremely quickly. Remember you are feed=\r\ning someone, and that someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the one who sits=\r\n in front of you and makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mother feeds he=\r\nr child bites of food, even though the fingers are always at risk of gettin=\r\ng bitten and coming back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se pyaar se, fe=\r\ned Mr Agni, he will appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you can modify you=\r\nr hand movement and integrate some grace in the way an offering is made, do=\r\nesn&#39;t matter even if it is made from a distance. It can take some time gett=\r\ning used to, practice makes perfect!&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sub pointer in improvi=\r\nng your homam is the appreciation of the fact of the suffering of the offer=\r\ning! Bow down to your golas , the tils , the mithai,&nbsp; the ghee, &quot;spiri=\r\ntual progress tumhaari, jalegi humari&quot; seems to be the chant from whatever =\r\nyou are offering!! LOL . Mind you, somebody is jumping straight in to Mr ag=\r\nni&#39;s mouth on your behest, the gola nariyaal you so gladly cut inside out, =\r\nouch the pain!! Because those too are manifestations of the same divine and=\r\n their sacrifice is supreme, thus bow down and sincerely thank god for mani=\r\nfesting and providing you the material to do this wonderful ritual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/u=\r\nl&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram Ram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Baccha Singh&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Now watch this and laugh your ass=\r\n off.&lt;br&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DntQkgeko_i8&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste Jay bhai,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Aaapne chopdi na thotha bahu =\r\nvaanchya ane bahu dahi dahi vato kari ne pravachan aapya.

Hmm... let me see...=\r\n Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your hom=\r\ne regularly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very su=\r\nrprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the h=\r\navan I did at home)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are=\r\n certain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry s=\r\namith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of g=\r\nhee before giving it as ahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And w=\r\nhat is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Pr=\r\nashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you d=\r\no the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular japa?&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisi=\r\nte like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha.=\r\n (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes =\r\nqualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for ever=\r\ny 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa =\r\n(based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is alread=\r\ny familiar with that book series)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conduc=\r\ntor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt ma=\r\ntter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it stri=\r\nctly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The conversation went onto several other t=\r\nhings. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished se=\r\ner and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in =\r\nhomam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with m=\r\ny spiritual progress since. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether all the hom=\r\na-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to point th=\r\nis out to all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the=\r\n mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ashutosh&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\r\n--0-8469168513-9159020850=:3--\r\n\n"}}
