Chitta Shudhhi \nmust be done. GURU will come to You when you are rea=\r\ndy.\n\nthat is my conviction. When i am ready, my guru will come and even \nif=\r\n some physical entity as Guru never comes, i am not doomed.it \nwon&#39;t stop m=\r\ne from getting the realisation of the self. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaste to all\n&gt; \n&gt; i loved the article on Importance of brahamcharya\n&gt; and =\r\nsimilarly i loved these topics in book AGHORA\n&gt; \n&gt; but i have one serious q=\r\nuestion\n&gt; \n&gt; there too much strenghth is given on Guru\n&gt; but somebody pleas=\r\ne tell me what one should do \n&gt; if he doesn;t have a Guru\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok i may not=\r\n have done some good work in my past life\n&gt; that i should a guru quickly\n&gt; =\r\nbcoz untill i don&#39;t become pure no Guru would accept me\n&gt; and untill i get =\r\na guru, i ll never become pure\n&gt; so.its a vicious circle\n&gt; \n&gt; and when i he=\r\nar be patient you ll find your Guru when time will\n&gt; come i wonder if chang=\r\n dev maharaj had to wait for so many \n&gt; years to get his guru and though he=\r\n was a capable person \n&gt; who could live for so many years evading death(i t=\r\nhink 1400 years)\n&gt;  what if i forget about spirituality in the next \n&gt; 10-1=\r\n5 years(or something wierd happens to my thinking style),\n&gt;  leave about fo=\r\nrgetting it in next births\n&gt; \n&gt; and i m not an advanced Jyotishi and \n&gt; i h=\r\nave no confidence on my calculations\n&gt; and i cant find out my ishta devata =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; so in the end its too confusing\n&gt; (may be that MOTHER wants me too s=\r\ntruggle at present)\n&gt; \n&gt; but yes i liked th line written by narsimha ji\n&gt; &quot;=\r\n&quot;If there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual\n&gt; progress is d=\r\nefinitely *the* thing. One should push one&#39;s free will\n&gt; to the extreme whe=\r\nn it comes to spiritual progress.
