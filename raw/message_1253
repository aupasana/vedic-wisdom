Time Period of 3 days\n\n\n&gt; Dear PVR and Members,\n&gt; I would like to add some thing here to ongoing discussion. A spritual\n&gt; aspirant should start &#39;Puja&#39; or Sadhana without thinking too much of\n&gt; externalities like cleaniness, posture, room, M C etc. As one\n&gt; progresses, one learns what is good for him/her. Such is marvelous\n&gt; way of God, who imparts neccessary and commensurate knowledge to\n&gt; sadhaka. More one is in sadhana, more one learns about correct method\n&gt; of sadhana. What is of utmost importance is &#39;devotion&#39; to god.\n&gt; Greater the devotion, greater degree of learning. This knowledge is\n&gt; built in &#39;SELF&#39; as u progress, self becomes prominent, and thus\n&gt; knowledge thorugh subtle ways is revealed to individual.\n&gt;\n&gt; But above does not discount the importance of formal knowledge of\n&gt; sadhana and puja. That helps a lot. But it sometimes happen that\n&gt; people get bogged down by extenalities.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sanjeev\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Deities are accompanied by various celestial beings. For example,\n&gt; the divine Mother has several attendants (e.g. Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanti,\n&gt; Aparajita etc).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; According to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Mata was born with an\n&gt; amsa of Bagalamukhi and some of his sishyas like Yogin Ma, Golap Ma\n&gt; etc were born with an amsa of Jaya, Vijaya etc. They took care of\n&gt; Sarada Mata. These celestial attendants are born as human beings when\n&gt; god is born as a human being.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As one&#39;s sadhana for a deity progresses, that deity&#39;s attendants\n&gt; may visit one in celestial form (one may or may not realize it).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, one should not think of all these things. It is ok to be\n&gt; aware of the possibilities and, if a result occurs, it is ok to take\n&gt; cognisance of it. But, expecting and looking forward to a result\n&gt; corrupts the sadhana. The sadhana one engages in should be an\n&gt; offering to god without anything *expected* in return. Such sadhana\n&gt; begets the highest fruits.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Moreover, whether one was visited by a deity&#39;s attendants or not is\n&gt; not really a measure of one&#39;s progress. One&#39;s progress is judged from\n&gt; the internal transformation. When someone praises you (correctly or\n&gt; incorrectly, does not matter), does it make you proud? Of course, one\n&gt; may act humble externally and yet feel proud internally. I am talking\n&gt; about the internal feelings here. Similarly, when someone criticizes\n&gt; you (correctly or incorrectly, does not matter), does it make you\n&gt; unhappy or angry? One may not show it externally and yet feel those\n&gt; emotions internally. I am talking about the internal feelings here.\n&gt; Spiritual sadhana is about overcoming internal enemies and weaknesses\n&gt; and reaching the state of sthita prajnataa. Anything else that\n&gt; happens externally is secondary and a coincidence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;   From: Ashwin Rawal\n&gt;&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, February 18, 2009 1:15 PM\n&gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: M.C.

Though most higher deities do not care about this, their\n&gt; attendants may be sensitive. When you do a sadhana, an attendant of a\n&gt; deity may visit at first. One can try to make the visitors\n&gt; comfortable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           However, there may be so many other offensive things\n&gt; where we do sadhana these days and putting too much stress on one\n&gt; little thing is somewhat unbalanced. You can try to follow tradition\n&gt; if that is possible. Otherwise, don&#39;t worry.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Regarding cooking food, the food we eat now-a-days is so\n&gt; badly corrupted in various ways that being cooked by a lady with\n&gt; periods is a very small thing in comparison. Coming into the pooja\n&gt; room is also not a big deal in my view.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           However, when you do homam, I suggest not using food\n&gt; cooked by such a lady if possible. Also I suggest that ladies with\n&gt; periods should not come too close to the fire. These are\n&gt; precautionary suggestions only.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Chandipath is fine. The Mother does not care much about\n&gt; external things.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; ---- ---------\n&gt;&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst\n&gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst\n&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-\n&gt; wisdom\n&gt;&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.\n&gt; home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst\n&gt; rologer.org\n&gt;&gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan\n&gt; nath.org\n&gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; ---- --------- \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;             ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;             From: Ashwin Rawal\n&gt;&gt;             To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;&gt;             Sent: Tuesday, February 17, 2009 12:30 PM\n&gt;&gt;             Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Fw: M.C.
