One who goes round the hill\non Satur=\r\nday shall be rid of the tortures caused by evil spirits and adverse\nplanets=\r\n and becomes the conqueror of the entire universe.*\n\nSignificance of the Be=\r\nacon: Getting rid of the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea and\nturning t=\r\nhe mind inwards and merging it in the Heart to realize the real,\nnon-dual a=\r\nnd effulgent Self, is the real significance of seeing the beacon\nof light o=\r\nn Annamalai, the centre of the universe.\n\nThis Arunachala is destructive of=\r\n all the sins of men through\ncircumambulation prostrations, recollections, =\r\nworships and eulogies.\n\nOn seeing the peak of Arunachala people will not on=\r\nly have the benefit of\nhaving their eyes but also the destruction of all si=\r\nns and the acquisition\nof the vision born of wisdom.\n\nA person desirous of =\r\nsalvation shall stay in the holy place Aruna and\nworship Aruneswara. He sho=\r\nuld repeat the mantra of Arunesvara with great\nrespect. If anyone wishes fo=\r\nr anything he should circumambulate Arunachala\non foot. He shall obtain aus=\r\npiciousness immediately.\n\nWhen one sneezes falters and slips sees and bad d=\r\nream or is highly delighted\nor if a great danger is imminent, the learned m=\r\nan should utter the name of\n=E2=80=98Arunasankara=E2=80=99.\n\nNeither the de=\r\nfects of Kali nor the eruptions of ailments and worries will\nbe present the=\r\nre where the Linga named Arunachala.\n\nHow can the mind go insane or lose it=\r\ns powers on the path of vichara that\nleads to the clarification of consciou=\r\nsness and the attainment of\ntranquility? (Guru Vachaka Kovia 745)\n\nThe loss=\r\n of ego can never be fully and perfectly accomplished by the jivas\nthrough =\r\nsadanas alone. (648)\n\nSo long as distinctions persist in your viewing of th=\r\ne world. Self-abidance\n(Atma-nishta) is indispensable. (765)\n\nSpoken words =\r\nare of no use what soever if the eyes of the Guru Meet the eyes\nif the disc=\r\niple. The highest form of grace is silence. It is also the\nhighest upadesa.=\r\n\n\nKnow the pure state (suddha) as your own real nature, by keenly observing=\r\n\nthe interval between two thoughts. (760)\n\nThat which dwells within as the =\r\nsupreme Self is indeed that which sports\nbefore (you) as pure consciousness=\r\n. (656)\n\nThere are no effective means other than vichara to chase out the e=\r\ngo from\nwithin you and kill it. (885)\n\nThe delusion-filled mind has caused =\r\nsamsara to merge with you. It will cease\nwhen that mind is completely destr=\r\noyed. (920)\n\nThat which is termed omniscience is associated with delusion b=\r\necause in\nreality no kind of objectified knowing exists. (926)\n\nUntil the f=\r\nalse appearance of the snake goes, the underlying truth, the rope\nwill not =\r\nshine. Until the false world-appearance becomes non-existent, the\nunderlyin=\r\ng reality, the truth, the swarupa, will not reveal itself. (876)\n\nTruly vas=\r\nanas are association (sanga). You should therefore know that their\nextincti=\r\non is the total abandonment of all association. (912)\n\nThe Vedas proclaim t=\r\nhat God is omniscient only for the sake of those who are\nconfused thinking =\r\nthat they possess limited knowledge. When carefully\nexamined, (it will be k=\r\nnow that) God does not at any time know anything\nbecause in his very nature=\r\n he is the fullness of being (umnai pooranam).\n(930)\n\nWhatever experiences =\r\nare gained by any being, from any object is nay place,\nif they are enquired=\r\n into, they (the experiences) will be known to really\nfractions of the expe=\r\nrience of the Self. (945)\n\nIf a state is being experienced as something new=\r\n, because that state is not\none=E2=80=99s own, it will definitely go away. =\r\nThe Self that is in the beginning and\nin the end exists in the intervening =\r\ntime also, as that which is. (887)\n\nThe cause of all miseries is the impure=\r\n vasana, the belief that holds the\nbody to be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. (954)\n\nF=\r\neeling anger and hatred in the mind on account of blind fanaticism towards\n=\r\none=E2=80=99s own religion is a cruel and ignoble deed. (991)\n\nUntil the ji=\r\nva knows that its own essential nature is matchless bliss, it\nwill, like th=\r\ne must deer, be confused. (1028)\n\nThose who are experiencing the excellent =\r\nbliss of samadhi knowing their real\nname, will not get deluded by what is f=\r\nalse and then seek objects perceived\nby the five senses. (947)\n\nSince mauna=\r\n (stillness of mind) the culmination of knowledge, is their\ncommon nature, =\r\nall religions are acceptable as a means to advaitic truth,\nwhich shines uni=\r\nque and pure, they are therefore not opposed to the\nwonderful Vedanta (endi=\r\nng of knowledge). (989)\n\nUnlike a blossoming lotus that closed (during the =\r\nnight), the Heart-lotus\nwhich has blossomed after the untying of the ignobl=\r\ne knot, will never close\nagain. (1124)\n\nNothing happens except that which i=\r\ns divinely ordained. Consequently it is\npointless for people (who want the =\r\nworld to be different) to experience\nanxiety and to be debilitated by distr=\r\ness. (1191)\n\nGod, the extremely intense, true and supreme grace, takes ten =\r\nsteps\n(towards) the devotee) when the devotee takes one step (towards God).=\r\n (965)\n\nLooking at you from within the Self, I never leave you. How can thi=\r\ns fact be\nknown to your externalized vision. (Sri Bhagavan, 966)\n\nThe teach=\r\nings of true jnanis who are established in the experience (of the\nSelf) wil=\r\nl bestow the light of truth on those who mediate on them (the\nteachings) in=\r\n their heart. (1159)\n\nOther than by hearing and knowing it from the lips of=\r\n those who have seen\nand known it, we know of no other =E2=80=98royal road =\r\nto realizing jnana.=E2=80=99 (1158)\n\nWhen enduring true bliss exists and fi=\r\nles the heart to the brim, it is an\nerror of ego to fell distress. (969)\n\nK=\r\nnow that suffering is only in the bewildered vision of the jiva that has\nbe=\r\nen grabbed by the stupidity of becoming attached to the false ego. (952)\n\nS=\r\no long as you are seeking something other than yourself as the agent for\nga=\r\nining bliss, there is no bliss of you. (1026)\n\nOnly as long as the mind sur=\r\nvived will there be religion. When the mind\nattains silence, religion also =\r\nwill cease. (993)\n\nNothing that is worth grieving over ever happens to you.=\r\n Examine your real\nnature. (953)\n\nThe radiance of consciousness-bliss in th=\r\ne form of one awareness shining in\nthe same way within and without is the s=\r\nupreme and blissful primal reality\nwhose form in silence and which is decla=\r\nred by jnanis to be the final and\nincontrovertible state of true knowledge.=\r\n (901)\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016364c7d85d696d604860e1877\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe real nature of this Arunachala Hill the ocean of grace divin=\r\ne, is to bestow liberation on those who contemplates on it in their heart.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One who circumambulates this holy hill, on Sunday becomes liberat=\r\ned.

(920)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That which is termed omniscience=\r\n is associated with delusion because in reality no kind of objectified know=\r\ning exists.
