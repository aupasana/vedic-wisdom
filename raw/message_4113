Kapila&#39;s Sa=\r\nankhya - Enumeration and Analysis of the Universe, is primarily based on th=\r\ne foundation that the &#39;world is full of miseries&#39;. \n\nEnclosed below is a su=\r\nccint, blurb of Saankhya philosophy found on the Internet (Bless Raghav&#39;s s=\r\noul). The question being &#39;why did Sage Kapila atrribute the world to be ful=\r\nl of miseries?&#39; The concluding sentence from the author of the blurb, opens=\r\n up another question:\n\n&#39;Thus there in all 25 categories which are Prakriti =\r\nand its 23 evolutes and purusha.&#39;: are the 23 evolutes &#39;our chromosomes&#39;?\n\n=\r\nTvameham!\n- Sudhakar\n\nWith Punctuations, and paragraph editing for easier r=\r\neading.\n****************************************************************\nTh=\r\ne Sankhya explanation of the world lies in Purusha and Prakriti. Through th=\r\ne union of two the world evolves as we know it.\n\nPurusha: Purusha is the se=\r\nlf. In Sankhya philosophy the self is pure consciousness. Coming into touch=\r\n with it gives unity to to all the movements of the knowledge composites of=\r\n subtle stuff, which would otherwise have remained aimless and unintelligen=\r\nt. \n\nIt is coming into touch with this principle of intelligence that they =\r\nare intrepreted as a systematic and coherent experience of a person and may=\r\n thus be said to be intelligized. \n\nIntelligizing means the expression and =\r\nintrepretation of events or the happenings of knowledge in connection with =\r\na person, so as to make them a system of expression. \n\nThis principle of in=\r\ntelligence is called Purusha. This was the epistemic significance of Purush=\r\na. Metaphysically these purushas are all pervading and are many. When they =\r\ncome into contact with prakriti, prakriti evolves into the world through 23=\r\n evolutes.\n\n                      * * * * *\n\nPrakriti: Prakriti is the pote=\r\nntial world. According to the Sankhya theory of causation the effect is pre=\r\n existent in the cause, and producing an effect means removal of obstructio=\r\nns of manifestation of the effect. With purusha in contact with prakriti th=\r\ne world which was in its potential state evolves into its actual state. \n\n =\r\n                     * * * * *\n\nIt is also necessary to understand here the=\r\n Sankhya theory of Gunas. According to Sankhya what we call matter complexe=\r\ns become at a certain stage feeling complexes and what we call feeling comp=\r\nlexes become at a certain stage mere matter complexes with matter reaction.=\r\n \n\nIf we should analyze any percept into crude and undeveloped sensations o=\r\nf which it is composed at the first moment of its appearance, it comes as a=\r\n shock than as an image. Even in our ordinary life; elements which precede =\r\nan act of knowledge are probably mere feelings. \n\nAs we go lower down in th=\r\ne scale of evolution, the automatic actions and reactions of matter are con=\r\ncomitant with crude manifestations of feeling which never rise to the level=\r\n of knowledge. The lower the scale of evolution the less keeness of feeling=\r\n, till at last comes a stage where matter complexes do not give rise to fee=\r\nling but to mere physical reactions. The feelings are therefore things in t=\r\nhemselves, the ultimate substances of which consciousness, gross and matter=\r\n are made up of. \n\n                      * * * * *\n\nOrdinarily, it may soun=\r\nd crude to take feelings for ultimate substances; but in Sankhya analysis, =\r\nthought and matter are but two modifications of certain subtle substances w=\r\nhich are in essence but three type of feeling entities. \nThere are three ty=\r\npes of feelings usually: pleasure, pain and dullness which are the manifest=\r\nations of three types of feeling substances regarded as ultimate entities c=\r\nalled :sattva, rajas and tamas (gunas) respectively. \n\nNow, before this wor=\r\nld came into being there was a certain state in which the guna compounds ha=\r\nd disintegrated into a state of disunion and had by their mutual opposition=\r\n produced a state of equilibrium called prakriti. Then due to proximity of =\r\npurusha a disturbance occured in prakriti and as a result it brought forth =\r\na creation of manifold. Prakriti thus is a state of perfect homogeneity and=\r\n incoherence of the gunas, thus gradually evolved and become more and more =\r\ndeterminate, differentaited, heterogenous and coherent. The gunas are alway=\r\ns uniting, separating and uniting again.\n\nIn the phenomenal product whateve=\r\nr energy there is; is product of rajas: all resistance, stability: is due t=\r\no tamas, and all conscious manifestation: due to sattva. When one guna is p=\r\nreponderant in any particular collocation, the others are co operant. \n\n   =\r\n                   * * * * *\n\nEvolution: The gunas when once thrown off bal=\r\nance try to group themselves again togther in one form, then another and so=\r\n on, to restore equilibrium, when it is restored it is called pralaya. \n\nWh=\r\nen one evolute is produced from another; this second stage is the result of=\r\n some of the reals of the first stage. The defeciency of the first stage wh=\r\nich had gone forth to form new aggregate as the second stage is made good b=\r\ny refilling from prakriti and so on in the third stage and by a succession =\r\nof refillings the process of evolution proceeds till we come to a stage whe=\r\nn no new substance can be evolved. \n\nThe first evolute of prakriti is mahat=\r\n. This is indeed the earliest state from which the world has sprung forth; =\r\nand it is a state in which sattva predominates. It holds within itself the =\r\nbuddhi of all purushas which were lost in the prakriti during the pralaya. =\r\nThe very first work of prakriti is thus manifested by separating out of the=\r\n old buddhis or minds which hold within themselves specific avidya inhenren=\r\nt in them with reference to each purusha. This state of evolution consistin=\r\ng of all collected buddhis is called buddhitattva. \n\n                      =\r\n* * * * * \nLooked at from this point of view; it is the widest and universa=\r\nl existence comprising all creation and it is thus called mahat (the great =\r\none). \n\nThe mahat tattva once being produced; further modifications take pl=\r\nace. Mahat is now disturbed by three parallel tendencies of a preponderence=\r\n of sattva, rajas and tamas and is called ahamkara and the latter mentioned=\r\n tendencies are called tamasika ahamkara (bhutadi), rajasika ahamkara (taij=\r\nasa ahamkara) and vaikarika ahamkara.\n\nThe ego or ahamkara are specific exp=\r\nressions of general consciousness which takes experience as mine. The funct=\r\nion of ego is therefore called abimaana (self assertion). The sattvik ahamk=\r\nara produces manas or mind which is transclucent and gives rise to the spec=\r\nific notion of egohood. From bhutadi ahamkara through the help of rajas are=\r\n generated the tan matras, the immediately preceding causes of gross elemen=\r\nts. These tan matras are sabda tanmatra (the sound potential), Vayu tanmatr=\r\na (touch potential), rupa tanmatra (colour potential), rasa tanmatra (taste=\r\n potential) and gandha tanmatra (smell potential). The sound potential with=\r\n accretion of rudiment matter from bhutadi generates akasha or ether. Throu=\r\ngh such constant co mingling the atoms and then the gross elements are prod=\r\nuced.\n\n                      * * * * *\n\nPurusha and Prakriti: Purusha due t=\r\no his contact with prakriti falsely identifies himself with the evolutes of=\r\n prakriti. He thinks he is a limited being, conditioned by mind and body, u=\r\nnaware of his true nature. \n\nThe knowledge that he is different from mind a=\r\nnd body produces liberation. This knowledge is attained through continuous =\r\ndiscrimination between purusha and prakriti. There is an inherent teleology=\r\n or blind purpose in the lifeless prakriti, that all its evolution and tran=\r\nsformations take place for the sake of purusha, to produce various kinds of=\r\n experiences for him and finally leading him to liberation or mukti.\n\nThus =\r\nthere in all 25 categories which are Prakriti and its 23 evolutes and purus=\r\nha.\n\n                      * * * * * \n\n\n\n"}}
