Tryambaka is the \nname of Lord Shiva as the=\r\n father of the three worlds - bhu, bhuva \nand svarga lokas. He is the fathe=\r\nr and lord of the three mandala&#39;s - \nSurya, Soma and Agni mandala. He is Ma=\r\nheswara, the lord of the three \nGuna&#39;s - Satva, Rajas and Tamas. He is the =\r\nSadashiva, the teacher of \nthe three tatvas - Atma tatva, Vidya tatva and S=\r\nhiva tatva. He is \nthe father (cause and source) of the three energies (agn=\r\ni) - \nAavahaniya, Garhapatya and Dakshinagni. He is the father of all \nphys=\r\nical creation through the three murti bhuta - Prithvi (solid), \nJala (liqui=\r\nd) and Tejas or agni (energy). He is the lord of the \nthree heavens created=\r\n by the dominance of the three Gunas - Rajas \n(Brahma), Satva (Vishnu) and =\r\nTamas (Shiva). Know Him to be the \nnirakara (formless) Sadashiva as He is a=\r\nbove this physical mode and \nis their Maheswara. This is the first foot of =\r\nthe mantra (composed \nof eight syllables).&quot;\n\n&quot;The second pada of the mantra=\r\n,&quot; continued Sukracharya, &quot;is \nSugandhim Pushtivardhanam. Sugandhim refers =\r\nto the fragrance of the \nflower that spreads in all directions, and in a si=\r\nmilar way Shiva is \npresent in the entire creation, both animate and inanim=\r\nate. In all \nthe bhutas (modes of existence), in the three Gunas (nature of=\r\n \ncreation as being Satva, Rajas or Tamas), in the ten indriyas (five \ngyan=\r\na-indriyas or senses and five karma-indriyas or organs of \naction), in all =\r\nthe devas (33 devas are the source of all \nillumination and enlightenment) =\r\nand the ganas (hosts of demi-gods), \nShiva exists and pervades as the illum=\r\nine atma (soul) and is their \nessence. Pustivardhanam is now being explaine=\r\nd. That inward dwelling \nspirit (atman), the Purusha Shiva is the real sust=\r\nainer of Prakriti \n(and not vice-versa as all people perceive). Starting wi=\r\nth the \nmahatatva (primordial state of matter/energy) to the individual \npa=\r\nrts of creation, the entire sustenance of the physically created \nbeings (b=\r\noth animate and inanimate) is done by the imperishable \nPurusha. You, I, Br=\r\nahma, Vishnu, the Munis and even Indra & devas \nare maintained/sustaine d (=\r\nby the atma and that is Him). Since the \nPurusha (atma - Shiva) is the gran=\r\nter of sustenance to prakriti \n(body/nature) , he is &#39;Pusti-vardhana&#39; .&quot;\n\nH=\r\naving explained the first two pada of the mantra, Sukracharya \ncontinued to=\r\n explain the remaining two pada. He said &quot; the next two \npada (consisting o=\r\nf sixteen syllables) is Urvarukamiva Bandhanam \nMrityormukshiya mamritat me=\r\naning - Prabhu! just as the ripe cucumber \nis severed from the bondage of t=\r\nhe creeper, in the same manner may \nwe be delivered from death for the sake=\r\n of immortality (moksha). \nRudra deva is like amrita (nectar of immortality=\r\n) . Those who worship \nHim with good karma, penance and repentance, meditat=\r\nion, \ncontemplation, prayer or praise, will surely renewed life and vigor. =\r\n\nThe strength of truth force (in this mantra) is such that Lord Shiva \nshal=\r\nl definitely free the worshipper from the bondage of death \nbecause Shiva a=\r\nlone is the giver of bondage and moksha. \n\nThis is the Mritasanjivani mantr=\r\na and has the power to give back \nlife and rescue from death and great evil=\r\ns. You should adore Lord \nShiva and recite this mantra. Water sanctified wi=\r\nth this mantra \nshould be drunk all the time. [Authors note: It is well kno=\r\nwn that \nthe rudraksha bead is placed in a glass of water after being held =\r\nin \nthe palm during the recitation of the mantra. this water is drunk \nduri=\r\nng the day.]\n\nOblations in the sacrificial fire with this mantra is very \np=\r\nurifying.
