Advaita schools assert the monistic=\r\n view that the individual soul and God are one and the same[7], whereas Dva=\r\nita schools give the dualistic argument that the individual soul and God ar=\r\ne eternally separate[8]. The philosophy of Achintya-bheda-abheda includes e=\r\nlements of both viewpoints. The living soul is intrinsically linked with th=\r\ne Supreme Lord, and yet at the same time is not the same as God - the exact=\r\n nature of this relationship being inconceivable to the human mind.&quot;\n \nIn y=\r\nour spiritual studies have you ever come across this concept of Achintya Bh=\r\neda Abheda? Here are some quick links:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achintya=\r\n_Bheda_Abheda http://www.harekrsna.com/philosophy/bmgs/caitanya/tattva.htm =\r\n For some years I have really wanted to ask your thoughts on this...

Some objects =\r\nappear &quot;beautiful&quot; and some &quot;ugly&quot;. Some objects and experiences give &quot;happ=\r\niness&quot; and some &quot;sadness&quot;. Some words are seen as &quot;praise&quot; and some as &quot;cri=\r\nticism&quot;. Some experiences cause &quot;pleasure&quot; and some &quot;pain&quot;. Some objects an=\r\nd experiences are seen as &quot;desirable&quot; and some as &quot;undesirable&quot;. And so on.=\r\n\n \nNon-duality is a state where there are no such distinctions. There is ju=\r\nst a Brahman in that state.\n \nThe state of non-duality is reached by people=\r\n who reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Most of the time, what most people experienc=\r\ne is the state of duality.

There was a Telepho=\r\nne exchange just opposite to Post&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2?Tt; =\r\nI had friendship with some&gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbh=\r\nai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. H=\r\ne was a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 shri&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I=\r\n was meeting him he was always talking&gt; &gt; &gt; about&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We ca=\r\nme close day by day. There was a weekly&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home c=\r\nalled SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created&gt; &gt; &gt; by&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him =\r\nand was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita.=\r\n We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on S=\r\naturday evening. I was then 24 years old.

I was very much impressed about&gt; &gt; &gt; him.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He c=\r\nould foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&gt; &gt; &gt; he&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was&gt; &gt; &gt; punctur=\r\ned&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made=\r\n me to believe that he had some super&gt; &gt; &gt; power&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to=\r\n Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day=\r\n I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day cam=\r\ne. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&gt; &gt; &gt; myself&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at M=\r\nr. Patel=E2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed&gt; &gt; &gt; him&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply=\r\n from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his&gt; &gt; &gt; grace.&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; while taking the tea.

His followers have done a very good job of putting =\r\nup the web&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; site and sharing the information for free both audi=\r\no and books.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Chiti Leela or the play of Shakti or=\r\n God is very complex, Ramakrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may have taken birth as more=\r\n than one person and in future may take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; more births.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others use=\r\n pardon my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifes=\r\nt from time to time&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After reading this and other books, I feel=\r\n that each one of us has a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; inner guru along with our atma and =\r\nthis inner guru in conjunction with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our accumulated or sanchit=\r\n sankaras give us visions of these mahatmas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or help us attach =\r\nor attract to a Saint or some aspects of the saint&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; more than o=\r\nthers. This inner guru is the same in all humam beings but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; man=\r\nifests uniquely based on each person.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I also beli=\r\neve that one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; present i=\r\nn physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There=\r\n are many instances of other forms of inititations like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; initia=\r\ntion in dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; i=\r\nnitiations though very important are very rare or uncommon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some quest=\r\nions pop up in my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind about him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1)=\r\n What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have guided many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; 2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after=\r\n that?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the mid=\r\ndle of giving&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spirtual talks? It seems unusual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have also read somewhere that once a person reaches a spiritu=\r\nal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for more than few day=\r\ns, was this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the case?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; May be others =\r\nwho have read this book can share more light.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I do recommend t=\r\no seekers of spirutuality to read this book if one has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time, i=\r\nt is available for free to download as a pdf book on his web&lt;BR&gt;&gt; site.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for th=\r\ne betterment and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellk=\r\nnown. He spread the Devi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra/homa and other things =\r\nin a big way all around india.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I feel like I have=\r\n not even begun my spiritual journey which is very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; very long t=\r\noo and many obstacles in the path.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; B=\r\nest Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mitesh&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Another as intresting as well as equally =\r\nconfusing thing is that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati=\r\n yogi) had also revealtion about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his past life and he als=\r\no indirectly indicated in his biography that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he was Thaku=\r\nr Ramkrishna in the previous birth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You=\r\nrs,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; I know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinji=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; I would like to mention something that may be an interesting&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; insight.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram =\r\nSharma Acharya.

This is an =\r\nunbelievable experience that I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have not =\r\nadded anything from my own. I am writing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only wh=\r\nen you are in religious mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7=\r\n pm and I was getting late fee allowance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2?Tt; I had friendship =\r\nwith some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One=\r\n Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 shri&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always =\r\ntalking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came=\r\n close day by day. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs =\r\ncreated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping whi=\r\nle singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We=\r\n 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Pat=\r\nel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore da=\r\nily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only a=\r\nbout Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore =\r\nhe suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call =\r\nme. I shall have to go now=E2?=9D. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a pl=\r\nane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also h=\r\nappened. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by B=\r\nus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through b=\r\nus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus=\r\n station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; puncture=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishand=\r\nev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One=\r\n day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2?Ts house befor=\r\ne Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dee=\r\nply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion=\r\n with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. =\r\nAs my duty was to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I ha=\r\nve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wif=\r\ne was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with =\r\nme a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy should you take such a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; deci=\r\nsion?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kal=\r\ni at Calcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Sain=\r\nt but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gi=\r\nve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shr=\r\ni Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are=\r\n doing Gayatri Mantra=E2?=9D--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments w=\r\nere right at her place as people in general not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I =\r\nhave taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of=\r\n Mr. Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel ha=\r\nd told me that Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to=\r\n test him before accepting him. I also decided to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; te=\r\nst Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also=\r\n not seen him. He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nme where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe tha=\r\nt my selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2?=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2?oHow it is possible? I don=\r\n=E2?Tt believe.=E2?=9D-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I p=\r\nrayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2?~I want to test your existence=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what h=\r\nappened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just =\r\ncome to my home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to=\r\n sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my b=\r\nlanket and told me that-=E2?o Go to your friend=E2?Ts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hou=\r\nse. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I wi=\r\nll show you his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; house=E2?=9D&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you w=\r\nant? Why you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him in=\r\n such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget =\r\nthat 5th April, a miracle day in my life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I wil=\r\nl&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it sometime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth.
