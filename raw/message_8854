Does every spiritual activity merely try to entice t=\r\nhe common person with material gains but has a hidden purpose of liberating=\r\n the mind of desires? (which is the only tangible result experienced from a=\r\n sadhana) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. If the 4th point is true then prayer, homa, devotion, =\r\ngood deeds, austerities, penance, etc. are all hitting around the bush. The=\r\n root is in our own self. Absolute vigilance on&nbsp; self is all that is n=\r\needed to realise liberty and manifest at will ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your =\r\ntime and patience &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With regards, &lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body=\r\n&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1599440549-180564685-1355287527=:97876--\r\n\n"}}
