But =\r\nwhen Mumbai-based Muslim industrialist, \n&gt; Ashik Ali Nathani saw its terrib=\r\nle condition, he was inspired to revamp \n&gt; the temple as a means to promote=\r\n communal harmony.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It was Ganpati Bappa and our 33 crore deities who =\r\ninspired me. Through \n&gt; their help and the blessings of Allah, I&#39;ve been ab=\r\nle to accomplish this \n&gt; mission. I don&#39;t see any difference between a temp=\r\nle and mosque, they \n&gt; are all places of worship,&quot; said Ashik Ali Nathani.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though, some purists attacked the move as promoting idol worship =\r\n\n&gt; which is prohibited under Islam, Nathani refused to budge and employed \n=\r\n&gt; some of the finest artisans and spent over Rs. two crore to restore the \n=\r\n&gt; temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; And his deed has brought him accolades from all those who ha=\r\nve come to \n&gt; know of his work.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;From a humanist viewpoint and to prom=\r\note goodwill among Hindus and \n&gt; Muslims, he has set a really special examp=\r\nle for us,&quot; said one person, \n&gt; while the other said, &quot;From his work, we ne=\r\ned to learn that Hindus and \n&gt; Muslims are one and we should never fight am=\r\nong ourselves.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Now enthused by this positive response Nathani has als=\r\no promised to open \n&gt; a school and a hospital to serve people in this area.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The whole event is a reflection of the deep roots of India&#39;s composit=\r\ne \n&gt; culture. And no matter what efforts are made to polarise communities, =\r\n\n&gt; this temple will now inspire generations to build bonds of brotherhood \n=\r\n&gt; beyond religious boundaries.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
