I am curious to know at what point testing begins. What if a =\r\nsadhak fails? How severely does he get punished? Finally can god whom we pr=\r\nay so much punish us so badly.\n\nThere are people who feel the need of guru.=\r\n I feel like sharing something about my experience with respect to it. I ha=\r\nve a small side business and any money I get from it gives me happiness as =\r\nlot of hard work is involved. When I started the homam it was  doing ok bus=\r\niness. After starting homam the business picked up. Oneday I got vulgar tho=\r\nughts in mind and the business went down immediately. I found out my mistak=\r\ne worked on it. My business picked up again then I started getting greedy f=\r\nor more money. Down went the business again. I worked on controlling my min=\r\nd towards temptation of money. Business picked up again. After a very long =\r\ntime I had a heavy fight with my husband the other day hurled abuses and no=\r\nw my business is down again. I know this time God wants me to work on anger=\r\n.\nHow beautifully God is acting guru and taming me? Simply amazing!!\n\nRegar=\r\nds,\nPriya\n\n\n\n"}}
