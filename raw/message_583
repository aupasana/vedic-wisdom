It is thrown away. If you live in woods, throw it away \nin the open so animals can eat it. Otheriwse, throw it in garbage.\n\nOn the other hand, &quot;naivedyam&quot; offered to god can be consumed by people as \nprasad.\n\n(2) Either is fine. They symbolize the path of shakti moving from you to the \nfire and vice versa.\n\n(3) Either is fine.\n\n(4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas used in a pooja, everything \nhas a purpose and it has to go when its purpose is served. That&#39;s the nature \nof life. While the flowers and akshatas are used in homam, they are \nsacrosanct and should be handled with care, love and respect. After they \nserve their purpose, they have to be disposed of however one can. Throwing \nin garbage is fine if you ask me. Another way is to collect them in a bag \nuntil you accumulate a good amount and burn them oneday. If you have a local \ntemple, you can go and see if you can throw them wherever they throw the \nflowers etc they use at the temple.\n\nThe ashes from the homam are considered sacred. They contain *some* of the \nenergy generated from the homam. The best way to dispose the ashes is to \nthrow them into a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean). This \nensures that the energy is not localized to one place and is distributed \nback to the Nature. Another thing some people do is to dig a deep pit in the \nyard and bury the ashes. It restricts the energy to the place and not a \ngreat idea. Please remember that the energy in the ashes is only a *part* of \nthe energy generated. Some energy is also within the person performing homam \nand helps to purify the person. Giving some part back to the nature is a \nvery good idea.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, November 01, 2008 7:18 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] questions w.r.t. Homam!!!\n\n\n&gt; Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; my Apology for sending the Jyotisha content in this forum.\n&gt;\n&gt; few questions are arising while doing Homam which is listed as under;\n&gt;\n&gt; 1)&#39;Suddhaanna Bali&#39; offerings for Parshadas can be consumed later on\n&gt; by people as Prasad?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) &#39;Two parallel lines&#39; from Homam Kund to Aaasan can be permanent\n&gt; or required to draw fresh everytime? what does those lines mean?\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) &#39;Remains in Homa Kunad&#39; can be used as *Raksha* or Raksha is only\n&gt; considered which is obtained from the procedure given.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) The problem of disposal of Nirmaalya (Remains of Homam-such as\n&gt; flowers, Akshataas, etc..)is a issue especially in the city where i\n&gt; stay, due to local restrictions. to put it in a normal garbage is\n&gt; difficult physcologically. any suggetions from anybody?\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; I need to share my experience about Dry coconut pieces. If one takes\n&gt; a Dray coconut Half and presses it by holding in both Palms, it&#39;ll\n&gt; break in to 3 to 4 pieces. if required, one can further make one or\n&gt; two pieces from those again by breaking it by using palms. I&#39;ve\n&gt; experinced that those pieces works out to be very useful (Size wise)\n&gt; to sustain fire for long time hence one can concentrate more in\n&gt; reciting Mantra then worrying about sustainance of fire. the another\n&gt; important advantage is that use of Knife can be completely avoided.\n&gt;\n&gt; just one input if it helps some..\n&gt;\n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; utpal\n\n\n"}}
