Grahas are personification of qualities that \ngrasp one&#39;s consciousness and thinking based on previous conditioning.\n\nMars is personification of the spirit of initiative, enthusiasm and energy. \nOf course, he can grant one&#39;s desires.\n\nPlanets are self-realized and liberated from the cycle of life and death, \ni.e. they are jeevanmuktas. From that point of view, rishis, gods like \nBrahma, Vishnu and Shiva and planets are similar. They are liberated and \ncontinue to discharge their duties till the pre-ordained time period without \nbeing deluded by duality, and merge in Brahman at the end of that time \nperiod. During that period, they may exist in multiple forms, be reborn and \nwhat not.\n\nThey are doing their duty/dharma without any attachment whatsoever.\n\nPlanets are also deities and they have a specific job of grasping people&#39;s \nconsciousness and give them different thoughts and experiences, based on \ntheir previous karmas.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 06, 2009 5:09 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on planets\n\n\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; As I was reading the homa manul for Kuja I came across a definition of\n&gt; one of the 21 names of Kuja as one who can grant all wishes etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some days back I was re reading the Aghora book where it was mentioned\n&gt; at place that the planets are like munis. Is this true?\n&gt;\n&gt; Then what is the difference between a planet and a deity? Also why are\n&gt; they called graha?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
