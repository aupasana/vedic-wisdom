Around=\r\n Navaratri this year I \n&gt; have completed a 108 times recitation of chandipa=\r\nth over two/three \n&gt; months and that was indeed one of the best periods of =\r\nmy life so far. \n&gt; Although there is nothing that manifested in terms of ma=\r\nterial benefits, \n&gt; my overall mood was pretty elevated/calm most of the ti=\r\nme. After that, \n&gt; however I am not able to practise it so much and I don&#39;t=\r\n enjoy that same \n&gt; bliss anymore. But whenever I do Chandipath, that day i=\r\nn general my \n&gt; mental state is pretty calm. However, it is a tough sadhana=\r\n to do \n&gt; everyday. The Path alone takes around an hour to recite, that too=\r\n if you \n&gt; superfast, which you are not supposed to, according to the book.=\r\n If you \n&gt; recite at comfortable speed, it takes around 1 hour 20 minutes j=\r\nust for \n&gt; the 13 chapters. Add the kavacham, argala, keelaka, ratrisuktam,=\r\n \n&gt; artharvaseersham before and devi sooktam, three  rahasyams, kshama \n&gt; p=\r\nrathana and siddha kunjika strotram you are taking 2 to 2.5 hours. For \n&gt; m=\r\ne that seems impossible on a daily basis. So, I have tried to do 2/3 \n&gt; cha=\r\npters a day for daily practise but that does not give me the same \n&gt; bliss =\r\nthat I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So, I don&#39;t know how to \n&gt; practise=\r\n this regularly on a permanent basis. Any inputs from you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- On Sat, 11/19/11, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Why Sapthsh=\r\nati mantras is called Siddha \n&gt; mantra?\n&gt; To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Saturday, November 19, 2011, 1:03 =\r\nPM\n&gt; \n&gt;     Dear Rakesh,\n&gt; \n&gt; The ChandiPath is a text which can bestow all=\r\n the four aims of life as \n&gt; mentioned in scriptures - Dharma, Artha, Kama =\r\nand Moskha. One who does a \n&gt; Chandipath thrice a day for a few years at le=\r\nasts,  ends up transforming \n&gt; himself completely from being an ordinary, a=\r\nverage, limited, frail human \n&gt; being to a &#39;god&#39; of sorts. Our religion tea=\r\nches the transformation of \n&gt; how a man becomes a god. Not G-d but god.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Strength, courage, confidence, devotion, knowledge, application of \n&gt; spe=\r\ncial knowledge, authority (if one so desires it), power, wisdom, \n&gt; spiritu=\r\nal experiences, liberation, enlightenment etc - everything comes \n&gt; from th=\r\nis one text. It is a whole package.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually you get what you crave =\r\nfor deep down. It is not too difficult \n&gt; to master the text. Some effort, =\r\nsome patience and it can be done. Spend \n&gt; one hour daily practicing the te=\r\nxt and in 3 months you can read it \n&gt; whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best of luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regar=\r\nds\n&gt;   Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: A small word of caution. Maybe not relevant right =\r\nnow, but if ever \n&gt; by Her will you become an accomplished Chandi sadhaka i=\r\nn future then \n&gt; this will be of help. Don&#39;t ask for anything when doing He=\r\nr worship is \n&gt; an ideal situation. If you pray simply as you pray in any t=\r\nemple, then \n&gt; too there is not a problem. Praying with humility is never a=\r\n problem. \n&gt; BUT if ever you try out kriyas with Chandi or do the Chandipat=\r\nh to get \n&gt; xyz results in abc timeframe, (specially during complex forms o=\r\nf worship \n&gt; of Chandi like those involving charnel grounds), then be sure =\r\nthat you \n&gt; know the precise and exact procedures. There are no half measur=\r\nes in \n&gt; those. Nishkama worship in complex methods is fine, but desire for=\r\n \n&gt; material results without the knowledge of the procedures during complex=\r\n \n&gt; rituals in begging for trouble, whoever you might be.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ami Jantr=\r\na Tumi Jantri\n&gt; Ami Ghar Tumi Gharani\n&gt; \n&gt; Ami Ratha Tumi Rathi\n&gt; Jemon Cha=\r\nlao Temni Chali\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: r=\r\nakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: W=\r\nednesday, 16 November 2011 11:09 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Why Sapth=\r\nshati mantras is called Siddha \n&gt; mantra?\n&gt; \n&gt;    Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can u=\r\n pls elaborate about durga sapathshati, its benefits, and uses in \n&gt; genera=\r\nl man life, also if i have to start reading chapters menas \n&gt; increasing on=\r\ne by one so pls tell me imortance viz how should i increase\n&gt; \n&gt; 1] 1 m ful=\r\nly comfortable in reading chap 11, now started reading 2, 4,5\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n=\r\n&gt; Rakesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;http://us.mc829.mail.=\r\nyahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; , rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Priyank, =C3=82  The document refers t=\r\no samputikaran mantras for the \n&gt; &gt; Chandi. Samputikaran is a process by wh=\r\nich you prefix or suffix \n&gt; &gt; certain mantras to some texts or other mantra=\r\ns to derive certain \n&gt; &gt; specific results out of it. =C3=82  There are many=\r\n more samput mantras for \n&gt; &gt; Chandi apart from what that document lists.  =\r\nYes, the Chandi is a \n&gt; &gt; siddha text. Siddha in the sense of being &quot;accomp=\r\nlished for Self \n&gt; &gt; realization&quot; as well as &quot;siddhis&quot;, depending on the in=\r\nclination and \n&gt; &gt; capacity of the sadhaka and of course Her will.\n&gt; &gt; To u=\r\nnderstand why it is so, one has to do sadhana and keep praying to \n&gt; &gt; Her.=\r\n Intellectual comprehension falls flat beyond a point. It is plain \n&gt; &gt; use=\r\nless.=C3=82 And the sadhana is not a one day/few months/one year or few \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; years process. It is=C3=82 like an endless ocean, there are simply no \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; limits except for the ones you set for yourself in your own mind.
