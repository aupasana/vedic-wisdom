I am using Baraha Unicode software. Any way, I have t=\r\no type completely, since Baraha is not supporting vedic swaras for Tamil la=\r\nnguage (Tamil language has its own limitations for subtle sounds) and I hav=\r\ne to find suitable/ subtle ways to get the same word to get the same pronou=\r\nnciation. This document will be a quick reference guide (or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;) =\r\ncontaining only mantras and no instructions. I will send the same to Narasi=\r\nmha before end of the week so that he can publish it in his website. He can=\r\n also add it to the main manual.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Shankar\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

The instruct=\r\nions and explanations continue to be in English, but the mantras are writte=\r\nn in these languages for ease of reading.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We have also made a=\r\nvailable a quick reference guide (or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;) containing only mantras=\r\n and no instructions. If you already read the manual and feel comfortable w=\r\nith the procedure and only want a printout of mantras to refer to, you can =\r\ndownload it and use it. It is also available for Mahaganapathi homam and Sh=\r\niva homam in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit and English scripts.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just go to the homam website below and go to Mahaganapathi homam =\r\nor Shiva homam link to download these additions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Other homam =\r\nmanuals will also be available in this format soon.

They have=\r\n Vedic swaras available only in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. If you want =\r\nthe manual in any other Indian language, please send a nice note requesting=\r\n the friendly developers of baraha o add support for vedic swaras in that l=\r\nanguage. As they add this support in other languages, we will create more h=\r\nomam manuals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the long run, I want manuals to be fully tra=\r\nnslated to various Indian languages, i.e. instructions and explanations als=\r\no in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc. But that may take a long time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
