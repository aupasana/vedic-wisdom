If that can be given in the=\r\n fire, nothing like it! Let me elaborate a bit \n&gt; more on the last portion =\r\nof the below mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally we do a homa in a homa kunda which is plac=\r\ned on the floor. The gap - \n&gt; physical distance - between the person doing =\r\nthe homa and the kunda is not too \n&gt; big. In such circumstances it is good =\r\nto be a little cautious while giving a \n&gt; full coconut. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0If s=\r\nomeone has a fire pit dug, or the homa-kunda base is resonably=C2=A0below t=\r\nhe \n&gt; surface level where one is sitting, that is ideal for giving a coconu=\r\nt in fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0I used to give a whole coconut (sometimes 2 coconuts)=\r\n=C2=A0in my normal homa kunda \n&gt; (16 inchx 16 inch). The coconut would take=\r\n at least one and half hours to burn \n&gt; properly. I would use that time to =\r\nmeditate, while pouring ghee on the coconut \n&gt; at frequent intervals. But t=\r\nhe coconut will at one point spurt hot water. \n&gt; Normally it will spray and=\r\n=C2=A0diffuse the fire,=C2=A0so keep enough ghee and camphor \n&gt; ready!=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes however=C2=A0the water may=C2=A0get=C2=A0sprayed=C2=A0on=\r\n the body of the person. That is \n&gt; why it is best if there is some reasona=\r\nble gap between the person and the homa \n&gt; kunda, like in a fire pit. Prefe=\r\nr large coconuts than smaller ones. Large ones \n&gt; are easier to control in =\r\nfire. Smaller coconuts are more unpredictable. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On a different note=\r\n, I have had a few occassions when coconuts have burst \n&gt; uncomfortably in =\r\nthe kunda spraying water on me. Once my face got scalded such \n&gt; that I cou=\r\nld not shave for a few weeks. However, the interesting thing is that \n&gt; the=\r\n bursting of a coconut and water getting sprayed maybe uncomfortable and \n&gt;=\r\n painful, BUT invariable it=C2=A0sublimates some major karma that is coming=\r\n. It is \n&gt; NEVER a radom act. I have learnt through experience. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\nd coconut will produce a lot of smoke too. That is another factor to be tak=\r\nen \n&gt; into account. However, all said and done, it is the best offering one=\r\n can make \n&gt; in fire. The effects are simply=C2=A0amazing.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you real=\r\nly want to take your homa experience to the next level, try full \n&gt; coconut=\r\ns. And if you have a firepit dug, then nothing like it...\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sun, 13 March, =\r\n2011 9:04:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Offering whole fresh coconut in h=\r\nomam\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Depending on the materials offered in hom=\r\nam, the effect on one&#39;s subtle \n&gt; consciousness changes. One of the nice su=\r\nbstances that one can offer in \n&gt; homam fire is a whole fresh coconut. Thou=\r\ngh dry coconut (copra) can also \n&gt; be offered, normal fresh whole coconut w=\r\nith water in it is a fantastic \n&gt; material. Traditionally this is what was =\r\noffered as poornaahuti \n&gt; (symbolic of head, i.e. ego).\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, those who=\r\n do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces \n&gt; should ignore this =\r\nmail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in \n&gt; fire is practical onl=\r\ny for those who do homam with a big fire using logs \n&gt; of wood. You want to=\r\n offer something only if you can fully burn it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a fresh coconut is =\r\noffered in fire, it will take a while to burn \n&gt; completely, because it has=\r\n layers (fiber, shell, white stuff and water \n&gt; etc, just like our own ego-=\r\nconsciousness!). If one offers it in the end \n&gt; of homam, it will be a chal=\r\nlenge to make it burn fully.\n&gt; \n&gt; One idea is to offer it in the beginning =\r\ninstead of the end, and give it \n&gt; time to burn, as one goes through homam.=\r\n I, for example, offer a fresh \n&gt; coconut in my daily homam at the end of o=\r\nfferings to Ganapathi at the \n&gt; beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi an=\r\nd offer Chandipath in fire \n&gt; with various offerings. During the course, th=\r\ne fresh coconut burns fully \n&gt; and gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having=\r\n offered a whole fresh \n&gt; coconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell=\r\n you that it is a very \n&gt; good idea (if and only if it is practical in your=\r\n case).\n&gt; \n&gt; One risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can=\r\n gush at \n&gt; you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little unders=\r\ntanding \n&gt; of the dynamics, one should not do this if one is worried about =\r\nthe \n&gt; inhury.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesso=\r\nns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
