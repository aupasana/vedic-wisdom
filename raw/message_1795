Earlier I too felt differently about each mantra a=\r\nnd was curious about it them, always wanting to do the most potent\nand powe=\r\nrful mantra so that the progress speeds up but off late\nI feel differently =\r\nand agree with Narasimha and other to stick to\none and that one mantra will=\r\n do the trick, same with homa also\n\nI did some Lord Ganapati and then here =\r\nand there lord krishna and goddess laxmi devi, lord narasimha dev etc and t=\r\nhen due to winter stopped doing it,\nnow I am gradually starting or thinking=\r\n about them, may be start with\nlord ganapati homa and try to do it atleast =\r\n40 times or so and then\nmay be observe at that time what is in store in the=\r\n mind and also the external circumstances.\n\nFor lord ganpati one mantra tha=\r\nt resonates to me at this time is\n&quot;Om Gam Gluam Ganpataye VighnaVinashine s=\r\nwaha&quot;. Please pardon my spelling errors here. I am sure others feel strongl=\r\ny too about other mantras.\n\nI feel a lot of Lord Ganapati Mantras help remo=\r\nving obstacles, and there may be special mantras for special results or exp=\r\nectations,\nand a lot of people feel strongly about it.\n\nI feel that one can=\r\nnot escape prarabdha karmas, when sanchit karmas take the form of prarabdha=\r\n karmas, sometimes we get good direction and get special mantras and they m=\r\nay help but also at times even trying special mantras one seem to not get a=\r\nny help over prarabdha karma. It is all play of conciousness and unfolding =\r\nor fruitification of karma.\n\nMay be I digressed and moved in different dire=\r\nction, I thought it is important to see different mantras in the light of a=\r\nchiving progress in spiriruality, overcoming obstacles, and our curiocity a=\r\nt times help us get confused and lost.\n\nI do believe one should understand =\r\nabout different mantras and firmly pick quickly with conviction one and use=\r\n that mantra for some period of time without expecting any results or quick=\r\n expectations. Again this applies towards progress in spirituality and not =\r\nfor mantras for worldly expectations. That is a different thing altogether,=\r\n for instance someone wants a child or someone wants to get married or over=\r\ncome some challenges, there are mantras for it and one should consult exper=\r\nts on mantra shastra, and many times the karmas do play their role and to t=\r\nhe extent possible it is better to let it play and be done with it and move=\r\n forward.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinit=\r\na kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranam!\n&gt; \n&gt; As suggested by you i hav=\r\ne switched over to Ganapati mantra. I picked on &quot;om gam ganapataye namah&quot; b=\r\necause it is short and simple. \n&gt; \n&gt; My curiousity has been aroused about t=\r\nhe different &quot;quality&quot; of mantras. The above mantra is supposed to be a &quot;mo=\r\nola&quot; mantra and also a &quot;bija&quot; mantra for ganapati. Can you explain the sign=\r\nificance of this?As a remover of obstacles which other mantra would you sug=\r\ngest for ganapati? i am drawn to &quot;aum vakratundaya hum&quot; also, but do not kn=\r\now how to pronounce the mantra correctly and neither do i know what is the =\r\n&quot;correct&quot; intonation for this. Should i stick to one main mantra only? Toda=\r\ny, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneously towards the end of the hom=\r\nam and i found myself reciting it mentally. Should i resist doing this sinc=\r\ne you have advised that i should do Ganapati mantra at least for a month?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thankyou\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards and best wishes.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
