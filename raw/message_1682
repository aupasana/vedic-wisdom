The entire pr=\r\nathama charitra is \n&gt;   enclosed with Mahakali&#39;s beeja &quot;aim&quot;. The entire ma=\r\ndhyama charitra is \n&gt;   enclosed with Mahalakshmi&#39; s beeja &quot;hreem&quot;. The ent=\r\nire uttara charitra is \n&gt;   enclosed with Mahasaraswati&#39; s beeja &quot;kleem&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   If you want to enclose any mantra with a beeja, the best way is to sa=\r\ny &quot;om \n&gt;   beeja&quot; at the beginning and &quot;beeja om&quot; at the end. For example, =\r\nyou can read \n&gt;   Vishnu sahasra naama stotram or Lakshmi ashtottara sata n=\r\naama stotram with \n&gt;   &quot;om shriim&quot; at the start of &quot;shriim om&quot; at the end o=\r\nf each verse, for \n&gt;   prosperity. You can read Narasimha&#39;s mantra with &quot;om=\r\n kshroum&quot; at the \n&gt;   beginning and &quot;kshroum om&quot; at the end for removal of =\r\npoisons (material and \n&gt;   subtle). You can add &quot;om kliim&quot; and &quot;kliim om&quot; (=\r\nat start/end) to several \n&gt;   mantras, including Gayatri mantra, to overcom=\r\ne desires.\n&gt; \n&gt;   You can note that each chapter in Chandipath is also encl=\r\nosed with plain Om. \n&gt;   You get &quot;om RShiruvaaca&quot; at the beginning and ther=\r\ne is an &quot;om&quot; at the end of \n&gt;   the chapter. Placing plain Om at the beginn=\r\ning and end of a mantra is the \n&gt;   simplest samputikarana. It is used for =\r\nall the 13 chapters.\n&gt; \n&gt;   * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;   When you do Chandipath, it is actu=\r\nally fine to use the 3 beejas (aim, hreem, \n&gt;   kleem) to do samputikarana =\r\nof *each verse* in the respective chapters. For \n&gt;   example, first chapter=\r\n will go as\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;om aim RShiruvaaca aim om\n&gt;   om aim saavaarNiH suurya =\r\ntanayo yo manuH kathyate.aShTamaH\n&gt;   nishaamaya tadutpattim vistaraat gada=\r\nto mam aim om\n&gt;   om aim mahaa maayaanubhaavena yathaa manvantaraadhipaH\n&gt; =\r\n  sa babhuuva mahaabhaagaH saavarNistanayo raveH aim om...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Like thi=\r\ns, add &quot;om aim&quot; at the beginning and &quot;aim om&quot; at the end of each \n&gt;   verse=\r\n in first chapter. For each verse in chapters 2, 3 and 4, add &quot;om \n&gt;   hrii=\r\nm&quot; and &quot;hriim om&quot;. For each verse in other 9 chapters, add &quot;om kliim&quot; \n&gt;   =\r\nand &quot;kliim om&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;   * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;   The beeja aim is known as sristhi beeja=\r\n or creative seed. It puts life in \n&gt;   material and subtle things. Note th=\r\nat Brahma is the rishi for the first part \n&gt;   (pratha charitra).\n&gt; \n&gt;   Th=\r\ne beeja hriim is known as maayaa beeja or delusion seed. It gives mastery \n=\r\n&gt;   over the delusion of this universe and helps one come out of maya. Note=\r\n that \n&gt;   Vishnu is the rishi for the middle part (madhyama charitra).\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   The beeja kliim is known as kaama beeja or desire seed. It helps overco=\r\nme \n&gt;   desires and cleanse one. Note that Rudra is the rishi for the final=\r\n part \n&gt;   (uttara charitra).\n&gt; \n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt;   Narasimha\n&gt;   ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;   Do a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;   Do Pitri Tarpanas Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;   Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;   Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;   Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;   Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagannath.org\n&gt;   ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- - \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;=\r\nvedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent:=\r\n Thursday, April 02, 2009 1:14 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: a questio=\r\nn on Chandi Paath (Durga Saptashati)\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Yes Prasad Bhai,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; =\r\nas you mentioned, it is a samputa and there are many instances where this \n=\r\n&gt;   &gt; concept is used. let us see if we can get opinion of some members hav=\r\ning \n&gt;   &gt; knowledge of this.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Utpal\n&gt;=\r\n   &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;&gt; Namaste Utpal ji,\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;&gt; This is called &#39;samputam&#39; (Lit.=\r\n meaning a covered box or enclosing \n&gt;   &gt;&gt; with folded palms as in anjali)=\r\n.
