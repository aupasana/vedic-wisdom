But he would not listen to them or the\ndevote=\r\nes who appealed to him to follow the advice. Some of them were\nearnestly be=\r\ngging him to eat thickly-buttered bread, others were trying to\nmake him dri=\r\nnk milk and orange juice. But to all of them he had only one\nanswer to give=\r\n. With his usual genial smile he would say, &quot;But how can we\nafford to have =\r\nsuch a luxurious diet? For us there can only be the poor\nman&#39;s rations.&quot;\n\n&quot;=\r\nBut what is the harm in changing one&#39;s diet for the sake of one&#39;s health?&quot;\n=\r\nventured one devotee in a plaintive tone. &quot;Even Mahatma Gandhi takes a\nspec=\r\nial diet and Sri Aurobindo too does the same, to keep up their health.\nPlea=\r\nse, therefore, take a tumblerful of orange juice, at least for our\nsake.&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;But do you know the cost of a tumbler of orange juice?&quot; asked Sri Bhagavan=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Oh, only four annas,&quot; rejoined the devotee, with hope gleaming in his e=\r\nyes.\n\n&quot;No, It won&#39;t be four annas. We will require about 200 tumblers of ju=\r\nice. Do\nyou want me alone to gulp down the drink with all of you watching,\n=\r\nempty-handed ? Moreover, how can poor people like us provide for 200\ntumble=\r\nrs of juice, costing fifty rupees daily?&quot;\n\nThis answer checked the devotee&#39;=\r\ns pleas for a while, but he would not give\nup so easily. He still had a lin=\r\ngering hope that if once Sri Bhagavan\nstarted to take the nourishing diet, =\r\nhe would continue to do so for at least\nenough days for his health to impro=\r\nve a little. So, the next day, he quietly\nprepared hot rotis well smeared w=\r\nith ghee, and filled two tumblers, one with\nmilk and the other with orange =\r\njuice. Then, with the assistance of a few\nother devotees, he took all these=\r\n things to Sri Bhagavan on a tray.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s all this?&quot; he inquired as he sa=\r\nw them walking towards him. The\ndevotees placed the tray before him, uncove=\r\nred it and begged him to accept\nthe offering. He refused point-blank even t=\r\no touch the food, asking instead\nthat the devotees should consume it. Repea=\r\nted appeals to him from other\ndevotees were also of no avail.\n\nThen, in the=\r\n heat of the moment, a woman devotee who was present at the time\nburst out,=\r\n &quot;O Bhagavan! Just as you are kind enough to agree to sit on your\nsofa - in=\r\nstead of on the floor like everyone else - for our sake, why not\nalso favor=\r\n us by taking this special diet?&quot; Though the woman spoke these\nwords in goo=\r\nd faith, the outcome was quite the reverse of what was expected.\n\nHardly ha=\r\nd she finished when, to her and the other devotees&#39; dismay, Sri\nBhagavan go=\r\nt down from his sofa and squatted on the floor. The woman was\nhorrified by =\r\nthe consequences of her suggestion. She called out with anguish\nin her hear=\r\nt and tears in her eyes, &quot;Bhagavan! No! Please don&#39;t! What a\nstupid woman I=\r\n am!&quot; Then she got hysterical and started screaming.\n\nAll the others stood =\r\naround, aghast at what had happened. The remedy had\nturned out to be worse =\r\nthan the disease. The rotis, the milk, the juice were\nabandoned as everybod=\r\ny racked their brains to find a way out of this impasse\nand reseat Sri Bhag=\r\navan on the sofa.\n\nIt was certain that no appeal or argument would move Sri=\r\n Bhagavan to change\nhis decision. Eventually a devotee who had been associa=\r\nted with Sri Bhagavan\nfor over thirty-five years resolved to take a despera=\r\nte step. Without any\nfuss, he simply started lifting Sri Bhagavan bodily. S=\r\neeing this, one or two\nother devotees joined him and together they succeede=\r\nd in placing Sri\nBhagavan&#39;s body back on the sofa. Sri Bhagavan did not res=\r\nist, nor\nsubsequently did he try to come down from the sofa. But the devote=\r\nes had\nbeen so upset by the incident that even after seeing Sri Bhagavan si=\r\ntting\nquietly on the sofa again, they began to beseech him not to get down =\r\nagain.\n\nSri Bhagavan accepted the new situation graciously. Thus, a loving =\r\nattempt\nby devotees to make Sri Bhagavan agree to take a special diet came =\r\nto a\nfruitless end.\n\nThough he would usually get annoyed if devotees tried =\r\nto give him special\ntreatment, or if he saw people needlessly inflicting su=\r\nffering on others, Sri\nBhagavan could never be provoked to anger by anyamou=\r\nnt of criticism or\npersonal abuse. Two separate incidents illustrate this v=\r\nery well.\n\nOnce when Sri Bhagavan was sitting in his cave on Arunachala, a =\r\nsadhu who\nwas jealous of his increasing fame urinated on his back as a deli=\r\nberate act\nof provocation. Sri Bhagavan remained as unperturbed and Self-ab=\r\nsorbed as\never. Not a tinge of anger rose in him. The sadhu was baffled by =\r\nhis calm\nresponse. Realizing that nothing could irritate Sri Bhagavan, the =\r\npoor sadhu\nquietly went away.\n\nOn another occasion, many years later, a you=\r\nng man visited Sri Ramanasramam\nwith an evil purpose. After entering the ha=\r\nll and taking his seat in the\nfront row, he began to put all kinds of aggre=\r\nssive questions to Sri\nBhagavan. We found out later that he wanted to extor=\r\nt hush-money from the\nashram by trying to expose Sri Bhagavan as a hypocrit=\r\ne and a fraud. He had\nalready successfully tried his trick elsewhere, and b=\r\ny repeated practice he\nhad cultivated this art into a paying profession. Ha=\r\nving gained successes in\nother ashrams, he had come to Sri Ramanasramam to =\r\ntry his tricks there.\n\nSri Bhagavan&#39;s own method of meeting insolence, mali=\r\nce, jealousy and\nmisbehavior in general was the observance of complete sile=\r\nnce. This powerful\nweapon baffled and disarmed all aggressive and insolent =\r\nvisitors.\n\nWhen the youth tried to draw Sri Bhagavan into a controversial d=\r\niscussion so\nhe could catch him when he made a potentially embarrassing ans=\r\nwer, Sri\nBhagavan remained completely silent. The poor man could make no he=\r\nadway at\nall. He tried insults, he tried belching out foul language, but Sr=\r\ni Bhagavan\ndid not utter a single word. He did not accept any of the insult=\r\ns or respond\nto them in any way. He merely remained calm, unperturbed and s=\r\nmiling. The\nyoung man, after exhausting all his insults, saw the impossibil=\r\nity of\nachieving his object. He had to admit defeat and quit the ashram.\n\nS=\r\nource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1994/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e68deb060586af04882f1203\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;ONCE when Sri Bhagavan was very=\r\n debilitated, the doctors recommended that he take some nourishing food.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;=C2=A0But he would not listen to them or the devotees who appealed to h=\r\nim to follow the advice.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Some of them=\r\n were earnestly begging him to eat thickly-buttered bread, others were tryi=\r\nng to make him drink milk and orange juice.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;But to all of them =\r\nhe had only one answer to give.
