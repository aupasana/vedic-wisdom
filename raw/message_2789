It is used to predict the solar/lunar eclipses and distance and locati=\r\non=C2=A0of other planets from earth. He entered the relevant details about =\r\nthe planetary\npositions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki and obtained very int=\r\neresting and=C2=A0convincing results, which almost determine the important =\r\ndates starting from the birth=C2=A0of Shri Ram to the date of his coming ba=\r\nck to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.\n\nMaharishi Valmiki has recorded in B=\r\nal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka eight and nine=C2=A0(1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram w=\r\nas born on ninth tithi of Chaitra month when the=C2=A0position of different=\r\n planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations and nakshatras\n(visible stars) wer=\r\ne: =C2=A0\na) Sun in Aries; =C2=A0b) Saturn in Libra; =C2=A0c) Jupiter in Ca=\r\nncer; =C2=A0\nd) Venus in Pisces; =C2=A0e) Mars in Capricorn; f) Lunar month=\r\n of Chaitra; =C2=A0g) Ninth day after no moon; =C2=A0h) Lagna as Cancer (ca=\r\nncer was rising in the=C2=A0east); =C2=A0i) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini c=\r\nonstellation & Pllux star);=C2=A0j) Day time (around noon).\n=C2=A0\nThis dat=\r\na was fed into the software. The=C2=A0results indicated that this was exact=\r\nly the location of planets/stars in=C2=A0the noon of January 10, 5114 BC. T=\r\nhus Shri Ram was born on January 10,=C2=A05114 BC (7123 years back).=C2=A0\n=\r\n\nAs per the Indian calendar it was the ninth day=C2=A0of Shukla Paksha in C=\r\nhaitra month and the time was around 12 to 1 noon time.=C2=A0This is exactl=\r\ny the time and date when Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.\n\nShri Ram =\r\nwas born in Ayodhya.=C2=A0\n\nThis fact can be ascertained from several=C2=A0=\r\nbooks written by Indian and foreign authors before and after the=C2=A0birth=\r\n of Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasas&#39; Raghuvansam,\nBaudh =\r\nand Jain literature, etc.=C2=A0\n\nThese books have narrated in great detail=\r\n=C2=A0the location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had many=\r\n=C2=A0palaces and temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located o=\r\nn=C2=A0the banks of the Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one=\r\n=C2=A0side and Mithila on the other side.=C2=A0\n\nNormally 7,000 years is a =\r\nvery long period=C2=A0during which earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign =\r\ninvasions change the\ncourse of rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alte=\r\nr the territories. \n\nTherefore, the task of unearthing the facts is monumen=\r\ntal. The present=C2=A0Ayodhya has shrunk in size and the rivers have change=\r\nd their course=C2=A0about 40 km north/south. Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya i=\r\nn his=C2=A0childhood (13th year as per Valmiki Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwami=\r\ntra=C2=A0who lived in Tapovan (Sidhhashram).=C2=A0\n\nFrom there he went to M=\r\nithila, King=C2=A0Janakas&#39; kingdom. Here he married Sita after breaking Shi=\r\nv Dhanusha (bow).\n\nResearchers have gone along the route adopted by Shri Ra=\r\nm as narrated=C2=A0in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places which have me=\r\nmorials that=C2=A0commemorate the events related to the life of Shri Ram. T=\r\nhese include=C2=A0Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, Gautamas=\r\nhram,=C2=A0Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc.=C2=A0\n\nMemorials are bu=\r\nilt for great=C2=A0men and not for fictitious characters.\n\nDate of exile of=\r\n Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayans&#39;=C2=A0Ayodhya Kand (2/4/18) =\r\nthat Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the=C2=A0king because Sun, Mars and =\r\nRahu had surrounded his nakshatra and=C2=A0normally under such planetary co=\r\nnfiguration the king dies or becomes=C2=A0a victim of conspiracies.=C2=A0\n\n=\r\nDashratha&#39;s zodiac sign was Pisces and his=C2=A0nakshatra was Rewati. This =\r\nplanetary configuration was prevailing on=C2=A0the January 5, 5089 BC, and =\r\nit was on this day that Shri Ram left\nAyodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, =\r\nhe was 25 years old at that=C2=A0time (5114-5089). There are several shloka=\r\ns in Valmiki Ramayan=C2=A0which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old whe=\r\nn he left=C2=A0Ayodhya for exile.=C2=A0\n\nValmiki Ramayan refers to the sola=\r\nr eclipse at=C2=A0the time of war with Khardushan in later half of 13th yea=\r\nr of Shri=C2=A0Rams&#39; exile.. It is also mentioned it was amavasya day and M=\r\nars was\n=C2=A0in the middle ... When this data was entered, the software in=\r\ndicated=C2=A0that there was a solar eclipse on October 7, 5077 BC,\n(amavasy=\r\na day) which could be seen from Panchvati.=C2=A0\n\nThe planetary=C2=A0config=\r\nuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one=C2=A0side were V=\r\nenus and Mercury and on the other side were=C2=A0Sun and Saturn.=C2=A0\n\nOn =\r\nthe basis of planetary configurations described=C2=A0in various other chapt=\r\ners, the date on which Ravana was killed works=C2=A0out to be December 4, 5=\r\n076 BC, and Shri Ram completed 14 years of=C2=A0exile on January 2, 5075 BC=\r\n, and that day was also Navami of Shukla=C2=A0Paksha in Chaitra month.=C2=\r\n=A0\n\nThus Shri Ram had come back to Ayodhya=C2=A0at the age of 39 (5114-507=\r\n5).=C2=A0\n\nA colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched=C2=A0on places visited by =\r\nShri Ram during his exile, and sequentially moved=C2=A0to the places stated=\r\n as visited by Shri Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan;=C2=A0starting from Ayodhya =\r\nhe went right upto Rameshwaram. He found 195=C2=A0places which still have t=\r\nhe memorials connected to the events narrated in=C2=A0the Ramayana relating=\r\n to the life of Shri Ram and Sita. These include=C2=A0Tamsa Tal (Mandah), S=\r\nhringverpur (Singraur), Bhardwaj Ashram=C2=A0(situated near Allahabad), Atr=\r\ni Ashram, Markandaya Ashram (Markundi),\nChitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of G=\r\nodavari), Panchvati, Sita Sarovar,=C2=A0Ram Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nas=\r\nik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha=C2=A0(village Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Ra=\r\nmeshwar temple.\n\nIn Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram&#39;s army co=\r\nnstructed a=C2=A0bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After c=\r\nrossing=C2=A0this bridge, Shri Rams&#39; army had defeated Ravana.=C2=A0\n\nRecen=\r\ntly, NASA=C2=A0put pictures on the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins=\r\n of which=C2=A0are lying submerged in Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and S=\r\nri Lanka.\n\nRecently the Sri Lankan Government had expressed the desire to=\r\n=C2=A0develop Sita Vatika as a tourist spot. Sri Lankans believe this was=\r\n=C2=A0Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).\n\n=\r\nIndian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the Suryavansh=C2=A0a=\r\nnd he was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant=C2=\r\n=A0particulars of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written=\r\n=C2=A0about 80 years ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram.=C2=A0\n\nProfessor Subhash =\r\nKak=C2=A0of Lousiana University, in his book, The Astronomical Code of the =\r\nRig=C2=A0Veda, has also listed 63 ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayod=\r\nhya.\n\nSri Rams&#39; ancestors have been traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha=\r\n,=C2=A0King Aja, King Raghu, King Dilip and so on. From Kashmir to=C2=A0Kan=\r\nyakumari and from Bengal to Gujarat, everywhere people believe=C2=A0in the =\r\nreality of Shri Rams&#39; existence, particularly in the tribal=C2=A0areas of H=\r\nimaachal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and the North-East.\n\nMost of the festiv=\r\nals celebrated in these areas revolve around the=C2=A0events in the life of=\r\n Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.=C2=A0The events and places related to the life =\r\nof Shri Ram and Sita are true\ncultural and social heritage of every Indian =\r\nirrespective of caste and=C2=A0creed. Therefore, it is common heritage.=C2=\r\n=A0\n\nAfter all, Shri Ram belonged=C2=A0to the period when Prophet Mohammed =\r\nor Jesus Christ were not born=C2=A0and Muslim or Christian faiths were unkn=\r\nown to the world.\n\nThe words Hindu (resident of Hindustan) and Indian (resi=\r\ndent of India)=C2=A0were synonymous. India was also known as Bharat (land o=\r\nf knowledge)=C2=A0and Aryavarta (where Aryans live) and Hindustan=C2=A0(lan=\r\nd of &quot;Hindus&quot; - derived from word Indus).\n\nDuring Ram Rajya (rule), the evi=\r\nls of caste system based on birth were=C2=A0non-existent.=C2=A0\n\nIn fact, M=\r\naharishi Valmiki is stated to be of shudra class\n(scheduled caste), still S=\r\nita lived with him as his adopted daughter after=C2=A0she was banished from=\r\n Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram as=C2=A0his disciples..=C2=A0\n\nWe=\r\n need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was perhaps\nthe first great astr=\r\nonomer and that his study of planetary configurations=C2=A0has stood the te=\r\nst of times.=C2=A0\n\nEven the latest computer softwares have=C2=A0corroborat=\r\ned his astronomical calculations, which proves that he did not\ncommit any e=\r\nrror. Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe..\n\nShri Ram&#39;s ar=\r\nmy, which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by=C2=A0various tribals=\r\n from Central and South India.=C2=A0\n\nThe facts, events and=C2=A0all other =\r\ndetails relating to the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage=C2=A0of al=\r\nl the Indians including scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims,=C2=A0C=\r\nhristians, etc.\n\nProphet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ wa=\r\ns born 2,000 years back. Gautam Buddha was born=C2=A02,600 years back, wher=\r\neas Ram was born 7,000 years ago.=C2=A0\n\nHence,=C2=A0discovering the detail=\r\ns relating to Shri Rams&#39; life would be lot more=C2=A0difficult as destructi=\r\non caused by floods, earthquakes and invasions etc.,=C2=A0would be far grea=\r\nter. But, should that stop our quest for learning more=C2=A0about our cultu=\r\nral heritage?\n\nAs Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the India=\r\nn civilization=C2=A0is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly=\r\n more than=C2=A010,000 years old.
