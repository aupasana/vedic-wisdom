If they are not accomp=\r\nanied by internal transformation, they are useless.\n \nPeople are always eag=\r\ner to get something easily. They think that they can get a lot of good by v=\r\nisiting a specific place or doing a particular ritual or saying a particula=\r\nr mantra or wearing vibhuti or sandalwood powder from a particular temple o=\r\nr a particular ritual etc. Unfortunately, the truth is that it is not that =\r\nsimple to burn karmas and get good results. Without internal transformation=\r\n, external things are meaningless.\n \nA kid who wants to drive a car may be =\r\ngiven a toy car by parents. The kid may play with it and practice with it. =\r\nIf one uses the toy car correctly to practice and develop driving skills, i=\r\nt will be useful when one gets a real car. If one does not develop any skil=\r\nls and keeps feeling proud of what a nice toy car one has, it does not help=\r\n one with the real car. One&#39;s skills do not develop. The toy is meant for c=\r\nreating skill with the real.\n \nSimilarly, doing rituals and pilgrimages is =\r\nmeant for visualizing god, surrendering to god, overcoming pride and self-i=\r\nmportance, get the mind of impermanent things and focus on the permanent (i=\r\n.e. god). If one&#39;s self-important attitude remains and devotion and humilit=\r\ny do not develop, one&#39;s rituals and pilgrimages do not serve much purpose.\n=\r\n \nThis reminds me of a small incident.\n \nPoornaahuti in a homam is supposed=\r\n to symbolize offering the head (ego!) to the deity and surrender completel=\r\ny (and think &quot;you are the doer and I am just an instrument&quot;). The gentleman=\r\n conducting a grand homam I went to (he is the head of a religious order in=\r\n India) talked for a few minutes on how they collected various auspicious m=\r\naterials for the poornaahuti, how their poornaahuti is so rare and great an=\r\nd how we are all so lucky to witness the poornaahuti offering of such a mat=\r\nchless homam. Such pride and focus on the irrelevant is useless. One is bet=\r\nter off offering a simple coconut with complete surrender than offering so =\r\nmany auspicious materials with such pride.\n \nAs Ramakrishna says, one who e=\r\nngages in great rituals, pilgrimages and other austerities recommended by s=\r\ncriptures, with the mind still focused on *impermanent* things like money, =\r\nsensual pleasures, name, fame etc, is not making progress. Goal of sadhana =\r\nis to get some control over the mind, take it off impermanent things that i=\r\nt is naturally attracted to and focus it on the imperishable Self (or god).=\r\n\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n=\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lesso=\r\nns (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJa=\r\ngannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--- \n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasan=\r\nth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ramakrishna (smiling): Well, I went to some places.
