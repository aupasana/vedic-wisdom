Once, Vishnu went from Vaikuntha to Brahmaloka=\r\n. Everyone\n&gt; in Brahmaloka, led by Brahma himself, got up to receive Vishnu=\r\n. Sanatkumara\n&gt; alone remained seated. Vishnu told him, &quot;You remain still b=\r\necause you think\n&gt; you are beyond desire, though this is rooted in ego, and=\r\n you are still\n&gt; afflicted by desire. Since you have yet to overcome desire=\r\n, you will\n&gt; still undergo another birth.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When this applies to Sanatk=\r\numara, who are we to think that we are beyond\n&gt; impurities and karma-yoga?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; \n&gt;    ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Mar 8, 2013 at 9:56 AM, s=\r\nunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some food for thought.
