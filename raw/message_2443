How ever, over the next few days, the wind was blow=\r\ning heavily and I could not keep the fire on for more than few seconds.\n\nFo=\r\nol of me, I got upset and was cursing the air god. How ever, with some pers=\r\nistant, I got better. Here are my learnings:\n\n1. Initially, while praying t=\r\no Ganesh before you start the fire, request him to avoid any blockings\n\n2. =\r\nKeep 3 dry coconus pieces instead of 2.\n\n3. Put a slightly bigger piece of =\r\ncamphor, and surrouse it with 2 pieces of dry coconus (put vertically and n=\r\not flat). This way, they block the air flow onto camphor.\n\n4. Leave a small=\r\n gap on to your side, and ensure that the third peice is not wide and inser=\r\nt into this gap. If this peice is wider, you will have to leave more gap an=\r\nd air will blow easily through the gap.\n\n5. Fire the camphor and be prepare=\r\nd to use your palms to block any air putting the fire off. Initially, there=\r\n will be heavy smoke as the inside portion of verticle peices (which is whi=\r\nte) will burn. Sooner, the outer side of the peices will catch fire and the=\r\nn you can relax and remove your hands.\n\n6. Keep few more pieces of coconus =\r\npeices ready. Also have ghee ready for liveral use. Beyond this, even a str=\r\nong wind is likely to spare the fire.\n\n7. Even after this if the fire goes =\r\noff, don&#39;t get upset. It is not a bad omen and simply start the fire again =\r\nand continue from where you were. Feeling urge to start all over again will=\r\n eventually get you frustated.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n\n"}}
