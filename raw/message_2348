The age of eight has been prescribed  for Upanayana Samskara. The word,Upanayana  means &quot;taking or leading of the student near or to the Guru.&quot;  It is also called as  the ceremony of Brahmopadesam--taking the young student near  Brahman, that is to say, introducing him to Brahmajignasa, the path of Brahma.  Upanayanam  is the initiation  of a boy into  Brahmacharya Asrama  and is a prelude to bachelorhood.  It is one of the Samskaras or rites which reconstruct the personality,reform the mind, purify it and re-build it.  It makes the person receiving it a Dwija, atwice-born. The boy is  physically born first into the world; now,he is born into the Sadhaka world.  He becomes a Brahmachari, a person  who moves towards Brahman. Thus it is a very significant day in the lives of the boys, a day they must\n long remember with joy and thankfulness.  The initiation is done with the Upadesam  of the GAYATRI MANTRAM which is a  prayer that calls upon the glorious power that pervades the Sun and thre worlds to arouse, awaken and strengthen the intelligence,so that it may lead to intense  Sadhana.  The  Brahmachari vows  himself into a life of Sadhana. In the case of students of Krishna Yajurveda,  there are four vratas  between purvanga  called Upanayana  and uttaranga  called samavartana,  which is celebrated when the student comes back home from Gurukulam after completing the discipline of Brahmacharya  and study of Vedas  and is eligible for entering into household life. These four vratas  are prajapatya,saumya,agneya and  vaisvadeva. For Rig-veda  it is different. Each Veda  has its own vratas.\n\nA student is required to observe strictly the rules of Brahmacharya  if he were to master  the mantras. Here lies the importance of the  Upanayana ceremonies.  \n(to be continued)\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-519190536-1251339476=:2051\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:18pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Friends,&lt;br&gt;When a boy is old enough to chant mantras and understand the significance of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Vihita karma anushtana&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;, &nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;the Upanayana of a boy is required to be performed.
