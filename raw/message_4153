These are Prana, Udana, samana, vyana, apana.=\r\n Out of these &#39;Prana vaayu&#39; helps in respiration. \n\n3) The air flowing in a=\r\nnd out of lungs during the process of repiration (Inhalation and exhalation=\r\n) is also called Prana vaayu. As this air is essential for life maintainanc=\r\ne\n\n4) Cool, clean and dustfree air which flows in morning. This is dustfree=\r\n, pollution free and is moist. Due to this, this is considered good for hea=\r\nlth. \n\nPrana:\n\n1) Life\n\n2) Some times it is also used for Prana-shakti. The=\r\n Physical and mental energy stored in our body. A type of this is termed as=\r\n spiritual energy.\n\n3) The Inhalation and exhalation process. \n\nIt is advis=\r\ned to wakeup in Brahmmuhurta ( roughly around 4:30 am, or about 30-45 minut=\r\nes before sunrise) Because of following reasons\n\n1) This time is believed t=\r\no be ruled by Devatas. So one gets the blessings of devatas in this time.\n\n=\r\n2) This time is believed to have saatvik energy. This purifies the mind.\n\n3=\r\n) This time air is dust free, clean and without pollution. This purifies th=\r\ne body.\n\n4) During this time All the doshas (Vaata-pitta and kapha) are in =\r\nbalanced proportion. So our body is healthy and free from diseases. Waking =\r\ntoo late will increase kapha in body and waking too early will increase vaa=\r\nta in body. very common problems like constipation, insomnia, depression, l=\r\naziness, low immunity, cold can be avoided and infact cured just by waking =\r\nup in this time\n\nfurther, During this time, the concentration of Oxygen is =\r\nnot so High that it will cause oxidation. For oxidation of cells, much high=\r\ner concentration is needed. \n\nAnd, the concentration of CO2 and O2 never fl=\r\nuctuate too much so that we have to worry about their concentration until a=\r\nnd unless the difference is more than 10% in case of CO2 and 20% in case of=\r\n O2. (These are approx figures). With in this range we will not even notice=\r\n any difference in our surroundings or any type of discomfort.\n\nI hope it h=\r\nelps.\n\nSorry for mistakes. \nRegards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; During throught=\r\n the day if you notice breath flows through one nostril alternating every o=\r\nne and a half hour i.e. right nostril one and half hour then left nostril t=\r\nhen after one and a half right so on.\n&gt; But it is said during brahmamuhurta=\r\n(time between night and day) and sayanha(time between day and night) breath=\r\n flows through both the nostrils.\n&gt; This yoga of breath or prana is extensi=\r\nvely dealt in Swara-yoga.\n&gt; A brief outline of what it is given here.I coul=\r\nd not confirm its authenticity though it will give an idea of what Swara-yo=\r\nga is \n&gt; http://www.premnirmal.com/swara-yoga/the-almighty-breath.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, MUKESH SONI &lt;mukesh_csp@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pranaam!\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Curiosity ##1:\n&gt; &gt; How more =E2=80=98Pran-Vay=\r\nu=E2=80=99 blows in =E2=80=98brama-moohrat=E2=80=99 ???\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I kn=\r\new some facts through reading books that- \n&gt; &gt; #:=C2=A0 More =E2=80=9CPran-=\r\nVayu=E2=80=9D blows in =E2=80=98brama-moohrat=E2=80=99 environment. \n&gt; &gt; #:=\r\n=C2=A0 =E2=80=9Cgetup early=E2=80=9D has more beneficial to Mind body and s=\r\noul. \n&gt; &gt; #:=C2=A0 =E2=80=9Cbrama-moohrat=E2=80=9D period is known before 2=\r\n hours of sun-rise. \n&gt; &gt; #: =E2=80=9CPranvayu=E2=80=9D means Oxygen.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I also read - \n&gt; &gt; #: Oxygen is produce through =E2=80=9Cphoto-s=\r\nynthesis=E2=80=9D in presence of sun. \n&gt; &gt; #: Production of oxygen done by =\r\nTrees in day time only. \n&gt; &gt; #: More =E2=80=9CCarbon-dioxide=E2=80=9D is pr=\r\noduce in night by trees. \n&gt; &gt; #: Less oxygen! less efficiency !!! \n&gt; &gt; #: L=\r\ness =E2=80=9Coxygen=E2=80=9D in night, more =E2=80=9Ccarbon-dioxide=E2=80=\r\n=9D in night.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Because=C2=A0 there is no presence of =\r\nsun !!! \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; So, how more =E2=80=98Pran Vayu=E2=80=99 !!! blows =\r\nin =E2=80=98brama-moohrat=E2=80=99 ??? \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I am seeking answer,=\r\n if anyone has information, please share with us.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Yours \n&gt; &gt; Mukesh Soni \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       The INTERNET now has=\r\n a personality.
