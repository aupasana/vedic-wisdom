Whil=\r\ne giving aahuties i mainly give til ahutii, but for fire management issue \n=\r\ncan i offer ghee/coconut pieces as ahuti in between or simply just like tha=\r\nt with swaha\n\n3. After poorahuti and one drop of ghee to fire, can we add m=\r\nore ghee later if there is smoke.\n\nregards\nAkshaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
