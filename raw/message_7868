Lets look =\r\nat few\n&gt; probable scenarios:\n&gt; \n&gt;  1. *Scenario 1*: U helped cow to pay bac=\r\nk its Rna. Possible that only way\n&gt; for cow to get rid of it&#39;s past births =\r\nRna was to be eaten by you, someone\n&gt; who revered it. Maybe, you helped it =\r\ntremendously.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. *Scenario 2*: In some medical conditions, Ayurveda re=\r\ncommends meat\n&gt; eating (Red meat). Perhaps, Nature/God/Deity wanted to help=\r\n your body and\n&gt; created this situation as voluntarily you would never had =\r\neaten it. Then\n&gt; instead of guilty, you should be thankful to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nhypothetical scenarios above show that happening is a happening and we\n&gt; sh=\r\nould neither have a guilt or should Gloat over it. Now, I will describe a\n&gt;=\r\n real scenario.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a discussion with a *Guru* about food and if Saa=\r\ntvik food is best.\n&gt; His viewpoint was that excess of Satva is not right. A=\r\nccording to him, It\n&gt; should be a balance between all three Gunas. Specific=\r\nally about me, he\n&gt; mentioned a lack of Rajas. He infact suggested me to st=\r\nart eating Non-veg\n&gt; (Fish and Egg white). I could not implement his sugges=\r\ntion as I simply\n&gt; can&#39;t. But, I wanted to share it to make a point that sp=\r\nirituality linked\n&gt; to Vegetarianism is a Limited way of thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reg=\r\nards\n&gt; Puneet\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 4:01 PM, Vasavi &lt;vasavi_rani@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks everyone for advises. Puneet ji, it is so unfortunat=\r\ne for me to\n&gt; &gt; have something like this happened and the reason being, as =\r\nyou mentioned ,\n&gt; &gt; I took every care while placing the order and told them=\r\n to not mix up beans\n&gt; &gt; with beef, change the gloves and wash the hands. S=\r\no despite me giving them\n&gt; &gt; clear instructions, they messed it up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n This what I do every time I order. There are several reasons for my pain,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; besides being a vegetaria, I am also against animal slaughter and cow i=\r\ns an\n&gt; &gt; animal I revere most.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As you said, I need to ask god to no=\r\nt put me in such a situation. But I am\n&gt; &gt; not sure if he will hear me.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Vasavi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent from my iPad\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
