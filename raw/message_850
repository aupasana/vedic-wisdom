You can break each \nc=\r\noconut Half with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.\n\n2) A very sma=\r\nll bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is \nsufficient as &#39;Ghee Aah=\r\nutis&#39; are to be given as only a single drop \nwhenever it is mentioned in th=\r\ne Manual.\n\n3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically not mentioned, one can off=\r\ner \nAaahutis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya \net=\r\nc... Now one can choose each of the above stuffs one by one for \noffering a=\r\ns aahuti or can use single stuff.\n\nto elaborate, at each Swaha, one can tak=\r\ne One Kishmis or Few Mamara \nor one almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya =\r\nand offer to Agni.\n\nIf you have Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of=\r\n some stuff \nwhich can be offer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offer=\r\ned as \nAahuti same as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take \nv=\r\nery little &#39;Havan samgri powder and offer it.\n\nThus one person can easily p=\r\nerform homam as explained above because \nfirstly, one doesn&#39;t need to give =\r\nAahutis of Ghee and other stuff \nsimultaneously. secondly, Counting of any =\r\nmantra can be done with \nleft fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.=\r\n\n\n2 kg of Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms \nwill be=\r\n sufficient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..\n\n4) The Homa Fir=\r\ne represents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. \nhence it is suggested th=\r\nat Aahutis are only offered by You alone \nwhile mother and others can sit b=\r\neside you and concentrate. they \nwill gain lot of spiritual benefit just by=\r\n attending.\n\n5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that copper one=\r\n can \nalso be used.\n\n6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who of=\r\nfer ghee \naahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i think i&#39;ve also s=\r\neen \nthat during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatri. I suppose it \na=\r\nlso must be one of the right ways. however i have complete faith in \nwhat N=\r\narasimha has given in Manual and that also must be the other \nright way of =\r\nmany ways. although you can choose between the above \ntwo, i recommend to g=\r\no as per the Manual if you are going to do as \nper the manual given by him.=\r\n\n\nLastly, i would suggest not to bother yourself with much \ntechnicalities =\r\nand burden of perfection. in the first few runs, \nthere are many things dur=\r\ning Havan which can go imperefct. do as per \nmanual and enjoy you Homam wit=\r\nh your mother & others and offcourse \nwith the mother of universe !!!\n\nI ho=\r\npe, i gave you the answers - Beautifully.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n&lt;khosladheeraj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n&gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   =\r\n            I want to do homam for chandi \ndevi.I \n&gt; &gt; had arranged a coppe=\r\nr tray in square shape.Almost 1 feet by 1 \n&gt; feet. \n&gt; &gt; So is it good measu=\r\nrement or not ? I also bought havan samagri, \n&gt; dry \n&gt; &gt; coconuts etc.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;                     Actually i want to start with short cut \nmethod \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; so please advice me that ,how much ghee,havan samagri, dry \ncoconut \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n etc are used in one havana, so that i will plan these items \n&gt; &gt; according=\r\nly.I have arranged 2 kg of havan samagri, 1 kg dry \n&gt; coconuts \n&gt; &gt; etc..So=\r\n how to divide this in ratio as per single day \nprocess.How \n&gt; &gt; much ghee =\r\nin grams per havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf \nnotes \n&gt; &gt; on homam aga=\r\nin and again but doing practical things r difficult \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; need much m=\r\nore focus and methodology.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                Although  by God grace a=\r\nnd your encouragement to \n&gt; &gt; people for doing homams, even i myself get tr=\r\nansformed towards \n&gt; &gt; homam ,so thanks for that. But i need your step by s=\r\ntep guidance \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; everything is  not included in your notes( although=\r\n its best \nnotes \n&gt; &gt; on homam). Its my weakness actually.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n             In normal homams by priests in India ,they do \nswaha \n&gt; &gt; with=\r\n ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after they \n&gt; pour \n&gt; &gt; gh=\r\nee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of \nghee \n&gt; &gt; in w=\r\nater too. So is it correct way or not ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                \n&gt; &gt;       =\r\n         If single person is doing a homam then how to \n&gt; manage \n&gt; &gt; ahuti=\r\ns of ghee and samagri both and of course mantra mala or \nnotes \n&gt; u \n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\novided ? Bcz in India, normally full group or family do homams \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\npriest only says mantras.So i think two people r must for homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n              I have spoon made of wood ,Is it ok or i have to \n&gt; buy \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nof copper metal ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                 I am still unmarried so can i do=\r\n with my mother \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; chandi homam ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;              \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n   Please provide me some beautiful answers of these \n&gt; queries.And \n&gt; &gt; do=\r\nnt mind if my queries prove to be very simple and \nillogical.But \n&gt; i \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhave to start from basics .So just cooperate with me as i love \nthe \n&gt; &gt; wo=\r\nrk with perfection.In next mail i will ask some queries on \n&gt; mantras \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nin order to understand properly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; U r really spreading vedic wisdom=\r\n in true practical sense.
