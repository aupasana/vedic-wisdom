However, there is one mor=\r\ne angle to consider.\n\nManish told me long back that we should guard against=\r\n focusing on &quot;personalities&quot; and building awe. He said we should focus on s=\r\nadhana. He said, &quot;my message is not that I am special, but it is that every=\r\none is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyo=\r\nne can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anyb=\r\nody could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, th=\r\nere will be many people who make great progress. World will be a changed pl=\r\nace.&quot;\n\nManish said, &quot;people should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you ar=\r\ne on earth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do=\r\n whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japa=\r\nm. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana=\r\n or the other for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, b=\r\nut keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nI have personally =\r\nseen clear indications that Manish operates on a different plane compared t=\r\no most people. I will give a few small examples in this writeup. However, I=\r\n want to re-iterate that Manish does not see himself as a special person or=\r\n a &quot;man of god&quot; as you say, but sees himself as a small instrument of Natur=\r\ne.\n\nWhen I mention any supernatural things involving Manish, the goal is to=\r\n show that such things are possible even now and not just limited to books =\r\nand stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we &quot;educated city people&quot; lack faith.=\r\n True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake people do exploit the blind fa=\r\nith of people, but the pendulum has swung too far and educated people have =\r\nlost faith so completely that it is almost cynical.\n\nThis is like lazy peop=\r\nle of a village who do not have the energy and patience to climb a hill nex=\r\nt to the village refusing to believe that anybody can climb that hill. Thus=\r\n, if someone climbs the hill, finds something nice on the hill and wants to=\r\n inspire others to climb it, such accounts will be inspiring.\n\nThe goal is =\r\nto inspire and enable a group of spiritual aspirants to do sadhana, become =\r\npowerful instruments of Nature and end up inspiring many more people. The u=\r\nltimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma of rishis in the world.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nWhen w=\r\ne went to Calcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temp=\r\nle. We could not find a hotel room as hotels were full and someone at a tem=\r\nple referred us to a nearby house that was being converted to a lodge. Hous=\r\ne owners lived upstairs. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told =\r\nme, &quot;we have a rina with this couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritua=\r\nl. We need to do something.&quot; We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. S=\r\nhe was indeed quite spiritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa and a regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.\n\nManish showe=\r\nd a very tall wall on one side of that property and asked them, &quot;is there a=\r\n smashaan (cemetary) on the other side of that wall&quot;. They said no. Manish =\r\nsaid, &quot;hmm, it somehow feels like that.&quot; That person clarified then, &quot;it is=\r\n a house and not a smashaan, but this house was a small mosque several deca=\r\ndes ago and they supposedly buried several people of that large family in t=\r\nhe backyard itself.&quot; After all, Manish&#39;s &quot;perception&quot; was correct.\n\nBTW, we=\r\n two ended up doing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next=\r\n to that wall.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nOn his advice, one lady started chanting Chandipath e=\r\nveryday to solve some problem with her son, which was bothering her very mu=\r\nch.\n\nOneday Manish talked to her daughter. He asked her, &quot;what is your moth=\r\ner doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but she is asking for weird thin=\r\ngs. Check with her and ask her to stop asking those things.&quot;\n\nWhen she corn=\r\nered her mother on what she was asking, her mother finally revealed that sh=\r\ne was frustrated with the situation with her son and so was asking Devi at =\r\nthe time of Chandipath to take her life so that she does not have to see he=\r\nr son&#39;s situation.\n\nHer daughter straightened her out and she stopped that.=\r\n As a postscript, her son&#39;s problem was solved after she did Chandipath for=\r\n a few more weeks.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nManish told me a few times that he &quot;knows&quot; when so=\r\nmeone thinks of him.\n\nWhen we were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manis=\r\nh said to me one evening, &quot;the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He =\r\nis thinking about me and money.&quot; Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a=\r\n minute and it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay fo=\r\nr the next day ahead instead of paying in the morning.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nManish came to =\r\nSeatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 and I met him physically for the =\r\nfirst time then. After lunch, we were walking around. Suddenly, Manish decl=\r\nared, &quot;there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant for your son close to here. I can=\r\n sense it. Let us go and find it.&quot; We walked quite a distance. Then he said=\r\n, &quot;this is the place.&quot; There was a big country market kind of place in a sm=\r\nall shopping complex. We went in, but found nothing. We came out of the com=\r\nplex. Manish looked around and said, &quot;no, this is the place. I was confused=\r\n by the smell from the fish market inside this complex. Let us try again.&quot; =\r\nWe went in again and this time Manish took me inside a small alley and ther=\r\ne was a small mom & pop kind of shop selling some Tibetan things. They had =\r\nseveral Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked one, bought it and gave it for my=\r\n son.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nI mentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he &quot;saw m=\r\ne&quot; doing my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK=\r\n. He lifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wif=\r\ne asked what he was doing. He said he told her, &quot;Narasimha is doing homam r=\r\night now. I am blessing him.&quot;\n\nWhen he mentioned this, I wanted to verify i=\r\nt. I normally wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cl=\r\noth and upper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wearing a blue veshti and=\r\n a blue T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only=\r\n twice until now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, &quot;if you =\r\nsaw me, tell me what kind of clothes I was wearing.&quot; He said, &quot;Narasimha, i=\r\nt seemed like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was als=\r\no another shade of blue.&quot; He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, th=\r\ne probability of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.\n\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n\nWhen we went to Pune, Delhi and Kurukshetra for the Krishna movie shooti=\r\nng, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bit early for the monsoon rains. Wh=\r\nen we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manish said that nature was pleased wi=\r\nth the work on Krishna and rains wherever we went was a sign. Sometimes Man=\r\nish says big-sounding things like this, which may give an impression that h=\r\ne is proud. But I realized that it is not because of pride, but he was simp=\r\nly making observations from the plane he is in. From where others are, they=\r\n may sound weird or proud or pretentious.\n\nI kind of dismissed him, &quot;well, =\r\nit could be a coincidence. It is very hot here right now and I see no cloud=\r\ns anywhere. If it rains here today, I will believe your theory.&quot;\n\nManish se=\r\nriously looked at the sky and nodded his head. Because it was too hot, we r=\r\netired into our room at the accommodation there, unpacked our stuff and got=\r\n tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we heard loud thunders. In a few min=\r\nutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that lasted half an hour. There were p=\r\nuddles of water everywhere. Manish remarked, &quot;see, it rained here also. God=\r\ns are happy with this work. This film is an important work.&quot; The rest of th=\r\ne day and next day was perfect and we shot what we wanted. \n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nDuring Ma=\r\nrch 2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Moth=\r\ner gave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was medi=\r\ntating in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were b=\r\noth meditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost nor=\r\nmal awareness of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange li=\r\nght. I saw that there was a person at the center of that light, who was emi=\r\nting that light. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, =\r\nhe suddenly transformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered =\r\n&quot;why did Manish change into that saint&quot;. That disturbed my focus and my reg=\r\nular self-awareness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha medita=\r\nting in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my =\r\neyes. At the same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anyt=\r\nhing, he asked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised that he\n knew it. However,=\r\n what baffled me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stutter=\r\ned, &quot;but...&quot;. Without my finishing it, he remarked, &quot;you see Narasimha, the=\r\n blessings of my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw h=\r\nim in me!&quot; He not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.\n\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\n=\r\nI was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was st=\r\nill on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my self=\r\n-awareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of electricity =\r\ngoing up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of that electri=\r\ncity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My changed perce=\r\nption was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was surging up =\r\nlike an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and that I wa=\r\ns a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a =\r\nspecific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of people, who wer=\r\ne all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated with the sound of=\r\n that beejaakshara and I perceived that I too was chanting that beejaakshar=\r\na along with all. My mind was filled with that sound and a kind of bliss. M=\r\ny self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled with that sound\n and jo=\r\ny and nothing else. I was unaware of anything else. Compared to my normal m=\r\nental state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic state to be in. I was i=\r\nn that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can be loosely expressed =\r\nas &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this loud sound? Are the=\r\nre people in the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought disturbed the state of=\r\n my mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I returned to the regular=\r\n level of self-awareness and again perceived that I was a body lying on a b=\r\ned in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again filled with hundreds of=\r\n thoughts as usual.\n=C2=A0\nI mentioned this incident a few days later to Ma=\r\nnish. When this happened, it was the middle of the night for me and morning=\r\n for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and said that I heard the sound =\r\nof a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in which I was a small particle=\r\n, Manish immediately said he knew it and also mentioned the specific beejaa=\r\nkshara and asked &quot;that is what you heard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. =\r\nMoreover, I had never meditated with that beejaakshara before and it is not=\r\n something one would expect me to have a mystical experience with.\n\nWhen I =\r\nconfirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light: &quot;I was=\r\n at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and f=\r\nilled my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some people close =\r\nto me may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should real=\r\nize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does and w=\r\nhy she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing what co=\r\nmes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire anything =\r\nto happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything=\r\n.&quot;\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n\nWhen Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, &quot;You are doing goo=\r\nd work by giving free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you =\r\nare not experiencing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awak=\r\nen and for you to start experiencing things&quot;. I thought he was crazy. He se=\r\nnt me a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra eve=\r\nryday using that maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keepi=\r\nng the back straight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Ru=\r\ndraaksha maalaa sent by him for many months before starting the practice he=\r\n wanted in May 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profou=\r\nnd and life changing within 18 days of starting the practice.\n\nWhen I menti=\r\noned what happened to him, he laughed and said, &quot;now an irreversible transf=\r\normation has been kicked off&quot;. He said, &quot;we two were born together many tim=\r\nes. Even if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled to=\r\nwards me. Such is our relationship. You don&#39;t know who you are and who I am=\r\n, but I do.&quot; He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004:=\r\n &quot;I did not have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I w=\r\nas in a trance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed wh=\r\natever digits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone.&quot;\n\nTh=\r\nough I still thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was t=\r\noo profound and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting to use=\r\n his maalaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to wonder if he was genuin=\r\ne after all, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I never=\r\n hid my thoughts from him and shared freely.\n\nMy journey since then has bee=\r\nn very interesting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someon=\r\ne said Rajarshi&#39;s mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed something =\r\nVimalananda- like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual=\r\n son to Vimalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don&#39;t know Vim=\r\nalananda, but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentioned by V=\r\nimalananda in &quot;Aghora&quot; series books being correct.\n\nDespite some of his sup=\r\nernatural abilities that I have seen, like the ability to create a specific=\r\n mystical experience in someone thousands of miles away, he insists that De=\r\nvi does everything and he is just a small instrument and an observer of Dev=\r\ni&#39;s leelaa and a small player in the big game of chess being played by Devi=\r\n. In fact, his main teaching to me was to improve devotion, faith and surre=\r\nnder and give up doership of my actions.\n\nHis teachings are sublime and yet=\r\n practical. He is not content to explain theory, but practically demonstrat=\r\nes the weaknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in =\r\nmodern pseudo-vedanta, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non=\r\n-duality at the same time. He made me understand things through experience.=\r\n He brought great change in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years =\r\nof interaction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my unde=\r\nrstanding and gave a much better perspective.\n\nMost importantly, using me a=\r\ns an instrument, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the a=\r\nncient Vedic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes=\r\n. He tells me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing hom=\r\nam on a regular basis one hundred years from now.\n\nAs I said at the beginni=\r\nng of this email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe re=\r\ngarding specific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the =\r\nformer.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nI will conclude with Manish&#39;s words I mentioned before:\n\n&quot;My m=\r\nessage is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is special. My ass=\r\nertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and should find=\r\n god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. As people d=\r\no homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be many peopl=\r\ne who make great progress. World will be a changed place.&quot;\n\n&quot;People should =\r\ndo sadhana.

However, there is one more angle=\r\n to consider.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish told me long back that we should guard against =\r\nfocusing on &quot;personalities&quot; and building awe. He said we should focus on sa=\r\ndhana. He said, &quot;my message is not that I am special, but it is that everyo=\r\nne is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyon=\r\ne can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybo=\r\ndy could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, the=\r\nre will be many people who make great progress. World will be a changed pla=\r\nce.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish said, &quot;people should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when y=\r\nou are on earth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhan=\r\na. Do whatever you can. If you know how to do\n homam, do homam. Otherwise d=\r\no japam. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some s=\r\nadhana or the other for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the resu=\r\nlts, but keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nI have personally seen clear indications that Manish operates on a differen=\r\nt plane compared to most people. I will give a few small examples in this w=\r\nriteup. However, I want to re-iterate that Manish does not see himself as a=\r\n special person or a &quot;man of god&quot; as you say, but sees himself as a small i=\r\nnstrument of Nature.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I mention any supernatural things involvin=\r\ng Manish, the goal is to show that such things are possible even now and no=\r\nt just limited to books and stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we &quot;educated =\r\ncity people&quot; lack faith. True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake people=\r\n do exploit the blind faith of people,\n but the pendulum has swung too far =\r\nand educated people have lost faith so completely that it is almost cynical=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is like lazy people of a village who do not have the energy a=\r\nnd patience to climb a hill next to the village refusing to believe that an=\r\nybody can climb that hill. Thus, if someone climbs the hill, finds somethin=\r\ng nice on the hill and wants to inspire others to climb it, such accounts w=\r\nill be inspiring.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The goal is to inspire and enable a group of spiri=\r\ntual aspirants to do sadhana, become powerful instruments of Nature and end=\r\n up inspiring many more people. The ultimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma =\r\nof rishis in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When we went to Calcutta to visit =\r\nDakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temple. We could not find a hote=\r\nl room as hotels were full and someone at a temple referred us to a nearby =\r\nhouse that was being converted\n to a lodge. House owners lived upstairs. We=\r\n checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told me, &quot;we have a rina with th=\r\nis couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritual. We need to do something.=\r\n&quot; We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. She was indeed quite spiritu=\r\nal. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and a re=\r\ngular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish showed a very tall wall on=\r\n one side of that property and asked them, &quot;is there a smashaan (cemetary) =\r\non the other side of that wall&quot;. They said no. Manish said, &quot;hmm, it someho=\r\nw feels like that.&quot; That person clarified then, &quot;it is a house and not a sm=\r\nashaan, but this house was a small mosque several decades ago and they supp=\r\nosedly buried several people of that large family in the backyard itself.&quot; =\r\nAfter all, Manish&#39;s &quot;perception&quot; was correct.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, we two ended up d=\r\noing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next to that\n wall.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On his advice, one lady started chanting Chandipath every=\r\nday to solve some problem with her son, which was bothering her very much.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oneday Manish talked to her daughter. He asked her, &quot;what is your mo=\r\nther doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but she is asking for weird th=\r\nings. Check with her and ask her to stop asking those things.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When =\r\nshe cornered her mother on what she was asking, her mother finally revealed=\r\n that she was frustrated with the situation with her son and so was asking =\r\nDevi at the time of Chandipath to take her life so that she does not have t=\r\no see her son&#39;s situation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Her daughter straightened her out and she=\r\n stopped that. As a postscript, her son&#39;s problem was solved after she did =\r\nChandipath for a few more weeks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish told\n me a few tim=\r\nes that he &quot;knows&quot; when someone thinks of him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When we were staying =\r\nat a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish said to me one evening, &quot;the hotel owner =\r\nis thinking of me right now. He is thinking about me and money.&quot; Interestin=\r\ngly, phone in the room rang in a minute and it was the hotel owner. He call=\r\ned to ask if we wanted to pay for the next day ahead instead of paying in t=\r\nhe morning.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish came to Seatle, USA for a conference in=\r\n fall 2005 and I met him physically for the first time then. After lunch, w=\r\ne were walking around. Suddenly, Manish declared, &quot;there is a rudraaksha ma=\r\nalaa meant for your son close to here. I can sense it. Let us go and find i=\r\nt.&quot; We walked quite a distance. Then he said, &quot;this is the place.&quot; There wa=\r\ns a big country market kind of place in a small shopping complex. We went i=\r\nn, but found nothing. We came out of the complex.\n Manish looked around and=\r\n said, &quot;no, this is the place. I was confused by the smell from the fish ma=\r\nrket inside this complex. Let us try again.&quot; We went in again and this time=\r\n Manish took me inside a small alley and there was a small mom &amp; pop ki=\r\nnd of shop selling some Tibetan things. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas=\r\n. Manish picked one, bought it and gave it for my son.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I m=\r\nentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he &quot;saw me&quot; doing my dail=\r\ny Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK. He lifted one =\r\nhand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wife asked what he =\r\nwas doing. He said he told her, &quot;Narasimha is doing homam right now. I am b=\r\nlessing him.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When he mentioned this, I wanted to verify it. I norma=\r\nlly wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth and up=\r\nper cloth) for my homam. That day I was\n wearing a blue veshti and a blue T=\r\n-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice un=\r\ntil now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, &quot;if you saw me, t=\r\nell me what kind of clothes I was wearing.&quot; He said, &quot;Narasimha, it seemed =\r\nlike some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was also another=\r\n shade of blue.&quot; He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, the probabi=\r\nlity of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;When we went to Pune, Delhi and Kurukshetra for the Krishna movie shoot=\r\ning, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bit early for the monsoon rains. W=\r\nhen we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manish said that nature was pleased w=\r\nith the work on Krishna and rains wherever we went was a sign. Sometimes Ma=\r\nnish says big-sounding things like this, which may give an impression that =\r\nhe is proud. But I realized that\n it is not because of pride, but he was si=\r\nmply making observations from the plane he is in. From where others are, th=\r\ney may sound weird or proud or pretentious.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I kind of dismissed him,=\r\n &quot;well, it could be a coincidence. It is very hot here right now and I see =\r\nno clouds anywhere. If it rains here today, I will believe your theory.&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish seriously looked at the sky and nodded his head. Because it was=\r\n too hot, we retired into our room at the accommodation there, unpacked our=\r\n stuff and got tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we heard loud thunders=\r\n. In a few minutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that lasted half an hour=\r\n. There were puddles of water everywhere. Manish remarked, &quot;see, it rained =\r\nhere also. Gods are happy with this work. This film is an important work.&quot; =\r\nThe rest of the day and next day was perfect and we shot what we wanted. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During\n March 2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal te=\r\nmple in Chennai where Mother gave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a =\r\nhomam movement, I was meditating in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in =\r\nfront of Manish. We were both meditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After h=\r\nalf hour or so, I lost normal awareness of my body and I felt like I was so=\r\nme all-pervading orange light. I saw that there was a person at the center =\r\nof that light, who was emiting that light. When I looked closer, it was Man=\r\nish. After a little time, he suddenly transformed into a very famous saint =\r\nfrom the past. I wondered &quot;why did Manish change into that saint&quot;. That dis=\r\nturbed my focus and my regular self-awareness returned and I became aware t=\r\nhat I was Narasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in=\r\n front of me. I opened my eyes. At the same time, Manish also opened his ey=\r\nes. Without my saying anything, he asked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised =\r\nthat he knew it.\n However, what baffled me the most was why he transformed =\r\ninto that saint. I stuttered, &quot;but...&quot;. Without my finishing it, he remarke=\r\nd, &quot;you see Narasimha, the blessings of my guru of last life are still with=\r\n me. That is why you saw him in me!&quot; He not only knew what I saw, but expla=\r\nined it succintly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of=\r\n the night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my =\r\nshakti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceiv=\r\ned a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split s=\r\necond, my perception of that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to=\r\n &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My changed perception was that there was a tremendous a=\r\nmount of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing eve=\r\nrything that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendo=\r\nus wave.\n Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted to=\r\ngether by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. Tha=\r\nt wave reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived tha=\r\nt I too was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled w=\r\nith that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny pa=\r\nrticle filled with that sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of an=\r\nything else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and y=\r\net fantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a th=\r\nought that can be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How a=\r\nm I hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mind.=\r\n That thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In ot=\r\nher words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perc=\r\neived that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mi=\r\nnd\n was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;I men=\r\ntioned this incident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was=\r\n the middle of the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned th=\r\ne incident and said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating =\r\nin the wave in which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he kne=\r\nw it and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what y=\r\nou heard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated =\r\nwith that beejaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me t=\r\no have a mystical experience with.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I confirmed that was the bee=\r\njaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light: &quot;I was at that time meditating w=\r\nith that beejaakshara. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I =\r\nthen went into a nice samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experi=\r\nenced that deity at that time. But we should realize that this is all\n Her =\r\nplay and we are just nimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows an=\r\nd we do not. We are just dummies observing what comes our way. We neither m=\r\nake anything happen nor should we desire anything to happen. Just be and ob=\r\nserve. Do not be attracted or repelled by anything.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When =\r\nManish called me in mid-2004, he told me, &quot;You are doing good work by givin=\r\ng free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you are not experie=\r\nncing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awaken and for you =\r\nto start experiencing things&quot;. I thought he was crazy. He sent me a Rudraak=\r\nsha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra everyday using tha=\r\nt maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keeping the back str=\r\naight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Rudraaksha maalaa=\r\n sent by him for many months before starting the practice he\n wanted in May=\r\n 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profound and life ch=\r\nanging within 18 days of starting the practice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I mentioned wha=\r\nt happened to him, he laughed and said, &quot;now an irreversible transformation=\r\n has been kicked off&quot;. He said, &quot;we two were born together many times. Even=\r\n if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled towards me=\r\n. Such is our relationship. You don&#39;t know who you are and who I am, but I =\r\ndo.&quot; He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004: &quot;I did =\r\nnot have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I was in a =\r\ntrance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed whatever d=\r\nigits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thou=\r\ngh I still thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was too=\r\n profound and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting to use h=\r\nis maalaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to\n wonder if he was genuine=\r\n after all, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I never =\r\nhid my thoughts from him and shared freely.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My journey since then ha=\r\ns been very interesting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. S=\r\nomeone said Rajarshi&#39;s mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed somet=\r\nhing Vimalananda- like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spir=\r\nitual son to Vimalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw Vimalananda, but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentioned=\r\n by Vimalananda in &quot;Aghora&quot; series books being correct.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Despite some=\r\n of his supernatural abilities that I have seen, like the ability to create=\r\n a specific mystical experience in someone thousands of miles away, he insi=\r\nsts that Devi does everything and he is just a small instrument and an obse=\r\nrver of Devi&#39;s leelaa and a small player in the big game of chess being pla=\r\nyed by Devi. In fact, his main teaching to\n me was to improve devotion, fai=\r\nth and surrender and give up doership of my actions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His teachings a=\r\nre sublime and yet practical. He is not content to explain theory, but prac=\r\ntically demonstrates the weaknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Inste=\r\nad of swimming in modern pseudo-vedanta, he made me understand and apprecia=\r\nte duality and non-duality at the same time. He made me understand things t=\r\nhrough experience. He brought great change in my attitude and thinking in t=\r\nhe last 5.5 years of interaction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the h=\r\norizons of my understanding and gave a much better perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most=\r\n importantly, using me as an instrument, he enabled many sincere spiritual =\r\nseekers to embrace the ancient Vedic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritu=\r\nal for saattwik purposes. He tells me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) =\r\npeople will be doing homam on a regular basis one hundred years from now.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I said at the beginning of\n this email, inspiring sadhana is more =\r\nimportant than inspiring awe regarding specific personalities, though the l=\r\natter sometimes helps with the former.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will conclude wit=\r\nh Manish&#39;s words I mentioned before:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;My message is not that I am sp=\r\necial, but it is that everyone is special. My assertion is not that I found=\r\n god, but it is that everyone can and should find god. I am a normal person=\r\n. If I could find god, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely and unse=\r\nlfishly for a few years, there will be many people who make great progress.=\r\n World will be a changed place.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;People should do sadhana. Don&#39;t wa=\r\nste time when you are on earth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know h=\r\now to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homa=\r\nm. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s n=\r\name. Do some sadhana or the\n other for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry=\r\n about the results, but keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 1/18/10, =\r\nchaudhuri.krishnend u &lt;I&gt;&lt;krishnenduchdhr@ gmail.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: chaud=\r\nhuri.krishnend u &lt;krishnenduchdhr@ gmail.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Resected Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Mon=\r\nday, January 18, 2010, 2:06 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv630583455&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;From time to time various sayings and inc=\r\nidents related to Manishji are scattered in this forum and maybe at other p=\r\nlaces.His site also contains&lt;BR&gt;some valuable materials.Will it not be nice=\r\n to archive them as i feel they are great pieces of inspiration.
