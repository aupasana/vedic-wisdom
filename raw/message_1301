Vibrations do vary from place to place. \nThe vibrations of the place do not matter to some, but do matter to many.\n\nPlaces with taamasic vibrations are not necessarily bad for sadhana for \neveryone. When one is pure and succeeds in sadhana at such places, one can \nmake faster progress.\n\nA smashaana (cemetary) has decidedly stronger tamasik vibrations than \nbasements completely under ground. But several great yogis in some \ntraditions did sadhana in smashana and realized self. Nevertheless it is not \nconducive to fruitful sadhana by most people.\n\nAn average person is better off doing sadhana in places without such \nvibrations, atleast initially. So I do not recommend doing spiritual sadhana \nin underground basements. There will be exceptions, but this is a safe and \nprudent position to take.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, February 24, 2009 12:20 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Puja Room in Basement- Vaastu Issues\n\n\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; If what you suggest is true, than in India a lot of seers did sadhana\n&gt; for many years in caves and many of them are underground too ...\n&gt; I have seen some of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I donot think underground=tamasic.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact many ashrams in India I have seen have basement type rooms as\n&gt; meditation halls.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any clean place is good, In Guru Gita Lord Shiva has described\n&gt; the types of asana materials and direction of seat.\n&gt;\n&gt; As per guru gita, west is considered good for wealth and woollen\n&gt; asana of yellowish color.\n&gt; There are more definitions one each for north, east and south.
