Na=\r\nrasimhaji, you say &quot;Depending on how you visualize a devatA and mantra and =\r\nwith what attitude, it works on you accordingly, within that range of possi=\r\nbilities&quot;. It seems to me that this visualization is a very personal intern=\r\nal image, very alive and active? In my case, and my knowledge is but a smal=\r\nl fraction of yours, when doing Savitur Gayatri, I visualize a golden peace=\r\n descending on me, and something flowing out of me to something higher. My =\r\nvisualization during the Kali mantra is of surrendering all of myself, as i=\r\nf I were cleaning out myself from the inside out, to some vague but very fi=\r\nerce Goddess form, and all my faults coming out of me like snakes, which ar=\r\ne destroyed by the Goddess. I have reached these visualizations by trial an=\r\nd error - when I do these ones, I seem to concentrate on the mantra much be=\r\ntter. But I wonder if this is conflicting imagery.. Also I have trouble str=\r\nongly visualizing personified forms - most of the focus is always on colors=\r\n, flows etc.. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Sundeep,\n&gt; \n&gt; When one d=\r\noes different mantras, they of course interfere with each \n&gt; other. But do =\r\nnot think in terms of deity X and deity Y not liking each \n&gt; other and doin=\r\ng their mantras together making them angry with you, etc. \n&gt; Deities are fa=\r\nr more subtle than us.\n&gt; \n&gt; If my son asks me how to study math, I may tell=\r\n him to study for half \n&gt; hour, take some rest, have a snack, and study aga=\r\nin. If he asks my wife \n&gt; the same thing, she may tell him sternly to study=\r\n for 4 hours, before \n&gt; breaking. He better ask one of us and stick to what=\r\n that person says. If \n&gt; he asks both and we give different directions, he =\r\nwill be confused. It \n&gt; is not that I and my wife dislike each other for gi=\r\nving a different \n&gt; advice. I know her and I am not surprised by her advice=\r\n. Similarly, she \n&gt; knows me and she is not surprised by my advice. But it =\r\nis better for my \n&gt; son to follow one approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, approach of=\r\n savitA and kALI may be different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, it is not just deity&#39;s n=\r\name or mantra. It is in your attitude \n&gt; and how you visualize/imagine the =\r\ndeity (consciously or even \n&gt; sub-consciously). I, for example, do a Chandi=\r\n homam every morning. After \n&gt; the homam, as the poornaahuti burns, I medit=\r\nate for half hour with \n&gt; savitR^i gAyatrI mantra. I do not feel weird abou=\r\nt mixing chanDIpAtha \n&gt; (durgA saptashati) and gAyatrI mantra. Even as I in=\r\nvoke Chandi in fire \n&gt; and read durgAsaptashati, I visualize Aadyaa Mahalak=\r\nshmi, the shakti of \n&gt; the supreme cosmic being, who divided herself into M=\r\nahalakshmi, Mahakali \n&gt; and Mahasaraswati. The dhyana shloka I use for invo=\r\ncation is \n&gt; &quot;sarvasyAdyA mahAlakShmI triguNA parameshvarI lakShyAlakShyasv=\r\narUpA yA \n&gt; vyApya kR^itsnaM vyavasthitA...&quot; So my visualization of the dev=\r\nata is \n&gt; highly saattwik and close to that of savitA and sAvitrI!\n&gt; \n&gt; Som=\r\neone else may be visualizing Chandi as someone fierce and angry and \n&gt; cutt=\r\ning off heads with umpteen weapons etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each devatA and mantra has a r=\r\nange of possibilities. Depending on how \n&gt; you visualize a devatA and mantr=\r\na and with what attitude, it works on \n&gt; you accordingly, within that range=\r\n of possibilities. It is always better \n&gt; to stick to one mantra for a few =\r\nmonths or years. Of course, people who \n&gt; have such dense conditioning that=\r\n mantras do not really have any \n&gt; immediately visible impact on their cons=\r\nciousness, may do as many \n&gt; mantras as they want. If you see that some man=\r\ntras are having a visible \n&gt; impact on you, it is a good sign. But it is be=\r\ntter then to use the \n&gt; feedback and stick to one mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may want=\r\n to experiment with homam with the Kali mantra that is \n&gt; helping you deal =\r\nwith your problems better.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Kali yuga, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra a=\r\nnd Chandipath are two stotras \n&gt; that are said to work effectively. Conside=\r\nr experimenting with \n&gt; Chandipath, perhaps one chapter a day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOn Thu, Jul 14, 2011 at 1:13 AM, vedicastrostudent wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Dear Nar=\r\nasimhaji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; I used to meditatively listen to/chant the Savitu=\r\nr Gayatri every \n&gt; morning, and on the weekends, I did a homam also (doing =\r\nthe Savitur \n&gt; Gayatri). Gayatri, especially in Homan seems to make things =\r\nawaken in \n&gt; me, even with a tinge of sexual desire, yet still making me mo=\r\nre \n&gt; spiritual. Separately, for the past few months, I have been having th=\r\nis \n&gt; heavy weight of a depressive feeling (due to several events/situation=\r\ns \n&gt; in my life) which just hasnt left me, and even the Gayatri/Homam doesn=\r\nt \n&gt; relieve except immediately after a Homam for less than a day. After so=\r\nme \n&gt; reading around and doing some astrology, I finally arrived at a Kali =\r\n\n&gt; mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye namah, and I have started meditating on that =\r\n\n&gt; every morning, but I still do weekend homams with Savitur Gayatri. But \n=\r\n&gt; things have changed now. The Kali mantra is very punishing in a mental \n&gt;=\r\n tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal with mental hardship \n&gt; wit=\r\nhout completely giving up/getting angry/stressed. So I have continued \n&gt; it=\r\n. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the Gayatri results seems a \n&gt; bi=\r\nt weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I dont meditate on the Kali \n&gt; mant=\r\nra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try to drop a day of doing \n&gt; Kali m=\r\nantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. Is there some kind \n&gt; of con=\r\nflict between the two?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
