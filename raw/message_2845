This tithi is auspicious for Kaala Bhairava worship.\n \nKaala Bhairava is a form of Shiva. Kaala Bhairava means &quot;who Time is afraid of&quot;. While Time devours all, Kaala Bhairava has tamed Time. He dissolves the delusion and duality in the mind, makes one fearless and dispassionate, increases detachment and grants liberation. His worship in fire is very auspicious and accelerates spiritual progress and liberation.\n \nThose who are interested in Kaala Bhairava homam can download the manual at the homam website:\n \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n \n*        *        *\n \nSome people offer wine in fire in Kaala Bhairava homam. I have taken a stand against it as per Manish&#39;s advice. The following is from the manual.\n \nIs Alcohol Allowed in Kaala Bhairava Homam\n \nSome people offer wine/alcohol in a homam to Kaala Bhairava. We do not recommended it. While Kaala Bhairava is a form of god who saves one from duality and does not distinguish between alcohol and ghee, the medium we use for making offerings to him is Havyavaaha Agni who does not like wine. A sadhaka who is still mired in duality and who looks at ghee and wine differently and whose body and mind react differently to them, is better off propitiating using Havyavaaha Agni using regular auspicious materials. If a sadhaka on the verge of overcoming distinctions and duality wants to test oneself and go further, one may perform Kaala Bhairava homam in a smashaana (cemetary), skip the &quot;kravyaadamagnim&quot; mantra in &quot;agni pratishthaapana&quot; step and make any offering without restrictions, including wine.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
