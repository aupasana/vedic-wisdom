If one has a deep attachment \nto the body, mind may be attached to the body even after death, even after \nthe connection of the karmendriyas and jnanendriyas of the mind to the \nphysical body is cut off. Then what happens to the body does affect the mind \nand its further progress.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen one takes sannyasa, i.e renounces material world, the last rites are to \nbe done symbolically. After that, one is dead symbolically. However, if one \ndoes not have true renunciation and detachment from body, relatives and \nother material objects, there is no point in taking sannyasa or doing \nsymbolic last rites. Even if one does it, mind may still be attached to the \nbody. If last rites are not done after death, even a sannyasi&#39;s mind may \nhave problems. On the other hand, a true sannyasi who is absolutely detached \nfrom the body even when alive will fly high when mind is finally freed from \nthe body at death.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne cannot control what others do with one&#39;s body after one leaves it. So \nthe wisest course of action would be to develop detachment even when alive. \nDivert the concern for the well-being of the body towards other people. Do \nbare minimum to keep the body alive and not be overly concerned about it. \nWhen you meditate, think only of god and try to forget that there is a body \nthat you occupy. Even if leg hurts or neck itches, try to forget about it. \nIf you ignore body for a while, it will cry out for attention, like an \nimmature child who needs attention. If you give it attention, you cannot \nexperience god. But, as you ignore body more, body will try more to get your \nattention (like an immature child who needs attention)! However, if you \npersist, body will have to eventually give up! THAT is when one can absorb \nthe mind fully in god.\n\nIf one experiences that often while alive, that experience helps immensely \nat death. When the mind leaves the body for the last time, one can focus \nmind on god and ignore the attention grabbing cries for help from the body. \nOne who successfully focuses mind on god when the last moment comes is \nliberated and gets saayujya or moksha. On the other hand, one who wavers \nfrom the focus on god and lets mind turn towards the plight of the dying \nbody gets stuck.\n\nTo a yogi, each session of deep meditation is like a dress rehearsal of the \nlast moment! Death is not to be feared. If faced correctly, it is the moment \nof final liberation. Life is meant to be a practice for it!\n\nInstead of worrying about body and its last rites, let every ritual be a \nlast rite! I suggest that one should practice detachment and develop the \nability to absolutely ignore the pitiful cries of the body for attention as \none tries to focus the mind on god and succeed in absorbing the mind in god \nwhen meditating. If one practices that, the issue of who does last rites and \nwhat rites becomes irrelevant.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOf course, one who performs brilliantly in dress rehearsals may still forget \none&#39;s lines or put a wrong expression when playing the drama finally on the \nbig stage. Similarly, a yogi who has overcome the attachment to body and \nabsorbed the mind perfectly in god many times may still waver at the last \nmoment and think of body or something else that is impermenant and be \nreborn.\n\nHowever, all that is in our control is to practice and prepare for the last \nmoment.\n\n*        *        *\n\nYou are lucky. There are many Hindus who do not experience anything like \nwhat you described. Keep doing sadhana and overcome the little rawness that \nmay still be left in the consciousness.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; I seek you advise on this rather peculiar question and I hope you will\n&gt; find the time to answer me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was born into a non Hindu family. My family members were staunch\n&gt; believers in their religion. From an early age of 6, I regularly used\n&gt; to have dreams of Hindu deities. And even when watching Hindu\n&gt; religious movies, I would always feel a rush of energy and electric\n&gt; shock like feelings in my body, especially when deities are shown.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then from age 12, I was left with a Hindu family for a couple of\n&gt; years. I was brought by this foster family to Hindu temples every week\n&gt; and also for Thaipusam. This was my first love with the Hindu\n&gt; religion. I just felt so energised praying at temples. Such a feeling\n&gt; was never experienced in my family&#39;s place of worship.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then over the years I was left on my own and got married and had a son\n&gt; etc. My wife was of yet another religion and my son followed his mom.\n&gt; And I used to accompany them to pray.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet despite all my experiences with 4 major religions, I only feel\n&gt; that I have reached my destiny with Hinduism. For the past 3 years I\n&gt; regularly go temples, perform homams (at the temples) and also do\n&gt; japams. Lately with your instructions I have started homams at home.\n&gt;\n&gt; I find myself being drawn and helped by some divine force to learn\n&gt; more and more. Knowledge and people somehow come together to guide me\n&gt; and to pull me along this spiritual path. I find tremendous peace and\n&gt; love fills my heart when I am at temples or at home doing poojas and\n&gt; japams. Even when I sleep and wake up in the middle of the night, I\n&gt; find my mind reciting mantras.  Sometimes while performing japam my\n&gt; body starts to shake uncontrollably or tears flow or I perspire\n&gt; profusely (even in air-con environment). These events lead me to\n&gt; believe I am on the right path.\n&gt;\n&gt; I truly believe Hinduism IS MY DESTINY.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now to my question.\n&gt;\n&gt; When my soul departs my body I have no family member who would perform\n&gt; the Hindu rites. I live on my own and my son is studying overseas. And\n&gt; I am sure non of my family members would respect my wishes and grant\n&gt; me my wish to be accorded the Hindu rites. Anyway I am not with them.\n&gt;\n&gt; So is there any way, where I can &quot;pre-perform&quot; the last rites for\n&gt; myself prior to my death knowing that this is the only way to be\n&gt; certain that family and society would not interfere.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of my friends said something like the body is just a waste after\n&gt; death, so it does not matter what religious rites are provided.\n&gt;\n&gt; But is this correct? Isn&#39;t some rites needed to be performed for the\n&gt; soul (atma shanti)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Forgive me if my question sounds somewhat weird. But I hope you would\n&gt; appreciate my predicament especially in view of my background.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your time reading this long email. Please help provide\n&gt; some guidance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Warmest Regards.\n\n\n"}}
