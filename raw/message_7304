Then we talk of rules wha=\r\nt must be done to the departed, why only sesame, etc. So, the rule here is =\r\nthe existing parent gets the permission / authority or whatever we want to =\r\ncall it, to please his ancestors who are departed. When the ancestors are a=\r\nlive, any one can meet him; even his uncles, friends, neighbours, etc. If b=\r\ny the same logic, any one can do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues, just=\r\n that I am not yet convinced :-)\n\nLike I mentioned, to each his / her own. =\r\nFrankly, I have seen mundane logic stops somewhere for most of the rituals;=\r\n that is when we look for other learned&#39;s inputs or shastra&#39;s inputs. \n\nAga=\r\nin, I am merely stating what I was told as even I was prepared to start tar=\r\npanam for this pitr paksha until I was told and realized it is against some=\r\n shastras. \n\nOn the root of the tree example, I was going with this, http:/=\r\n/www.asitis.com/9/25.html\n\nWithout flaming on the devas !=3D demigods :-), =\r\nif there are any insights you can offer on why Lord mentioned it like this =\r\nfrom any other angle, it will be much appreciated.\n\nLastly, thanks for your=\r\n inputs.\n\nregards\nrAma\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishn=\r\nan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rama,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; an acting CEO or acting=\r\n prime minister does not exist when the real CEO or\n&gt; PM exists.\n&gt; &gt; So the=\r\n tarpanam has to be done by the generation that is alive; if father,\n&gt; else=\r\n son.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This kind of analogy may be relevant if one is trying to exer=\r\ncise one&#39;s\n&gt; authority and power over another. However, we are discussing t=\r\narpana\n&gt; (literally &quot;to please&quot;). In the presence of a living father, a bet=\r\nter\n&gt; analogy is that of &quot;going to visit a grandfather who lives elsewhere&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt; Certainly, the father should visit the grandfather. Does this mean that=\r\n the\n&gt; grandson should not visit the grandfather? And, when it comes to ple=\r\nasing\n&gt; the grandfather, is there a monopoly? Most grandparents get a speci=\r\nal kind\n&gt; of a pleasure from their grandkids. All analogies have their limi=\r\nts, but the\n&gt; CEO analogy, IMO, misses the point.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pouring water t=\r\no the roots takes care of the whole of the plant / tree.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When all o=\r\nther circumstances and factors are conducive to it, merely pouring\n&gt; water =\r\nto the roots takes care of the tree. This is not as easy as it\n&gt; seems. Mos=\r\nt trees from India will not survive the cold weather of North\n&gt; America ...=\r\n regardless of how much you water it. In advaita, mere gyana is\n&gt; necessary=\r\n ... but it takes lifetimes of strenuous karma yoga to reach this\n&gt; point. =\r\nMerely reciting a mantra is sufficient ... but it takes lifetimes to\n&gt; deve=\r\nlop the perfect bhakti that must accompany it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looks like to each=\r\n his / her own.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Those who feel strongly can certainly start with th=\r\ne deva and rishi tarpana\n&gt; :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; \n&gt;    ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 12:39 AM, Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; N=\r\namaste.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One learned person I know gave an example that an acting CE=\r\nO or acting\n&gt; &gt; prime minister does not exist when the real CEO or PM exist=\r\ns.
