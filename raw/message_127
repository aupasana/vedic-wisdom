A=\r\nssisi \n\nURL of this page: http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?\nid=\r\n=3D071507063046\n\n\nAmericans have been engaged in Hindu-bashing for more tha=\r\nn a hundred \nyears. (I have dwelt on this aspect previously: \nhttp://www.mo=\r\ndelminority.com/article1017.html). And it&#39;s not just \nwriters like Katherin=\r\ne Mayo or films like `Indiana Jones and the \nTemple of Doom;&#39; the web too h=\r\nas a surfeit of anti-Hindu propaganda. \n\nIn recent years Indian Americans h=\r\nave been concerned about the \nstereotypes about India and Hinduism that are=\r\n taught as fact in \nAmerican classrooms. They know it will negatively impac=\r\nt students of \nIndian or South Asian origin who are struggling to work out =\r\ntheir \nidentity in a multicultural, predominately Anglo-Christian \nenvironm=\r\nent. \n\nMoreover, some academicians too are engaged in Hindu-bashing. For \ni=\r\nnstance, scholars have disparaged the Bhagavad Gita as &quot;a dishonest \nbook&quot;;=\r\n declared Ganesha&#39;s trunk a &quot;limp phallus&quot;; classified Devi as \nthe &quot;mother=\r\n with a penis&quot; and Shiva as &quot;a notorious womanizer&quot; who \nincites violence i=\r\nn India; pronounced Sri Ramakrishna a pedophile who \nsexually molested the =\r\nyoung Swami Vivekananda; condemned Indian \nmothers as being less loving of =\r\ntheir children than white women; and \ninterpreted the bindi as a drop of me=\r\nnstrual fluid and the &quot;ha&quot; in \nsacred mantras as a woman&#39;s sound during org=\r\nasm. \n\nThis depiction of Hinduism in a manner perceived as provocatively \nd=\r\nemeaning by the Hindus themselves is the subject of a recent \nbook: `Invadi=\r\nng the Sacred- An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in \nAmerica.&#39; It is a seriou=\r\ns and significant response to the challenge \nposed by Hinduphobia in Americ=\r\na. And it now calls upon all fair \nminded Americans and Hindus to read the =\r\nbook, and take steps to bring \nthe vilification of India and of Hinduism to=\r\n an end. \n\nThe first person within the Indian-American community to bring \n=\r\nHinduphobia, or distortions and negative portrayals of the Hindu \nreligion =\r\nout into the open was Rajiv Malhotra. Since at least 2002, \nhis single mind=\r\ned campaigning, his scholarly criticisms, and his \ncourageous stance has br=\r\nought the issue into focus =96 thanks to the \nworld-wide-web. In many of th=\r\nese articles, Malhotra argues that \nmisinterpretations of Indian culture, e=\r\nspecially philosophy and \nreligion have created a Hinduism for American soc=\r\niety that is very \ndifferent from the religious philosophy as practiced by =\r\nits \nfollowers. \n\nThe core complaint that Malhotra asserts is that the curr=\r\nent \neducation system and media in the USA and India are deeply and \nuncons=\r\nciously Eurocentric =96 a system that is breeding the next \ngeneration of E=\r\nurocentric Americans, and that many Indians have \nadopted this Eurocentric =\r\ntrend also. Malhotra, who studied physics at \nIndia&#39;s St. Stephens College =\r\nand computer science at Syracuse \nUniversity, now works full time at the In=\r\nfinity Foundation, a \nnonprofit he founded in 1995 to &quot;upgrade the quality =\r\nof understanding \nof Indian civilization in the American media and educatio=\r\nnal system, \nas well as among the English language educated Indian elite.&quot; =\r\n\n\nIn September 2002, Malhotra wrote an article criticizing the \nrepresentat=\r\nion of Hindu religion in the North American discipline of \nReligious Studie=\r\ns on Sulekha.com, a web portal popular among the \nIndian diaspora. The arti=\r\ncle, named &quot;Wendy&#39;s Child Syndrome,&quot; \nidentified a number of American schol=\r\nars in Religious Studies working \non Hinduism, arguing against their suitab=\r\nility to write or teach \nabout Hindu religion, instigating debate within th=\r\ne academe. \nMalhotra&#39;s summaries of the concerned writings and his evaluati=\r\nons of \nthe scholars involved, caused an indignant uproar on the Internet \n=\r\namongst Hindus, primarily Indian Hindus, all over the world and \nparticular=\r\nly in North America. In follow-up columns, Malhotra \ncontinued with his arg=\r\nument about the necessity of the Indian \ndiaspora to wake up to such misrep=\r\nresentations. These portrayals, he \nasserts, are responsible for the negati=\r\nve image of Indians and \nHindus, leading to their racist treatment in Ameri=\r\ncan society. His \narticles garnered some of the highest number of readers a=\r\nnd drew the \nlargest number of comments. \n\nMalhotra condemned &quot;the eroticis=\r\nation of Hinduism by Wendy Doniger, \nwho is undoubtedly the most powerful p=\r\nerson in academic Hinduism \nStudies today,&quot; and &quot;her large cult of students=\r\n, who glorify her in \nexchange for her mentorship.&quot; He noted that religious=\r\n studies=97a field \nthat teaches about a religion without preaching its bel=\r\niefs=97is rare \nin India, making academic discussions of Hinduism a mostly =\r\nWestern \nconversation. &quot;Under Western control,&quot; he argued, &quot;Hinduism studie=\r\ns \nhas produced ridiculous caricatures that could easily be turned into \na =\r\nBollywood movie or a TV serial.&quot; \n\nIndeed, Malhotra was the first to voice =\r\nhis concerns regarding the \nmisrepresentation of Hinduism in America, when =\r\nhe noted: \n\n=95 Hindu kids and even adults in America are apologetic about =\r\ntheir \nreligion, generally preferring to distance themselves from it and \nk=\r\neep quiet about it. =95 Educational material used to teach about \nHinduism =\r\nfocuses on caste, idol worship, lack of social values among \nHindus, and ot=\r\nher negative portrayals. =95 A major academic web site \nexamines the Bhagav=\r\nad Gita in negative terms of Arjuna killing his \nrelatives because of his H=\r\nindu outlook. =95 Teaching grants to train \nsecondary school teachers on re=\r\nligious pluralism have been used to \ndevelop material that portrays Rama as=\r\n &#39;oppressing&#39; women and lower \ncastes. =95 There is minimal coverage given =\r\nto the positive \ncontributions by India&#39;s civilization to mathematics, scie=\r\nnce, \nmedicine, metallurgy, linguistics, logic, and other &#39;rational&#39; areas;=\r\n \nand when pointed out, such avoidance is sometimes defended. =95 Most of \n=\r\nthe educational material on Indic religions is written very \nauthoritativel=\r\ny by Americans who have advanced degrees in Sanskrit \nand/or Religious Stud=\r\nies, who have spent years researching in India, \nand would easily impress a=\r\nnyone with their scriptural knowledge about \nIndia. =95 Very few Indians ha=\r\nve gone for academic careers in Religion \nor Philosophy, and those in such =\r\ncareers must be very cautious not to \nstep out of line in complaining about=\r\n the above matters. \n\nV. V. Raman, Emeritus Professor Rochester Institute o=\r\nf Technology \nsays: &quot;Mr. Malhotra is a serious and well-grounded scholar. H=\r\ne did \nnot come to this field via the standard academic route, but his \nwri=\r\ntings reflect more erudition and a greater grasp of important \nissues than =\r\nmany Ph.D.&#39;s I know. =85Because of his firm stand and \nsometimes angry styl=\r\ne, he has angered the Western academic \nestablishment on Indology, and alie=\r\nnated a great many, including some \nHindu scholars=85But he has also shaken=\r\n many to look deeper into the \nassumptions and unrecognized prejudices whic=\r\nh shape their \ninterpretations. And he has served as a bold and well-inform=\r\ned voice \nfor many Hindus in the West as well as in India who have often fe=\r\nlt \nhurt and insulted by some of the psychoanalytic interpretations of \nthe=\r\nir culture and divinities. Personally, I don&#39;t agree with Mr. \nMalhotra&#39;s s=\r\ntyle and mode, and I don&#39;t always resonate with his \ndemarcation lines betw=\r\neen the East and the West, but I have great \nrespect for his scholarship, m=\r\nuch sympathy for the core of his \ntheses, and I applaud his long-range goal=\r\n. One more thing: To my \nknowledge, he is not affiliated with any Hindu `fu=\r\nndamentalist&#39; \ngroup. \n\nAnant Rambachan, Professor of Religion, Saint Olaf =\r\nCollege in \nMinnesota writes: &quot;Rajiv Malhotra is a prominent and insistent =\r\nvoice \nquestioning and inviting dialogue with the scholarly community, on \n=\r\nthe content and methodology of studying and teaching Hinduism at \ninstituti=\r\nons of higher education in North America. This initial \ncollection offers a=\r\n salient summary of his critique and concerns, and \nis a valuable historica=\r\nl resource for those who want to understand \nbetter this debate, and those =\r\nwho wish to become participants in the \nconversation that he has passionate=\r\nly initiated and sustained. \nScholars should welcome a critical voice from =\r\nthe community that is \nthe focus of their study, for a mutually enriching d=\r\nialogue.&quot; \n\nIn his preface to the book, Arvind Sharma, Professor of Religio=\r\nn at \nMcGill University, writes: `The book singes with the sparks that flew=\r\n \nas the psychoanalytic approach to the study of religion became the \nlight=\r\nning rod of the grievances of the Hindu Americans against a \ncross-section =\r\nof the academic community in North America devoted to \nthe study of Hinduis=\r\nm. It goes on to document the way these \ngrievances were articulated and ve=\r\nntilated, as well as the response \nfrom the world of the Western academia a=\r\nnd, to a certain extent, from \nthe media, as the issue came to a head. Most=\r\n importantly, the book is \na pointer to the fact that the Hindu community i=\r\nn North America has \nnow reached the demographic critical mass, when its re=\r\nactions can no \nlonger be disregarded.&#39; \nThe book, edited by Krishnan Ramas=\r\nwamy, Aditi Banerjee, and Antonio \nT. de Nicolas, probes the invisible netw=\r\norks behind biased approaches \nto Hinduism and the questionable scholarship=\r\n of the American experts \non Hinduism. Furthermore it goes on to narrate th=\r\ne Indian Diaspora&#39;s \nrecent challenges to such scholarship, and documents h=\r\now those who \ndared to speak up - including academic scholars critical of s=\r\nuch \nscholarship - have been branded as &quot;dangerous&quot;. \n\nThe authors of this =\r\nstudy say that today Hinduism is under siege by \nforces who have found thei=\r\nr playing fields in a section of the \nAmerican Academy of Religion and the =\r\nDepartments of South Asia \nStudies. Their game plan is to denigrate Hinduis=\r\nm by focusing \nnarrowly on its social ills, misinterpreting its texts and i=\r\nn the \nprocess overlooking the substantial content of Hinduism, its \nunequa=\r\nlled intellectual wealth, the fact that India has, by virtue of \nHinduism a=\r\nnd Sanskrit, `a place in the history of the human mind&#39; as \nMax Mueller onc=\r\ne noted. \n\nKapil Kapur, Former Chair of Department of English, Jawaharlal N=\r\nehru \nUniversity, opines: &quot;The intellectuals featured in this book, with \nt=\r\nheir bold decision to take on this scholarship, have entered into a \nseriou=\r\ns dialogue about motives, methodology and substance and, using \ntheir own t=\r\nools, have reversed the gaze back on to the scholarly \nestablishment to the=\r\nir understandable discomfort. This book is \nimportant because it records th=\r\ne background, the issues and the \narguments in this debate, and the debate =\r\nis not over. This has been a \nhistoric intervention. The record of this ent=\r\nerprise is a lesson for \na large number of young Hindus who must learn to c=\r\nombat adverse \nwestern scholarship by using the weapons of the enemy.&quot; \n\nBa=\r\nl Ram Singh, Director, Center for Indic Studies, University of \nMassachuset=\r\nts, Dartmouth, points out: &quot;The Indian diaspora of over 20 \nmillion around =\r\nthe world faces the acute problem that much of its \ncivilizational portraya=\r\nl has been controlled by outsiders for many \ncenturies. However, a sharp in=\r\ncrease in the prominence of Indians in \nthe global scene has forced a showd=\r\nown between the old guard&#39;s \nestablished ideas and the young, vibrant commu=\r\nnity. &quot;Invading the \nSacred&quot; is a first serious, albeit provocative, effort=\r\n to challenge \nthe parochial characterization of Hindus by western and/or \n=\r\nwesternized scholars. The book is path-breaking and takes to task \nthose sc=\r\nholars who have been falsely stereotyping Indian culture, and \nshows the im=\r\nportance of challenging such biases. It will hopefully \nlead to more balanc=\r\ned and respectful discourse, debate, and \ndiscussion on many issues facing =\r\nhumanity as a whole, for which Indic \ncivilization is an important resource=\r\n.&quot; \n\nTo the question as to why Indian scholars acquiesce to and even \nimita=\r\nte mistakes committed by Euro-American Indologists, in spite of \nthe fact t=\r\nhat they could and should know better, one academic says it \nis partly due =\r\nto India&#39;s colonization and a widespread overestimation \nof western culture=\r\n and the blind belief that anything of western or \nEuropean origin cannot b=\r\nut be superior to the corresponding element \nof Indic culture. The resultin=\r\ng &quot;inferiority complex&quot; has had a \nshattering and traumatic effect upon Ind=\r\nic scholarship and academic \noutput. Unfortunately, this trend continues ev=\r\nen in post-independent \nIndia and among Indians living in the diaspora toda=\r\ny, the authors of \nInvading the Sacred point out. \n\nThe irony is that this =\r\ndenigration of Hinduism is happening at a time \nwhen the widespread accepta=\r\nnce of many elements of Sanatana Dharma \nseems to point to a &quot;Hinduization&quot;=\r\n of the American cultural milieu. \n\nJust consider this. In 2005, roughly 18=\r\n million Americans are \npracticing Yoga. In multiple polls of American reli=\r\ngious beliefs and \nattitudes, up to 25% of Americans believe in reincarnati=\r\non. Tens of \nmillions of Americans meditate. Over 20 million are vegetarian=\r\n. \nAlmost half the population has turned to alternative health systems, \nsu=\r\nch as Ayurveda, herbal medicine and massage. \n\nWhat may be happening, at le=\r\nast according to one American Hindu Frank \nMorales, is that Americans are i=\r\nnterested in Yoga asanas, but are not \nas interested in become self-realize=\r\nd Yogis. They are interested in \nmeditation for its calming effects, but no=\r\nt necessarily as a means to \nachieve samadhi. Americans are keen to incorpo=\r\nrate Ayurvedic \nmedicine - but only as a complementary or alternative syste=\r\nm - mostly \nfor controlling obesity or for the rejuvenative aspect of \nPanc=\r\nhakarma. They are primarily interested in the many goodies that \nHinduism h=\r\nas to offer, but without taking the next logical step of \nbecoming Hindus, =\r\nor in many cases without even acknowledging the \npurely Hindu origins of th=\r\ne many practices that they have derived so \nmuch benefit from. \n\nMorales sa=\r\nys that while elements of Hinduism such as Yoga, ayurveda \nand meditation b=\r\necome more popular in America, Hinduism itself is in \ndanger of being assim=\r\nilated into the greater cultural milieu, just \nanother ingredient =96 albei=\r\nt a nicely spicy one =96 of the great \nAmerican melting-pot. &quot;We face the v=\r\nery real possibility of authentic \nSanatana Dharma becoming co-opted into t=\r\nhe greater American cultural \nmatrix as nothing more than a menagerie of di=\r\nsparate elements used to \nmarket New Age spirituality&quot; writes Morales in an=\r\n essay \nentitled `Does Hinduism Have a Future in America?&#39; \n\nAs a practicin=\r\ng Hindu, Morales is concerned about the \nacademic/media/education/governmen=\r\nt matrix in America that fosters \nanti-Hindu stereotypes. &quot;Rather than stan=\r\nding up and fighting against \nsuch anti-Hindu portrayals, the Hindu communi=\r\nty has been so slow to \nrespond to these attacks in the past that many of t=\r\nhe anti-Hindu \nbigots in academia feel they have a free reign to propagate =\r\nany lies \nabout Sanatana Dharma they wish. They also know that if the Hindu=\r\n \ncommunity ever even responds at all, it is usually too little, too \nlate,=\r\n and in a purely reactionary manner. We need to counter any and \nall attack=\r\ns against Sanatana Dharma immediately, forcefully and \nprofessionally.&quot; \n\nT=\r\nhis book is the first attempt at talking back to the academicians \nand is a=\r\n must read for all people of Indian origin, especially Hindu \nAmericans. As=\r\n one perceptive observer noted: &quot;in these jehadi times, \nwhen Islamists run=\r\n around the globe killing innocent people to prove \nthat their Prophet and =\r\ntheir book are the best, now and forever, the \nHindu idea becomes even more=\r\n relevant - What grander idea of faith \ncan there be than that everyone is =\r\nentitled to their own truth?&quot; \n\nThe contributors to the book, which is publ=\r\nished by Rupa, are Aditi \nBanerjee, Antonio T. de Nicolas, Alan Roland, Arv=\r\nind Sharma, S.N. \nBalagangadhara, Pandita Indrani Rampersad, Kalavai Venkat=\r\n, Krishnan \nRamaswamy, Vishal Agarwal, Ramesh N.
