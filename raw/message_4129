Would the mantra be w=\r\nritten in the Veda without the intended Sandhi applied?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha, on=\r\n your website your rendering is in agreement with what I thought was the tr=\r\nue mantra. Are the Sandhi rules to be applied between all words in Sanskrit=\r\n or are there exceptions?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I sincerely hope this is not too off topic.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Andri Lindbergs\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
