These two ri=\r\ntuals are really important and useful rituals.\n=A0\nA small comparison of ho=\r\nmam and tarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:\n=A0\n--=\r\n---------- --------- -----\nOne word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are =\r\ncalling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris =\r\nand the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespe=\r\nctive of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in =\r\ntheir horoscope.\n=A0\nIn homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking =\r\nkarmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from va=\r\nsanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. =\r\nIf you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry=\r\n or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having =\r\nthose thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the connecti=\r\non and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. You can f=\r\nree yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that ancestor.=\r\n If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new body, the thoughts an=\r\nd cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consciousness in the =\r\nsame way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, whil=\r\ne homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very important =\r\nsadhanas for spiritual progress.\n=A0\nDevatas are very subtle forms of consc=\r\niousness. Their self-identification is to what is known as soul and represe=\r\nnted by Sun. They work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas =\r\nit carries. Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachmen=\r\nts and desires. Their self-identification is with what is known as mind and=\r\n represented by Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with De=\r\nvas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the natur=\r\nal media for them respectively.\n=A0\nDevas and pitris have different ways of=\r\n working and influencing us and helping our spiritual progress. But both ar=\r\ne relevant to all of us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution.=\r\n Worshipping devas in fire and satisfying pitris in water are very importan=\r\nt.\n------------ --------- -----\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. =\r\nhome.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n--=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=A0=\r\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki10=\r\n8@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Thanks for this valuable manual. =\r\nCould you enlighten me on the difference between Pitri Tarpana and Shraddha=\r\nm?

In homam, you are ca=\r\nlling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris an=\r\nd the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespect=\r\nive of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in th=\r\neir horoscope.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In homam, devatas come in fire and burn your bl=\r\nocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you =\r\nfrom vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from=\r\n them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful o=\r\nr angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still =\r\nhaving those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the c=\r\nonnection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. Yo=\r\nu can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that an=\r\ncestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new\n body, the tho=\r\nughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consciousness=\r\n in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karm=\r\nas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very im=\r\nportant sadhanas for spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Devatas are very subt=\r\nle forms of consciousness. Their self-identification is to what is known as=\r\n soul and represented by Sun. They work on your individual soul and free it=\r\n from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness with=\r\n strong attachments and desires. Their self-identification is with what is =\r\nknown as mind and represented by Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are a=\r\nssociated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology. Fire and wa=\r\nter are the natural media for them respectively.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Devas and pit=\r\nris have different ways of working and influencing us and helping our spiri=\r\ntual progress. But both are relevant to all of us and\n have a role to play =\r\nin our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in fire and satisfying pitris=\r\n in water are very important.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;------------ --------- -----&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Nara=\r\nsimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.=\r\norg/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\nhomam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. =\r\nhome.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan=\r\n nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;---=\r\n In &lt;A rel=3Dnofollow&gt;JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Ramakrishnan Kris=\r\nhnamurthy &lt;ramki108@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks for this valuable manual. Could you enlighten me o=\r\nn the difference between Pitri Tarpana and Shraddham? I believe Shraddham i=\r\ns performed once a year on the thithi of demise of one&#39;s father (to be perf=\r\normed by the eldest son). There are some variants such as performing it dur=\r\ning the Shraddha Paksham instead of on the actual thithi, every year. Also,=\r\n have heard of a Gaya Shraddham, which is to be performed once in a lifetim=\r\ne, and which makes it unnecessary to perform yearly Shraddham subsequently.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Have tried to search for material on this but have=\r\n not succeeded so far. At least if you can provide information on some sour=\r\nces, it would be a great help.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks and regards,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Ram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On\n Fri, 12/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R.
