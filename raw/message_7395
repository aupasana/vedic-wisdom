I&#39;m guessing that most people either buy ghee, or melt i=\r\nt\non a stove. There is another option that I use -- a small crock pot.\n\nMat=\r\nerials:\n(a) Glass jar that will fit a standard 16oz block of butter e.g.\n&quot;P=\r\nresso Storage Jars, 2.5 liters&quot;.\n(b) A small crock pot that will fit the gl=\r\nass jar e.g. &quot;Little Dipper\nWarmer Crock Pot&quot;.\n(c) butter e.g. individually=\r\n wrapped 16 oz bricks.\n\n\nAll you have to do is unwrap 1 or 2 of the 16 oz b=\r\nricks of butter and\nput it in the glass jar. Put the jar in the crock pot a=\r\nnd cover it. In\nthe morning (i.e. 4-6 hours later), you&#39;ll have ghee with s=\r\nome curds\nat the bottom. You can carefully pour out the ghee into another v=\r\nessel\nand throw out the curds at the bottom with very little waste. There i=\r\ns\nno need for a strainer or anything else if you are careful.\n\nThe glass bo=\r\nttle and relatively low heat make it easy to clean up.\nSince the ghee has b=\r\neen slowly melted over a period of time, it\nretains the heat for much longe=\r\nr when compared to microwaving it. If\nyou have left over ghee, you can simp=\r\nly put it in any glass bottle\nthat will fit in the crock pot, and then reme=\r\nlt it overnight for the\nnext morning.\n\nThis is the simplest, cleanest, chea=\r\npest solution that I&#39;ve come\nacross.
