In China, he is known as the Loving or Frie=\r\nndly One. He is\nbased on an eccentric Chinese Ch&#39;an (Zen) monk who lived ov=\r\ner 1,000 years\nago and has become a significant part of Buddhist and Shinto=\r\n culture. Because\nof this monk&#39;s benevolent nature, he came to be regarded =\r\nas an incarnation\nof the bodhisattva who will be Maitreya (the Future Buddh=\r\na). His large\nprotruding stomach and jolly smile have given him the common =\r\ndesignation\n&quot;Laughing Buddha.&quot;\n\nHe was truly a great zen master and legend =\r\nhas a great story which is so\ninspirational for all of us.\n\nThe jolly good =\r\nsaint that he was used to go from one place to the other. He\nwent to the To=\r\nwn Square and soon people gathered around him. He was so funny\nlooking and =\r\nalways smiling that people used to crowd around him.\n\nHe would then distrib=\r\nute sweets and small toys to all children who had\ngathered around him. Then=\r\n keep his bag down, look to the sky and just start\nlaughing. He used to lau=\r\ngh madly and he was not interested whether other\nlaughed or not. Soon his l=\r\naughter used to be contagious and all who had\ngathered would start to laugh=\r\n.\n\nThe whole town used to laugh and laugh.After sometime he would pick the =\r\nbag,\nwhich he had kept down, smile to all, and go to the next town. All his=\r\n life\nhe did only this action and it was said that many people attained Nir=\r\nvana,\nenlightenment just through this process.Hence he was called as the la=\r\nughing\nBuddha because Buddha is someone who is enlightened and laughter was=\r\n his\nunique method. Never before him or never after him such a simple aspec=\r\nt was\nused to achieve what all humans strive for-moksha or enlightenment.\n\n=\r\nHe would rarely speak and once when he was asked to describe his method he\n=\r\ntold, that he gave sweets to children to symbolically that the more you\ngiv=\r\ne, the more comes to you. Thereby he unveiled the secret of &quot;Giving with\njo=\r\ny&quot;. Children are said to be GOD because they represent the GOD Nature,\nwhic=\r\nh is always, be in Present time, smiling and joyful, ego less, and most\nimp=\r\nortant is without judge mental mind.\n\nThe bag represented problems that all=\r\n humans encounter. We are mistaken that\nwhen we have problems, that GOD onl=\r\ny gave you a problem and the rest are so\nhappy. The problems appear big bec=\r\nause we are associated with it- calling it\nas &quot;My Problem&quot;. Look at a funny=\r\n phenomenon, if anyone comes to you with any\nproblem of theirs and seek sol=\r\nutions or advice, what you do. You tell them\nso many solutions so easily as=\r\n though you are an expert in all the fields in\nthe Universe. However big th=\r\ne others problems are you can solve it so\neasily, you are a master solver o=\r\nf problems. But then what happens to your\nown problems. Hmm Hmm it is impos=\r\nsible to find any solution.\n\nThis happens only because of your attachment a=\r\nnd association with the\nproblem.So laughing Buddha said, simple keep your p=\r\nroblem down (symbolically\nkeeping the bag down) means &quot;Disassociate with yo=\r\nur Problem&quot;, &quot;Separate form\nit&quot; and yes just Laugh. What else can one do? T=\r\nhink and thank GOD that you\nonly have such a small problem as compared to s=\r\no many others. Whether you\nlaugh or cry the problem is going to be there ri=\r\nght. So why not laugh at it.\nTherein is the magic and mind you no small mag=\r\nic, it is huge, apply it to\nrealize about the power of laughter.\n\nOn laughi=\r\nng your whole internal chemistry changes and thereby the body\nproduces cert=\r\nain enzymes that are only released in a state of laughter. The\nproblem now =\r\nlooks too tiny and as you pick it (symbolically he picks back\nthe bag befor=\r\ne going to the next place) the problem is solved.\n\nSuch a great zen master =\r\nwas Hotei or Laughing Buddha. So next time you look\nat the statue of &quot;laugh=\r\ning Buddha&quot; associate with that great teaching he\ngave all of us, the power=\r\n of laughter. Each time you see the Laughing Buddha\nand if it reminds you t=\r\no laugh, a great work has been done.\n\nWhole life Hotei lived in Laughter. A=\r\nnd when the time came to pass away, he\nknew he had to give up his life at a=\r\nn appropriate time. He called his\ndisciples and said that after he passes a=\r\nway, they should immediately burn\nhis body. The disciples were surprised be=\r\ncause there was no tradition of\nburning in Zen. But they followed the maste=\r\nr wishes. And as they lit fire to\nhis body, &quot;Fire Works and Crackers&quot; start=\r\ned flying all over.\n\nHotei was so great that just before he died he hid a l=\r\not of crackers and\nrockets in his clothes. So there also he created such la=\r\nughter by the\nsuddenness of the situation.So Hotei not only lived in laught=\r\ner all through\nhis life, he also died in laughter.\n\nLet us all learn from t=\r\nhe great zen master that &quot;It is our birth right to\nlaugh&quot; and &quot;No matter wh=\r\nat happens we should come back to laughter&quot;.\n\nSources:\n\n1)\nhttp://knol.goog=\r\nle.com/k/suresh-padmanabhan/the-secret-of-the-laughing-buddha/2nqmhj0tby0on=\r\n/5#\n\n2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd70f4a853a0604895b0f1d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nEvery one must have seen the statue of &quot;Laughing Buddha&quo=\r\nt;.He is also called as the &quot;Happy Man&quot;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In actuality he was named Hotei or Pu-Tai is best kno=\r\nwn as the jolly Laughing Buddha.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;In China, he is known as the Loving or Friendly One.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He is based on an eccentric Chinese Ch&#39;an (Ze=\r\nn) monk who lived over 1,000 years ago and has become a significant part of=\r\n Buddhist and Shinto culture.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Because of this monk&#39;s benevo=\r\nlent nature, he came to be regarded as an incarnation of the bodhisattva wh=\r\no will be Maitreya (the Future Buddha).
