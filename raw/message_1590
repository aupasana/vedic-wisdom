Theoritcal b=\r\nut relevant.\n=A0\nHe has given the idea of of terrorists. When a terrorist i=\r\ns doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his dharma. That is what he m=\r\naybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what his &quot;gurus&quot; may have ask=\r\ned him to do, and that is what his ideals/principles/books maybe asked of h=\r\nim to do. So from teh point of view of dharma, how can he be blamed? Theref=\r\nore, the statement taht &quot;Dharmo rakshati rakshitah..&quot;, does not make sense.=\r\n How is his dharma protecting him? What is he getting in return, other than=\r\n a bag load of strong karmas to fend off at a later date, when he may not e=\r\nven be aware why he has this karmas.\n=A0\nCan there is conflicting Dharmas f=\r\nor one person? Or more important vs=A0less important dharma? Swadharma shou=\r\nld be situational. Sant Tulsidas&#39;s=A0 broader dharma may have been realizin=\r\ng Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should have been to keep his wife happ=\r\ny. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can ever full perform every dharma that is =\r\nexpected of us. \n=A0\nI believe the reason this idea of Dharma was existent =\r\nin ancient times, was mostly because nature has created various kinds of pe=\r\nople, each with varying tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxi=\r\namtion, or the best way to tell men that we are all different and yet we ar=\r\ne not incorrect in anyway. This is much better than the new ages philosophi=\r\nes which outright deny reality and claim everything and everyone is born eq=\r\nual. It is not so.\n=A0\nThe word religion is a 13 century invention and, ety=\r\nmologically, and inherently competitive in nature. Unlike Dharma.\n=A0\nAlso,=\r\n as Narasimhaji&#39;s mail shows correctly, following Dharma is no gaurantee of=\r\n anything, least of all Moksha. It just continues the cycle. But what is th=\r\ne big deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way continue which ever p=\r\nath one choses, dharma or adharma. \n=A0\nA much better way of conduction lif=\r\ne, I feel, is maknig a mental note of Karma. To know teh simple truth that =\r\nthat which goes out will come back to you and that, if you had not been bad=\r\n at some point, nothing bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinar=\r\ny person, following a life based on and being on the right side of=A0karma,=\r\n is much easier and profitable=A0 than trying to find that elusive dharma w=\r\nhich anyway won&#39;t help one in the long run.\n=A0\nJust my feeling on the subj=\r\nect.\n=A0\n-Regards\n=A0Rajarshi\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\nMuch better option\n=A0\n\n\n=A0\n\nThe=\r\n upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Tue, 7/4/09, =\r\nNarasimha P.V.R.

Krishna clearly says in \n&gt; Bhagavad Ge=\r\neta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone \n&gt; else&#39;s dh=\r\narma&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the ri=\r\nght \n&gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to=\r\n time \n&gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects fr=\r\nom you, \n&gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what ac=\r\ntions you \n&gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, who you aff=\r\nected in the \n&gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, w=\r\nhat debts you \n&gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you acc=\r\numulated until \n&gt; now.\n&gt; \n&gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic=\r\n debts, nature wants a person \n&gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s d=\r\nharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \n&gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=\r\nts a person to spread the message of \n&gt; uniformity of all religions, that b=\r\necomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic deb=\r\nts, nature wants a person to spread the \n&gt; ritual of homam in the world, th=\r\nat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic=\r\n debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \n&gt; money and construct a tem=\r\nple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gu=\r\nrus, \n&gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too muc=\r\nh weight \n&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight.=\r\n Tremendous \n&gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to =\r\na great extent, \n&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna bei=\r\nng a great warrior, \n&gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he=\r\n deeply loved and \n&gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma=\r\n to kill them.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century=\r\n as one of \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been =\r\nArjuna in a \n&gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was di=\r\nfferent in this \n&gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material lif=\r\ne despite his \n&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk=\r\n and inspire \n&gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment a=\r\nnd service to \n&gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per wha=\r\nt Ramakrishna \n&gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be somet=\r\nhing else.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; The tr=\r\nicky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some peopl=\r\ne have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n&gt; and no=\r\nt someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept \n&gt; of =\r\ncaste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n&gt;=\r\n caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n&gt; k=\r\nilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a =\r\n\n&gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \n=\r\n&gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varn=\r\na \n&gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one=\r\n \n&gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know you=\r\nr \n&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharma=\r\ns in \n&gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing what one=\r\n&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; enough, one wil=\r\nl *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; mind that t=\r\nells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; noise from =\r\nother parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt; confused.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuiti=\r\non and \n&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, bu=\r\nt doing \n&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; \n&gt; More than following =\r\ndharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \n&gt; actions without ide=\r\nntification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \n&gt; accumulating new karma=\r\ns, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \n&gt; too much attachment=\r\n to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n&gt; possible actions (ba=\r\nsed on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \n&gt; situation is), =\r\nwith as little attachment and self-identification with the \n&gt; action as pos=\r\nsible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result \n&gt; to god. W=\r\ne should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; work&quot; et=\r\nc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; unattached =\r\naction) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \n&gt; As we=\r\n become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n&gt; T=\r\nhere is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n&gt; =\r\ndharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy=\r\n, \n&gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline is: Even if =\r\none is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; ge=\r\nts refined with time if one engages in action with \n&gt; little attachment.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s d=\r\nharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt; Another external in=\r\nput is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n&gt; derive one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; master. If on=\r\ne surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \n&gt; the master=\r\n to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Arjuna was co=\r\nnfused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt; and relatives=\r\n was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; dharma. When=\r\n Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; and want=\r\ned to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt; =\r\nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is not in tune with n=\r\nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; debts are and what nature=\r\n expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n&gt; one&#39;s inner core,=\r\n such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a s=\r\net of principles and \n&gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from=\r\n person to person, from \n&gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, ther=\r\ne are no thumbrules to find \n&gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refin=\r\ne one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n&gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By =\r\ndoing various kinds of spiritual \n&gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and eng=\r\naging in actions without much \n&gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself =\r\nand refine one&#39;s understanding of \n&gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ t=\r\narpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -=\r\n---- \n&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora=\r\n series\n&gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very =\r\npersonal.\n&gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n&gt;&gt; to=\r\nwards it\n&gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; reg=\r\nards\n&gt;&gt; jitender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      From Chandigarh to Chennai - find fr=\r\niends all over India.

Krishna cle=\r\narly says in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangero=\r\nus to follow someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Following th=\r\ne path of dharma basically means engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;&gt; action/duty=\r\n. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and=\r\n from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions =\r\nyou &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, who you aff=\r\nected in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified w=\r\nith, what debts you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; created in the process, and what mental tenden=\r\ncies you accumulated until &lt;BR&gt;&gt; now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If, based on one&#39;=\r\ns mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to kil=\r\nl\n evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the messag=\r\ne of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, b=\r\nased on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a p=\r\nerson to spread the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one=\r\n&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, =\r\nnature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; money and construct a templ=\r\ne, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gur=\r\nus, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was to=\r\no much weight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved\n of =\r\nsome weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; destruction was to take place and civiliza=\r\ntion destroyed to a great extent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the=\r\n tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it was his dharma to f=\r\nacilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; respected were on =\r\nthe other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When th=\r\ne same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite=\r\n his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk an=\r\nd inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachmen=\r\nt and service to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, a=\r\ns per what Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; said), his dharma based on the\n time and pl=\r\nace may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your o=\r\nwn dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. =\r\nThough the concept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for=\r\n a long time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; caste mobility was very much there. V=\r\nalmiki was a shudra who lived by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; killing birds. He became a brahma=\r\nna and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kshatrita and a powerfu=\r\nl king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; later. Basically v=\r\narna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of father=\r\n, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; deve=\r\nlops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one\n does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to kno=\r\nw your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not ju=\r\nst 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If o=\r\nne is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of u=\r\ns have a part of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it=\r\n is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; noise from other parts of our minds whi=\r\nch tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; confused.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We s=\r\nhould make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but do=\r\ning &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; More t=\r\nhan following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n actions without identification. *That* alone\n ensures that we are not &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not b=\r\nuild &lt;BR&gt;&gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in=\r\n the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our=\r\n dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;&gt; situation is), with as little attachment and =\r\nself-identification with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; action as possible. When the action i=\r\ns finished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to god. We should not think=\r\n &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; work&quot; etc. Such adhe=\r\nrence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unattached action=\r\n) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we=\r\n become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see o=\r\nur &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This=\r\n is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but not as\n difficult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sen=\r\nse of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in=\r\n action with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are =\r\nthe inputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and =\r\nlearned men. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special plac=\r\ne is given to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiri=\r\ntual master, one can take the words of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the master to determine one=\r\n&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When Arjuna was confuse=\r\nd about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and relative=\r\ns was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharm=\r\na. When Narendranath (Swami\n Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sad=\r\nhana, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay=\r\n in the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, w=\r\nhat one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in th=\r\ne judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated s=\r\noul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can gi=\r\nve perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Botto=\r\nmline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, fro=\r\nm &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbru=\r\nles to find &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s u=\r\nnderstanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doi=\r\nng various kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and =\r\nengaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; attachment, one can slowly purify=\r\n oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s individual dharma=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish\n lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastr=\r\no.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home=\r\n.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Sri=\r\nJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/c=\r\nompose?to=3Ddahiyajiten@...&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:dahiyajiten@...&quot;&gt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.\n com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nDharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; i just f=\r\ninished my Aghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Vim=\r\nalanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Can somebody share=\r\n views on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; D=\r\noes it has to do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; jitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;=\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--6--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Add more friends to your mess=\r\nenger and enjoy! &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_6/*htt=\r\np://messenger.yahoo.com/invite/&quot;&gt; Invite them now.&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-1436224994-1239081697=:13342--\r\n\n"}}
