And=\r\n for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of Sanatan Dharma.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about him initially. =\r\na year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i switched on TV where =\r\nin i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of a gat=\r\nhering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his lecture. Th=\r\ne reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christianity for p=\r\nroving his points. Immediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and=\r\n &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus)  come f=\r\nor discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in they have attack=\r\ned any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of Sanatan Dha=\r\nrma. there is such an obvious contrast.\n&gt; &gt; after that first lecture, i wat=\r\nched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced that this person is not a tru=\r\ne spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a fanatic=\r\n and then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debate at t=\r\nhe same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated on =\r\nthe issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking him th=\r\nat does he really believe that other religions and faith are also true. I m=\r\nust say that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more tolerance an=\r\nd understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; The unfortunate part is that the br=\r\noad minded people of today&#39;s generations are getting corrupted by such fana=\r\ntic leaders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Rea=\r\nlly good friends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -&quot;The time h=\r\nas come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious faiths but also=\r\n we must belive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is true an=\r\nd we must never try to convert people of other religion to our religion but=\r\n on the contrary we must discourage a person who wants to formally convert =\r\nby telling him/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to such theatr=\r\nics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as=\r\n many opinion are there&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i belie=\r\nve him as a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes =\r\nme believe that. Now that is the reason i wish to know his views on this pa=\r\nrticular debate episode. I know he has a great knowledge and he also is a s=\r\ncholar but then why he did not counter Dr. Zakir?. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Siva wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; [\n&gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silver jubilee with over 2 million people meditati=\r\nng and doing Sudarshan Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006.

Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n   I was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was still at m=\r\ny mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in Sahaja=\r\n Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things should =\r\nbe. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest=\r\n order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura inste=\r\nad of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself years later wou=\r\nld advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a satisfying=\r\n intellectual answer to it if people raise questions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Auro=\r\nbindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: If Kris=\r\nhna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in itself=\r\n! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more co=\r\nmplete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the ori=\r\nginal to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another ins=\r\ntance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi a=\r\nnd made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanim=\r\nity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can intellectu=\r\nally argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram and inmates from th=\r\ne thieves. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, there were certain things that I did not =\r\nwant to put in an public email. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silverjubile=\r\ne with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya together h=\r\nappened around Feb 16, 2006.

Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained l=\r\nogically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty ab=\r\nout an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contai=\r\nn them in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much=\r\n higher.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the Mother would say if something is beyond our me=\r\nntal understanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I ha=\r\nve said everything I had to say. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In hind sight, I realize tha=\r\nt I should not have ventured to give an intellectual explanation for someth=\r\ning that I myself have not yet intellectually understood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I di=\r\nd want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what do say=\r\n or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledge or unde=\r\nrstanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri Krishna m=\r\night judge him differently for several of His acts which could not be intel=\r\nlectually explained.

In fact, this is a question that was raised by disciples of=\r\n Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if one looks into it, one =\r\nwill be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has commente=\r\nd exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an authority on vedanta both b=\r\ny his inner Realization and learning, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he=\r\n was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and who gives impromptu disc=\r\nourses in various forums across the world on all topics under the sun shy a=\r\nway from explaining some simple questions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debat=\r\nes on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show th=\r\ne way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested=\r\n in anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart of =\r\nthe questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and let it pass, h=\r\nowever big the occasion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in t=\r\nhat meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentarie=\r\ns & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he g=\r\no to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was somethin=\r\ng like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to=\r\n the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly t=\r\nhe topic of discussion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from the a=\r\nudience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to eve=\r\nryone, especially those among us that are intellectually curious about spir=\r\nituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices=\r\n &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometime=\r\ns in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri=\r\n will only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, bu=\r\nt his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are re=\r\nceptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading o=\r\nne mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to=\r\n Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Wo=\r\nrds are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of wor=\r\nds is to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, t=\r\nhere is no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great privilege =\r\nand an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it=\r\n is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from ou=\r\nr Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerab=\r\nle examples of very simple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence=\r\n while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of =\r\na lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna =\r\nwould feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What =\r\na disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakris=\r\nhna as an illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without an accompa=\r\nnying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an experie=\r\nnce) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet ano=\r\nther mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of=\r\n the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none =\r\nother than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like=\r\n lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way less=\r\n dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasionally v=\r\nisit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the below e=\r\nmail from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual p=\r\nractices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to cl=\r\narify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit=\r\n-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc=\r\n. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not ma=\r\nke it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would c=\r\nall it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge in=\r\nto SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and t=\r\nhe sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, =\r\nBhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not jus=\r\nt doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranaya=\r\nms and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind and =\r\npreparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of contemplati=\r\non, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice of Su=\r\ndarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequ=\r\nence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) ta=\r\nught in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan=\r\n Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advanc=\r\ne courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Nar=\r\nada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita=\r\n. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the abo=\r\nve. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly=\r\n available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besi=\r\ndes daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Lea=\r\nrning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive t=\r\no become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of A=\r\nOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sank=\r\neertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder =\r\nabout lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let m=\r\ne clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully =\r\nEnlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guid=\r\ning millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to be =\r\nnear them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had=\r\n that experience twice), some in person and several via various other ways.=\r\n However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is ess=\r\nential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and =\r\nin-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to guide di=\r\nsciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be establi=\r\nshed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (most=\r\nly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order capable of reaching Sa=\r\ntChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. They may be not fully =\r\nestablished in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru and can =\r\nappropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achieved hi=\r\nghest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Mahari=\r\nshi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are in physical=\r\n form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its co=\r\nurses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teach=\r\ners nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proc=\r\needs go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the f=\r\null time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth i=\r\nn property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neith=\r\ner needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went=\r\n through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Know=\r\nledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be =\r\nrevealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior A=\r\nOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help or g=\r\nuidance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir=\r\n, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divin=\r\ne Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money =\r\nis charged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) =\r\nPast experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow =\r\nthe practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving p=\r\nerson should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a vol=\r\nunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand ma=\r\nny cases where people took courses for free and were also provided free acc=\r\nommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there p=\r\naying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provid=\r\ne healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl positio=\r\nn. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still =\r\nmay have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri S=\r\nri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express the love=\r\n, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a path=\r\n, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
