Such a being is of no help, and should not be worshipped.=\r\n The actualy Mahakali, Aurobindo says, is splendid golden in color as he sa=\r\nw it.

But what powe=\r\nr does that mass of emotion have? In my view nothing. Neither good not bad.=\r\n Now say another person comes infornt of the idol and bows down and says a =\r\nprayer to Kali, where is that going to reach? I believe - logically - it sh=\r\nould reach=A0the real Kali wherever She maybe and idol will, even though it=\r\n has negative emtions=A0lodged in it,=A0will only play the part of symbol t=\r\nhat makes one remember Kaali. \n=A0\nThis is how I look at it logically.
