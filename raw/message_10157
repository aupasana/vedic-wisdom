In some procedures, the\n focus is not on the abhisheka, and the r=\r\nudram / chamakam are\n not recited. The bodhayana shesha sutras (for those w=\r\nho\n learn the krishna yajur veda) have a procedure for the daily\n worship o=\r\nf rudra (mahAdevasya aharahaH paricaryAvidhiH).\n Here, in the abhisheka por=\r\ntion, the main mantras recited are\n the &quot;hiranyavarniiyaa&quot; and &quot;pavamaana&quot;\n=\r\n suktas. The most common procedure for rudrAbhisheka includes\n the laghunya=\r\nsa, followed by abhisheka with the rudra and\n chamaka mantras.=C2=A0\n \n \n N=\r\narasimha has included the standard\n &quot;shodashopachara puja&quot; in his homam man=\r\nuals. You\n can just follow this. If you want to use more flowers, then\n you=\r\n can offer 108 or 1008 flowers (with the same mantra, or\n while chanting 10=\r\n8 / 1008 names) before saying &quot;puShpam\n samarpayAmi&quot;. If you want to do a l=\r\nonger abhisheka,\n then you can repeat the mantra of your choice before sayi=\r\nng\n &quot;snAnam samarpayAmi&quot;. No particular mantra is\n required .... re-read po=\r\nint #3 from Narasimha&#39;s reply\n below.\n \n \n Generally speaking, it is reason=\r\nable to expect\n trained priests who follow the krishna yajur veda to recite=\r\n\n both the rudra and chamaka. However, the rudra prashna is\n the more impor=\r\ntant of the two. This is why we repeat only\n the rudra portion many times (=\r\n11, 121 etc) when we do a more\n elaborate version of the rudrabhisheka. An =\r\neven simpler way\n is to recite the &quot;rudra sukta&quot; which has only 6\n mantras,=\r\n most of which are from the rudra prashna. Or,\n simply recite the mrityunja=\r\nya mantra or the panchakshari.\n There are many options.\n \n \n sasneham,\n =C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 ajit\n \n \n \n On Tue, Feb 25, 2014\n at 10:40 AM, amit kumar agrawa=\r\nl &lt;amitagrawal_mca@...&gt;\n wrote:\n \n \n Dear\n Group Members,\n \n \n \n No=\r\nw a days, the priests are not learned enough to properly\n perform rudrabhis=\r\nheka.
