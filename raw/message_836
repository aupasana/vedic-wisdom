Rao \n&gt; &lt;pvr@&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is quite relevant and not at all inappropriate. Let me give =\r\n\n&gt; the crux\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the philosophy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place to another \n&gt; very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n rapidly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and gives varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadne=\r\nss \n&gt; etc. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable=\r\n, one can experience \n&gt; the bliss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finding the true Self. The=\r\n goal of all spiritual sadhana - \n&gt; japam, homam,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dhyanam, contemplat=\r\nion and various rituals - is to enable the \n&gt; mind to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ca=\r\nlm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At first, one cannot make the mind stable and calm. All one=\r\n can \n&gt; do it to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tie\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra)=\r\n. The monkey still \n&gt; moves around,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but its motion is restricted. Onc=\r\ne it goes far, the thread tying \n&gt; it to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pole stops it from going=\r\n further away. Similarly, when one tries \n&gt; to focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a mantr=\r\na and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one constantly \n&gt; brings it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n back to the mantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries \n=\r\n&gt; to become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calm and stable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After trying enough, just as=\r\n monkey tied to a pole may stop \n&gt; jumping around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and fall asleep hol=\r\nding on to the pole, the mind may stop \n&gt; thinking of so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many things =\r\nand become absolutely calm and stable while \n&gt; repeating a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; When all the thoughts cease and some level of silence comes to \n&gt; the m=\r\nind,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences some level of bliss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by the \n&gt;=\r\n mind to aid\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind to stop wandering from one thing to another t=\r\nhing. The goal \n&gt; is to give\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an anchor for the mind to focus on=\r\n, instead of jumping \n&gt; everywhere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Various sound combinations =\r\ncan be used for this purpose. For \n&gt; example, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can even repeat &quot;I =\r\nwant to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every \n&gt; combination of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sou=\r\nnds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating it \n&gt; enough. Sound\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; patterns making sense in various languages were used by some \n&gt; saint=\r\ns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; messiahs from time to time in the past to obtain bliss and thos=\r\ne \n&gt; sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; patterns are revered as being sacred in various religions.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Compared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are =\r\n\n&gt; easier to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24 =\r\n\n&gt; letters/syllables,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; part of the mind is responsible for cha=\r\nnging from one letter to \n&gt; another and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is more mind acti=\r\nvity even in a state of high mental focus \n&gt; on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. If you re=\r\npeat a single syllable constantly, the task is \n&gt; simpler for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe mind and it is easier for the mind to shut down various \n&gt; tasks of the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind and become close to being still and silent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Various =\r\nsyllables can be used for this purpose. These syllables \n&gt; are called\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n beeja aksharas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Beeja means a seed. Beeja ak=\r\nshara means a seed syllable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When mind has absolutely no activi=\r\nty and becomes completely \n&gt; still (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ceases to exist!), one reali=\r\nzes the true Self (Aatman or \n&gt; Brahman). When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has very li=\r\nttle activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still \n&gt; exists, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a very high state of focus and calmness), one realizes different \n&gt; p=\r\nure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manifestations of cosmic being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one meditates on=\r\n a beeja akshara and attains the above \n&gt; state of high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental focus =\r\nand calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thoughts other than \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; repetition=\r\n of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a seed \n&gt; corresponding to a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity. The energy of that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness when \n&gt; one=\r\n&#39;s mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; filled with that syllable and has no other thoughts =\r\nin it. In \n&gt; other words,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; each deity is a personifications of the sta=\r\nte of a mind that is \n&gt; focused on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sound of a specific beeja with=\r\n no other thoughts in it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, if one&#39;s=\r\n mind has many thoughts while repeating a \n&gt; beeja akshara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (or any ma=\r\nntra in general), one may experience a lot of emotions \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still and calm with no \n&gt; though=\r\nt in it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (other than what is needed for repeating that sound), we can =\r\nsay \n&gt; that one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual ego has been replaced with that of=\r\n a deity and the \n&gt; deity has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; filled one&#39;s mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, fo=\r\ncused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one \n&gt; experience the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; en=\r\nergy of a deity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which syllables make one exp=\r\nerience which energy was well-\n&gt; understood and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; catalogued by ancient=\r\n Hindu sages nicely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many mantras other than beeja aksharas wer=\r\ne also experiemented \n&gt; by rishis,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who understood the nature of energ=\r\ny experienced by one&#39;s mind \n&gt; when one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is completely filled w=\r\nith the sound of the mantra and all \n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts leave the mind.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So we need not experiment newly. We can use the knowledge \n&gt; d=\r\niscovered by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rishis and go further.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is my first time posting on the vedic-wisdom g=\r\nroup.
