I see that your signature changed after the trip.\n=A0\nWe =\r\nhad a remarkable time at Varanasi. \n=A0\nThe moment our flight landed at the=\r\n Kashi airport which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Mani=\r\nsh said there is something in here which is different. The energy is palpab=\r\nle throughout. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming =\r\naround the ghats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n=A0\nBy 9 P=\r\nM Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan,=\r\n on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many grea=\r\nt sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to pe=\r\nrform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=\r\n=A0spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=A0The =\r\neffect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for =\r\nthose who have such inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire=\r\n of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike t=\r\nhe fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and man=\r\ny in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not=\r\n to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a fune=\r\nral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not trying anything in =\r\nsuch a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are Mahakala and\n Mahakal=\r\ni. \n=A0\n=A0We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of=\r\n=A0full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =A0kismis, havan samag=\r\nri. While buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath =\r\ntemple, suddenly a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There =\r\nwas a sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop aski=\r\nng for food. Manish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the chil=\r\nd. The child was eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we =\r\nwere buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child=\r\n, I turned round and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was=\r\n no child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very cl=\r\nearly. Manish smiled and said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whet=\r\nher we=A0had become so big sadhakas that we=A0are unable to feed a hungry c=\r\nhild=A0. That is how God comes to test people.=A0Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha=\r\n aur=A0kis\n roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n=A0\nAt 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed=\r\n in a combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the =\r\nsamshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people=\r\n who work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at l=\r\neast 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges,=\r\n pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease ou=\r\nt a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to=\r\n react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of=\r\n curiosity=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes=\r\n and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous en=\r\nergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi=\r\n. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too tu=\r\nrned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs i=\r\nn the samshan went running=A0to\n that direction.\n=A0\nAfter waiting like thi=\r\ns for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major=\r\n portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some=\r\n time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offer=\r\ning was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sy=\r\nnc with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to =\r\nthe ambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were up=\r\nto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre =\r\nto light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, takin=\r\ng pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to h=\r\nim not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb =\r\nthat pyre again. \n=A0\nVery soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack =\r\nof 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was=\r\n being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, f=\r\nrom all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it=\r\n tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching =\r\nus or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Ver=\r\ny nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron=\r\n and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind a=\r\nway to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally=A0a=\r\nccustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from the pa=\r\nck which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish=\r\n. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in an an=\r\ngular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not an ani=\r\nmal but a human being\n watching. Just staring and observing every action. M=\r\nanish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.\n=A0\nThe hom=\r\na finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well as in be=\r\ntween, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few notches abo=\r\nve the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n=A0\nSimply being in a samshan=\r\n and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind.=\r\n In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Bo=\r\nth the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this k=\r\nind of a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very=\r\n sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling=\r\n of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more rea=\r\nl and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish =\r\nas they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.\n=A0\nManish said if yo=\r\nur intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through =\r\nsadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of pe=\r\ntty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to =\r\nharm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb y=\r\nou because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi. I=\r\nt is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. There =\r\nare spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they bo=\r\nther you. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=A0attitude to have. And=\r\n finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa is being done, =\r\nis taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.\n=A0\nThus ended my firs=\r\nt experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Sapt=\r\nami. The next two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik. \n=A0\n-Regards\n=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n=A0\n...to be continued...\n=A0\nRama Naama Satya Hai..\n\n\n      Th=\r\ne INTERNET now has a personality.
