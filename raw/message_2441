In South India, Sraddha is observed as above. This is known as Pratyaabdika Sraddham. It calls for  certain voluntary restrictions and sacrifices on the part of the  karta and  elaborate rituals with Homam and offering of  Vastra, Bhojanam ( as per family tradition)  and  decent Dakshina  to the Brahmins who officiate as pitr and visvedeva apart from appropriate  Dakshina to the family or other priest who conducts the Shraddha proceedings. Pitr Paksha Sraddha  involves offerings also to Karunika Pitrs  i.e., relatives who died and for whom there were no issues or for whom there is none  willing to perform Shraddha  rites. Pitr Paksha Sraddha  is far simpler and less\n time consuming as compared to annual  Sraddha  referred to above. In Pitr Paksha Sraddhas  normally 5  Brahmins  of  which one has to be a priest are required.  One of the brahmins is nominated as  Karunika Pitr.  In place of meals as in  Pratyaabdika Sraddham , in  Pitr Paksha Sraddhams they are offered rice,dal  and some vegetable like raw  plantain and any other thing as per custom. In USA and other offshore lands, very few freelance  priests are available as in India. It is also difficult to get more than one priest at a time, at places where they are available, since most of the priests are working for Hindu temples. But the temples allow the priest for house visit or for performing rituals in the temple complex itself. There are prescribed scales of fees for various rituals to be paid to the temple. Over and above this one cay pay any gratis amout to the priest. The list of items to be given as danam  to the priest included milk, curd,ghee,3\n varieties of fruits and 2,3 varieties of vegetables in addition to those listed above.\n\nComing to the question as to what can be done if one is located at a place where no priests are available, one should do at leastPitr tarpanam, if one is accustomed to performing   Tarpanams on Amavasya, Sankramanams, Grahana kalams  and all other  Punyakalams.Essential requirements for Tarpanam are Yagnopaveetham, Dharbha Grass,Black til (2,3 grams) and a rice(2 grams).  If one is not performing these prescribed(ordained) rites, he needs to seek  kshama from  Pitrus on that day for non-performance  and at the earliest possible occasions contact a Guru or Purohit and seek  advice on remedial actions. It is permissible to perform  Shraddha  on some other occasion. Pl. consult the  Purohit in this regard.  My suggestion is at least feed poor people or Brahmins on the day of  Shraddha.   Unquestionable faith (shraddha)  is a must in such ceremonies. Do not give Dakshina to priest grudgingly. Have faith and belief that the pitrs  get pleased by doing the\n prescribed rites.\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Shankerprasad Bhatt &lt;ssbhatt79@...&gt;\nTo: USBrahmins@yahoogroups.com\nCc: gita-talk@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, September 2, 2009 12:43:16 PM\nSubject: [USBrahmins] Fwd: [Shakti-L: 10093] Shortage of priests affects annual Pitra Paksh  rituals\n\n  \nShraddha Paksha is started  from this Saturday and we are required to\noffer prayers for the salvation of our family members.When priests are\nnot available all Hindus ought to recite prayers for the liberation of\nour mother father and other relatives.Besides we ought to recite Bhagv\nata Gita and Vishnu Sahastra Nama and do some kirtans by remembering\nthem.Go to the temple and offer donations to the temples and its\npriests\nI will be sending article on Shraddha ceremony\n\nS S Bhatt\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: sri venkat &lt;ahvenkitesh@ gmail.com&gt;\nDate: Wed, Sep 2, 2009 at 2:51 AM\nSubject: [Shakti-L: 10093] Shortage of priests affects annual Pitra\nPaksh rituals\nTo:\n\nShortage of priests affects Hindu rites\n\nhttp://www.newkeral a.com/nkfullnews -1-103622. html\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-2003638375-1252029280=:26878\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;----- Forwarded Message ----&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; USBrahmins@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, September 3, 2009 9:46:08 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [USBrahmins] Fwd: [Shakti-L: 10093] Shortage of priests affects annual Pitra Paksh  rituals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;br&gt;For general information I would like to submit that&nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; Shraddha&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; is required &nbsp; to be performed not only&nbsp; during&nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pitr Paksha&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;but also on the respective anniversary &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Thithi&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;in the respective anniversary &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Paksha and respective&nbsp;&nbsp; anniversary month of one`s father and mother,if&nbsp; they are not alive.&lt;/span&gt; In South India, Sraddha is observed as above.
