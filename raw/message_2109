It has been observed that if you place coconut pieces where =\r\nwhite portion remains up (pieces rest on dark side) then there are all the =\r\nchances that pieces may not burnt fully. this is my personal experience. so=\r\n i can suggest few things as under:\n\n- Keep Dark side up\n- Keep the pieces =\r\nsuch that they don&#39;t pile on each other.\n- Keep the pieces such a way that =\r\nit forms a pyramid shape (top of that shape is opened so that Aahuti can be=\r\n offered conveniently in that. i mean, there should be a scope for air to p=\r\nass under the pieces.\n\nIt is my experience that coconut peices do get burnt=\r\n completely.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;n=\r\naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1)While do=\r\ning homam can we move the coconut pieces that are there in the havan kund, =\r\nso that they get burned easily.\n&gt; &gt; i asked it becoz would it be right to p=\r\noke in the fire with a stick while we are actually assuming Ganpati is in t=\r\nhat fire and the idol at that time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. You can move the coconut=\r\n pieces anywhere to facilitate their burning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)Almost every time so=\r\nme pieces are left  unburnt, so i do not remove the remains from the kund a=\r\nnd next time use it as it is and add fresh pieces of coconut.Is it fine??\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Yes.
