I agree that it just &quot;Is&quot;, and\nthat the extrapolation o=\r\nf &quot;doing&quot; is only a figment of our minds and egos in\norder to try and under=\r\nstand it. The funny thing is, though, that only\nconsciousness can understan=\r\nd consciousness. All we can do is invent\nlanguages and stumble around tryin=\r\ng to square &quot;it&quot; in our organic brains.\n\nHowever, the universe really is, o=\r\nn a level of actuality, unreal.

There is no such thing as\n&quot;solid&quot; material, the closest this =\r\nuniverse gets to solidity (and hence\n&quot;realness&quot;) is a black hole, which is =\r\nso out of place that it rips apart the\nfabric of space and time, so that no=\r\nt even light, a massless particle (a\nparadox if there ever was one) can esc=\r\nape its grasp. Similarly, though on a\ndifferent level of course, the Ego tr=\r\nies to find and create solidity on\nearth which draws Chaos to it, which req=\r\nuires further constructions of\nsolidity (&quot;beliefs&quot;) to bolster it. The only=\r\n thing that allows the\nappearance of &quot;things&quot; as &quot;separate&quot; from other &quot;thi=\r\nngs&quot;, is electromagnetic\nenergy, or shakti, in her symbolic form as Maya.\n\n=\r\nIndia (Bharat) has come up with many scientific ideas that form the basis\n(=\r\nfoundation) of Western science. *And they did it through meditation on\nCons=\r\nciousness*.\n\n=E2=80=9CWe owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to cou=\r\nnt, without which no\nworthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.=\r\n=E2=80=9D - Albert Einstein\n\nCarl Sagan:\n&quot;The tenth episode of COSMOS is la=\r\nrgely about cosmology - the study of the\nuniverse in a perspective in which=\r\n the Earth is like a grain to stand in\nvast beach or desert - and the way w=\r\ne approach the subject is through Hindu\ncosmology. ... But the main reason =\r\nthat we oriented this episode of COSMOS\ntowards India is because of that wo=\r\nnderful aspect of Hindu cosmology which\nfirst of all gives a time-scale for=\r\n the Earth and the universe -- a\ntime-scale which is consonant with that of=\r\n modern scientific cosmology. ...\nAs far as I know. It is the only ancient =\r\nreligious tradition on the Earth\nwhich talks about the right time-scale.&quot;\n\n=\r\nFew are the scientists that are brave enough to stand up and grant Bharat\nh=\r\ner rightful inheritance, because they suffer from their own cultural\nxenoph=\r\nobia and religious bigotry, but that is a whole different subject....\n\nIt i=\r\ns possibly only an assumption that the universe is a construction of\nConsci=\r\nousness, however, Consciousness is one of the only &quot;things&quot;, if not\nthe *on=\r\nly* thing, that can never be &quot;this&quot;. Take away everything that is\n&quot;This&quot;, a=\r\nnd the only thing left is &quot;That&quot;. It&#39;s sort of how 2 hydrogen\nmolecules ele=\r\nctromagnetically bond with one oxygen molecule, and &quot;Live&quot; as\nwhat we human=\r\ns have labeled &quot;Water&quot;. There is no such thing as &quot;water&quot;, per\nse, there ar=\r\ne only electrons, protons, and neutrons -etc.- bumping around in\na vast sea=\r\n of Chaos, the substratum, what we call Brahma.\n\nBy the way, I am a Caucasi=\r\nan, American by birth, who considered himself an\natheist for many years (I =\r\npresently live in India and am Hindu). When I\ndiscovered the greatness of t=\r\nhe Rishis, the Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I\nrealized how much *more* splendid=\r\n this planet could be with the Sanatana\nDharma respected for the greatness,=\r\n beauty, and Truth it holds and bestows\nupon us, who are also That (Conscio=\r\nusness is not divided as the Upanishad\nstates &#39;take the full from the full,=\r\n and the full remains.&#39; I don&#39;t offhand\nrecall the attribution.)\n\n\n     I&#39;m=\r\n just questioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita\n\n\nThey are also &quot;ass=\r\numptions&quot; that have been laboratory tested in the halls of\nscience and prov=\r\nen sound.\n\n\n    which seem to be totally opposite of what  Bhagavad Gita is=\r\n saying. In\nfact what you are saying leads to nihilism which is what Buddhi=\r\nsts say. If\nyou agree that you believe in Buddhism we can move on. But if y=\r\nou say all\nwhat you are saying is in Vedas , then I will question.\n\n\nNihili=\r\nsm is an attitude of defeatism. It is not an attitude of respectful\nworship=\r\n towards this great mystery that we call the universe, the cosmos,\nwhich we=\r\n are a part of; and Life itself, which animates us and all other\nliving thi=\r\nngs.\n\nI consider every &quot;thing&quot; as &quot;alive&quot;. The main difference in us is tha=\r\nt we\nhave a brain which allows us access to levels of Understanding not pos=\r\nsible\nwithout a complex symbolic language. There is no difference between m=\r\ne, you,\na drop of water, a worm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance due to=\r\n Maya.\n\nI have a Mithuna Lagna (which should be obvious!) so I tend to thin=\r\nk of\nthings on an intellectual level. However, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati (diffe=\r\nrent\nfacets of shakti) makes it easy for my human mind to grasp the Dance o=\r\nf Life\nand Existence, and I stand in awe before this great tapestry of Brah=\r\nman&#39;s\ndream.\n\nWhile I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspect of the =\r\nuniverse (the\nCreative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and grants it an all-e=\r\nncompassing\npower over all that is. A Shivaite would say that the Destructi=\r\nve aspect\n(entropy) is actually the engine of life, and hence Shiva is the =\r\nGod of\nGods. A Shakta would say that since Shakti is responsible for the ap=\r\npearance\nof apparent reality, then She is the God of Gods.\n\nI say only that=\r\n Thou Art That, there is no Other. And this draw towards one\nForm of Divini=\r\nty or another, or the Advaitin draw towards the Formless\nDivine, is based o=\r\nn, i.e. has its foundation in, one&#39;s Karma. And hence\none&#39;s Karma *does* dr=\r\nive one on, like a chariot driver. The BG contains\nmany, many wonderful Tru=\r\nths.\n\n\n    PS : I&#39;m not a Dvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I do not want to st=\r\nart\nanother Dvaita v/s Advaita thread on this forum.There have been many su=\r\nch\nthreads going on on the internet without any value.  I just want more so=\r\nlid\nexplanation if what you wrote is indeed true.\n\n\n\n\nOne does not have to =\r\ndeclare oneself a dualist in order to be one, one\nmerely divides the &quot;spiri=\r\ntual realm&quot; as something different and outside of\nthe material.

Matter and energy\nbecame\n    &gt; intercha=\r\nngeable.\n    &gt; Max Planck, famous for his quantum theory, added a further d=\r\nimension\nto\n    &gt; this, stating that it is consciousness that is fundamenta=\r\nl and that\nmatter\n    &gt; is a derivative of consciousness. As a corollary ev=\r\nen space and time\nare\n    &gt; only concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scie=\r\nntists are veering\nround to\n    &gt; the conclusion that since every object is=\r\n a sum of its qualities and\nthese\n    &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the =\r\nwhole objective universe of matter\nand\n    &gt; energy, atoms and stars does n=\r\not exist except as a construction of\n    &gt; consciousness.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; Yoga =\r\nVashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere are experienced\nby us;\n   =\r\n &gt; there is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;\n  =\r\n  &gt;\n    &gt; Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real.

It is the only ancient religious tradition on the Earth which talks about=\r\n the right time-scale.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Few are the scientists that are brave=\r\n enough to stand up and grant Bharat her rightful inheritance, because they=\r\n suffer from their own cultural xenophobia and religious bigotry, but that =\r\nis a whole different subject....&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is possibly only an assumption=\r\n that the universe is a construction of Consciousness, however, Consciousne=\r\nss is one of the only &quot;things&quot;, if not the *only* thing, that can=\r\n never be &quot;this&quot;. Take away everything that is &quot;This&quot;, =\r\nand the only thing left is &quot;That&quot;. It&#39;s sort of how 2 hydroge=\r\nn molecules electromagnetically bond with one oxygen molecule, and &quot;Li=\r\nve&quot; as what we humans have labeled &quot;Water&quot;. There is no such=\r\n thing as &quot;water&quot;, per se, there are only electrons, protons, and=\r\n neutrons -etc.- bumping around in a vast sea of Chaos, the substratum, wha=\r\nt we call Brahma.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;By the way, I am a Caucasian, American by birth,=\r\n who considered himself an atheist for many years (I presently live in Indi=\r\na and am Hindu). When I discovered the greatness of the Rishis, the Vedas, =\r\nUpanishads, etc., I realized how much *more* splendid this planet could be =\r\nwith the Sanatana Dharma respected for the greatness, beauty, and Truth it =\r\nholds and bestows upon us, who are also That (Consciousness is not divided =\r\nas the Upanishad states &#39;take the full from the full, and the full rema=\r\nins.&#39; I don&#39;t offhand recall the attribution.)&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I&#39;m just questioning certain basic assumptions=\r\n of Advaita &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are also &quot;assumptions&quot; that have bee=\r\nn laboratory tested in the halls of science and proven sound.&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 which seem to be totally opposite of what=C2=A0 Bhag=\r\navad Gita is saying. In fact what you are saying leads to nihilism which is=\r\n what Buddhists say. If you agree that you believe in Buddhism we can move =\r\non. But if you say all what you are saying is in Vedas , then I will questi=\r\non. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nihilism is an attitude of defeatism. It is not an attitu=\r\nde of respectful worship towards this great mystery that we call the univer=\r\nse, the cosmos, which we are a part of; and Life itself, which animates us =\r\nand all other living things.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I consider every &quot;thing&quot; as=\r\n &quot;alive&quot;. The main difference in us is that we have a brain which=\r\n allows us access to levels of Understanding not possible without a complex=\r\n symbolic language. There is no difference between me, you, a drop of water=\r\n, a worm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance due to Maya.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I have =\r\na Mithuna Lagna (which should be obvious!) so I tend to think of things on =\r\nan intellectual level. However, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati (different facets of =\r\nshakti) makes it easy for my human mind to grasp the Dance of Life and Exis=\r\ntence, and I stand in awe before this great tapestry of Brahman&#39;s dream=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspect of the uni=\r\nverse (the Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and grants it an all-enco=\r\nmpassing power over all that is. A Shivaite would say that the Destructive =\r\naspect (entropy) is actually the engine of life, and hence Shiva is the God=\r\n of Gods. A Shakta would say that since Shakti is responsible for the appea=\r\nrance of apparent reality, then She is the God of Gods.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I say only=\r\n that Thou Art That, there is no Other. And this draw towards one Form of D=\r\nivinity or another, or the Advaitin draw towards the Formless Divine, is ba=\r\nsed on, i.e. has its foundation in, one&#39;s Karma. And hence one&#39;s Ka=\r\nrma *does* drive one on, like a chariot driver. The BG contains many, many =\r\nwonderful Truths.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 PS : I&#39;m not a =\r\nDvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I do not want to start another Dvaita v/s Adv=\r\naita thread on this forum.There have been many such threads going on on the=\r\n internet without any value.=C2=A0 I just want more solid explanation if wh=\r\nat you wrote is indeed true.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nOne does not have to declare oneself a dualist in order to be one, one mere=\r\nly divides the &quot;spiritual realm&quot; as something different and outsi=\r\nde of the material.=C2=A0 There is no material, only the appearance thereof=\r\n.

This supreme awareness is all=\r\n that IS, and abiding therein is the&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; ultimate =\r\ngoal.&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; Let us now have=\r\n a look at recent developments in scientific knowledge. At&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 &gt; one time the world around us was supposed to consist of matter,=\r\n made of&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; molecules and atoms. Physicists chased =\r\nthem further and broke them down to&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; nucleus, e=\r\nlectrons, quanta, waves, particles, and fields. Einstein said that&lt;br&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; the universe of our experience consists of matter and =\r\nenergy in a&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; space-time-continuum. He established=\r\n the famous equation E =3D mc2, where C is&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; a c=\r\nonstant representing the velocity of light. Matter and energy became&lt;br&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; interchangeable.&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; Max Planck=\r\n, famous for his quantum theory, added a further dimension to&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 &gt; this, stating that it is consciousness that is fundamental a=\r\nnd that matter&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; is a derivative of consciousnes=\r\ns. As a corollary even space and time are&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; only c=\r\noncepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are veering round to&lt;br&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; the conclusion that since every object is a sum of its=\r\n qualities and these&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; qualities are perceived b=\r\ny us, the whole objective universe of matter and&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt;=\r\n energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction of&lt;br&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; consciousness.&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 &gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere a=\r\nre experienced by us;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; there is nothing here an=\r\nywhere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; Bhagavan has told us that the world as such i=\r\ns not real. It is real as&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; Brahman or Consciousne=\r\nss. The world we see and experience with our senses is&lt;br&gt;\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 &gt; a product of the mind; the mind is a part of the ego, which rises =\r\nfrom Pure&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &gt; Consciousness, which is the same as Re=\r\nality.
