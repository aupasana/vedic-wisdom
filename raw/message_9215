For exampl=\r\ne, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.=C2=A0W=\r\ne also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=\r\n Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=\r\n spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=\r\niscipline, spirit of\n innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respecti=\r\nvely).=C2=A0Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect o=\r\nf Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect =\r\noperates.=C2=A0Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operate=\r\ns. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord V=\r\namana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates.=\r\n Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiati=\r\nve operates.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Now, let us remember one basic thing.=\r\n Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us,=\r\n happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different manif=\r\nestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these different=\r\n aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. There is no=\r\n comparison between them.=C2=A0We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perf=\r\nect it and then\n perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance bet=\r\nween all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme =\r\nBeing are incomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.=\r\n=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul ma=\r\ny like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated=\r\n by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind ope=\r\nrates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the st=\r\nory that demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a ma=\r\ntter of taste and subjective preference.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Let us f=\r\nocus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representat=\r\nive of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher =\r\nself and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.=C2=A0Once mind fancies a sep=\r\narate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the\n individualize=\r\nd consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lend=\r\ns strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness=\r\n (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc=\r\n). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of =\r\nits own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and k=\r\narmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that =\r\ndespite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving =\r\nthe fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness e=\r\nntertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, so=\r\nul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it=\r\n impassionately.=C2=A0Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. Th=\r\nis functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not se=\r\nem interesting enough to some.=C2=A0On the other hand, mind\n has likes, dis=\r\nlikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things =\r\nand achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization =\r\ngoing!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualiz=\r\ned consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is =\r\nmind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passi=\r\non and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really=\r\n the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more=\r\n to one who may be excited by this description!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Lo=\r\nrd Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspe=\r\nctive.=C2=A0Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he =\r\nreceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whate=\r\nver was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was gi=\r\nven kingdom. At the last moment, his father\n banished him to forest at the =\r\nbehest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had=\r\n no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty=\r\n to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and follow=\r\ned his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest wit=\r\nh Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it=\r\n impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he se=\r\narched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him=\r\n to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every=\r\n life situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. E=\r\nven as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impa=\r\nssionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully =\r\nlearned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!=C2=A0Rama i=\r\ns a perfect example of a liberated man\n with no desires or agendas who impa=\r\nssionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=\r\nre liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect =\r\ndemonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.=C2=A0He was born as a =\r\nlearned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable dem=\r\non king with many great qualities.=C2=A0Wisdom/discrimination makes one hum=\r\nble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qu=\r\nalities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased unt=\r\nil that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, =\r\nthen demonic qualities are completely suppressed.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as =\r\nperfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousness operate,=\r\n based on clues from\n Maharshi Parasara.=C2=A0Let us not compare Dasavatara=\r\ns, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are more attrac=\r\nted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develop devoti=\r\non. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (th=\r\nere are different schools of thought).=C2=A0Best regards,Narasimha--------A=\r\nstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org -------- =\r\n  \n         \r\n--359656696-1589530255-1366942170=:56076\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aum Shri G=\r\nurubhyo Namah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Respected Sirs,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;I have a small doubt in this regard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;For exam=\r\nple take the avtars of shri parasu rama &amp; shri rama.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the=\r\n God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha afte=\r\nr Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spirituality tha=\r\nt the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;I w=\r\nant to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear =\r\nprogression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wb=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected fo=\r\nrm.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For =\r\nexample, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars,\n respectively.=\r\n&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;We also\n know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus=\r\n, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiati=\r\nve/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being=\r\n happy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and det=\r\nachment (respectively).&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Correspondingly, each avatara is an =\r\nexpression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an =\r\nexample of how that aspect operates.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Lord Rama&#39;s story is a =\r\nperfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected=\r\n example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example o=\r\nf how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected=\r\n example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind =\r\nin us, energy in\n us,\n learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us=\r\n, discipline/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the=\r\n same Self. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has=\r\n different qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison betw=\r\neen them.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it=\r\n and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between al=\r\nl aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being a=\r\nre incomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.&lt;wbr&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;One who is fascinated by the qualiti=\r\nes of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who =\r\nis fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates=\r\n how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom ma=\r\ny like the\n story that\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But th=\r\nis is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and m=\r\nind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic a=\r\nttributes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or disl=\r\nikes.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agend=\r\nas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from th=\r\nat fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY =\r\naspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, =\r\nlearning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and ye=\r\nt has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witne=\r\nsses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature giv=\r\ne proper fruits\n later\n on. It does all that despite full awareness that it=\r\n is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other =\r\naspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the notion that they =\r\nare doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this=\r\n play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionately.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wb=\r\nr&gt;Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of =\r\nan impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting enoug=\r\nh to some.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and a=\r\ngendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achievi=\r\nng things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Th=\r\nough soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consciou=\r\nsness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that k=\r\neeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even=\r\n decides/affects\n every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss=\r\n&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one wh=\r\no may be excited by this description!&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life=\r\n in perspective.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates.=\r\n At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realize=\r\nd. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after=\r\n marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished hi=\r\nm to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given=\r\n the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-=\r\nbrother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled a=\r\nll three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sit=\r\na in the\n forest\n with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would caus=\r\ne problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidna=\r\npped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted=\r\n Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her lat=\r\ner. He accepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best po=\r\nssible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or a=\r\nnger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to =\r\nhim and respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear wit=\r\nh Ravana!&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with =\r\nno desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising fr=\r\nom the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul do=\r\nes!&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;As another example, let us=\r\n look at\n Lord\n Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom=\r\n/discrimination operates.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;He was born as a learned pygmy. He=\r\n filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many=\r\n great qualities.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and=\r\n unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities=\r\n (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that=\r\n pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then de=\r\nmonic qualities are completely suppressed.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wb=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be unde=\r\nrstood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousnes=\r\ns operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Let us not=\r\n compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if =\r\nyou are\n more\n attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara mo=\r\nre and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.=\r\n&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;By the way, happy Hanumajjaya=\r\nnti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of thought=\r\n).&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Best regards,&lt;wbr&gt;Narasimha&lt;wbr&gt;--------&lt;wbr&gt;Astrology &a=\r\nmp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;wbr&gt;--------&lt;wb=\r\nr&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div=\r\n&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--359656696-1589530255-1366942170=:56076--\r\n\n"}}
