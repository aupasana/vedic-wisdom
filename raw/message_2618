So many conscious, \nsub-conscious and super-conscious thoughts are always running in the mind \nand they stop the mind from becoming absolutely still. When mind lets \neverything go and becomes still, then the deity can fill the mind. That \nbliss is indescribable and far higher than any normal happiness one may have \nexperienced. That is what one is chasing when one meditates.\n\nWhen mind is getting withdrawn a little from body and some of the conscious \nthoughts, it is possible that some sub-conscious thoughts lying beneath the \nsurface come to the fore. It is not that you are attracting anything. It is \njust a thought or impression or memory stored in the sub-conscious mind. As \nmind&#39;s awareness of body and other things it is normally conscious of \ndecreases, it may become more aware of some sub-conscious thoughts. If you \nnegotiate those and learn to ignore those, then mind&#39;s awareness of some \nsuper-conscious thoughts may increase. As you refuse to be distracted by all \nthese and try to focus the mind on the mantra and mantra alone, eventually \nmind will reach a state of stillness. There is no thumbrule to success, \nexcept trying.\n\nAs meditation after homam is more effective, it is possible to make progress \nfaster. However, one still needs to work hard and long to achieve perfection \nin focus. Even great saints and yogis took many years. Just keep trying.\n\nNext time such a thing happens, do not think much about it and be \ndistracted. Keep the mind focused on the mantra. Nothing is to be feared and \nnothing is to be despised. All that is there is the deity you are praying \nto. The deity fills the entire universe. If you see or hear or perceive \nsomething other than the deity (e.g. &quot;my body&quot;, a ghost trailor), it is \nbecause of mind&#39;s faulty perception. When mind perceives correctly, there \nshould be nothing existing in the universe other than the deity. Fix this \nthought in your mind and keep trying.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metllapalli@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, September 24, 2009 3:21 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] wandering of thoughts...\n\n\n&gt; Respected Sir,\n&gt;\n&gt; So far I have been performing homam with great success and have seen lots \n&gt; of positive changes in me.\n&gt; But yesterday during homam when I was meditating a glimpse of a ghost \n&gt; trailor which came in tv the other night suddenly flashed my mind. It \n&gt; scared me. I immediately reverted my thoughts to god. But my mind was very \n&gt; disturbed after that. Can you attract negative energy like this? Will it \n&gt; have any bad effect? Thanks sir for all the guidance you have been giving \n&gt; I have been following them with great sincerity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sudha\n\n\n"}}
