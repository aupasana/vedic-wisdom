U may abuse him or =\r\ndoubt his existence.\nU r a soul which is nothing but God in itself. Lord Bu=\r\nddha never agreed with traditional concept of God. But he attained &#39;Nirvana=\r\n&#39;\nby observing certain principles.\nKaliyug has such power which disuades on=\r\ne from following right path at slightest of discomfort.\nU might have seen s=\r\nome atheists enjoying. Please do more research u will find them also suffer=\r\ning equally either earlier or later. Taking birth in this world itself mean=\r\ns that one will suffer in this world. Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, or any other=\r\n avatar of god, suffered a great deal which we human can not even imagine, =\r\njust to show humankind that human birth is full of misery.\nSwami Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramhansa suffered throat cancer and he could not even drink water durin=\r\ng last days. But he never waiverd from chosen path. \nU can find countless p=\r\nersons who suffered. So do not consider suffering a reason for deviating fr=\r\nom spritual path.\nUrs wavering from the path shows that u had skin deep lov=\r\ne for God. One jolt and it is out of urs system. Love God unconditionally. =\r\nLoving God must not be linked with any material outcome. God will alter &quot;Ka=\r\nrma Theory&quot; for u but definitely with deeper love and devotion will strengh=\r\nthen ur soul which will make u firmer to face adversities in life more easi=\r\nly\n\nThat&#39;s what I think.  I have personally suffered a lot physically. Suff=\r\nered two dreaded diseases, one of which crippled me six months.\n\nRegards\n\n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vemparlaramkishore&quot; &lt;vemparlaramkisho=\r\nre@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure Narasimha Ji will look at your qu=\r\nestions and answer them much more clearly.

He neither punishes nor rewards.In othe=\r\nr places as well Lord Krishna says the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; The current situati=\r\non you are facing is not because of God.It is entirely because of the karma=\r\n done by oneself in the past life. God is not the perpetuator here period. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Q2 Most people with good conduct I see these days are suffering an=\r\nd those who happily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life=\r\n. Where is the supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism is a differ=\r\nent issue, but last year made me realize that materialistic troubles made m=\r\ne very weak spiritually too. So, I dont see them to be connected somehow.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately there is a time lapse between action and fruit of acti=\r\non.If a seed is sown today can you expect to eat the fruits tomorrow, just =\r\nas an tree grows up in the natural order of time...there is a natural seque=\r\nnce in which karmas take fruit. The atheists you see today are wasting a go=\r\nlden opportunity of  utilizing this human life when the external situation =\r\nis conducive to their growth. The good people suffering today are doing so =\r\ndue to their past karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pandavas themselves had to suffer even t=\r\nhough they had Lord Krishna right beside them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Harishchandra had to se=\r\nll his wife and children to survive...what to say of us normal mortals.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Healing begins with the first step of realizing one is undergoing the =\r\nfruits of one&#39;s own actions. It is not the Navagrahas...it is not Krishna w=\r\nho is punishing us. The Navagrahas act as mere mirrors of karmic energy to =\r\nseize control of us at the right moment to administer the fruits of our act=\r\nions. They are blameless.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please take the attitude of Kunti , Draup=\r\nadi, Harischandra, Ranti Deva and many other saints who had to suffer immen=\r\nse poverty and physical pain as inspiration.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surdas the great poet sai=\r\nnt was born blind and in extremely trying family setup. Did he not blissful=\r\nly sing of his love for Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Suicide is the greatest sin ...it =\r\nis not the route of courageous men.It is the route of cowards who want to p=\r\nostpone the payments of their karma and this will force one who has committ=\r\ned suicide to take the body of a preta and hang without salvation torn by d=\r\nesires.Desires in the human body are sufficiently vexing...think if one wer=\r\ne submerged head down in water and were gasping for breath ...that is how i=\r\nntense the suffering of a preta really is.Each second the preta suffers fro=\r\nm hunger , lust , anger and so on and does not even have an body to express=\r\n it....\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear sir please do not even contemplate that thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMay god give you the fortitude to tide over your troubles.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n=\r\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nAstro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have tried=\r\n to make spiritual progress for long, and made little progress (but \n&gt; &gt; no=\r\nt significant). Ever since my childhood, primarily because of my upbringing=\r\n, I \n&gt; &gt; have been trying and observing a lot of &quot;Good&quot; things. I have been=\r\n reading texts \n&gt; &gt; on spirituality and was a lot impressed by Swami Viveka=\r\nnanda&#39;s writings. I \n&gt; &gt; always found Kabir&#39;s following lines, as a best (a=\r\nnd most compact) commentary on \n&gt; &gt; the two prominent paths of spirituality=\r\n: -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ek kahoon to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hai jaisa ta=\r\nisa rahe, kahat kabir vicharee&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I say One, it is not,=\r\n If I say two, it is contemplation&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Let it be what it is, says Kabir a=\r\nfter contemplation&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Until last year, my faith was getting stronger=\r\n and stronger in my beliefs. Last \n&gt; &gt; year made gave me lot of troubles as=\r\n well as lot of personal time to think. I \n&gt; &gt; have come up with several do=\r\nubts (just a few given below) about spirituality and \n&gt; &gt; God and Goodness,=\r\n and I have started to feel getting drifted towards atheism \n&gt; &gt; (susprisin=\r\ngly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadashi, when am observing a \n&gt; &gt; fas=\r\nt). If someone can help me understand the problesm with my doubts, it would=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; be great help:- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Isn&#39;t &quot;Ishwar Paridhaan&quot; i.e. &quot;Ishwar yat=\r\n karoti shobhanam karoti&quot; same as \n&gt; &gt; stockholm syndrome? \n&gt; &gt; - Most peop=\r\nle with good conduct I see these days are suffering and those who \n&gt; &gt; happ=\r\nily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism is a different issue, =\r\nbut last \n&gt; &gt; year made me realize that materialistic troubles made me very=\r\n weak spiritually \n&gt; &gt; too. So, I dont see them to be connected somehow.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; - I do understand that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels are low, and so =\r\ncalled \n&gt; &gt; Godly correction of the wrong doing, takes its own time. But do=\r\nesn&#39;t that \n&gt; &gt; promotes the bad karma in itself, specially in this yuga? A=\r\nnd how long can one \n&gt; &gt; wait?\n&gt; &gt; - Suicide is considered a greatest sin, =\r\nas it is throwing away the best gift we \n&gt; &gt; get from the lord. But, I am n=\r\not sure that if people do it for fun. God presents \n&gt; &gt; a person with tough=\r\n situations in the name of testing times, and some day the \n&gt; &gt; limit is re=\r\nached. Then isn&#39;t god accomplice in this so called crime.\n&gt; &gt; - In first pl=\r\nace, why does he need to test us?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I said that all these questio=\r\nn make me feel that I am losing the faith in His \n&gt; &gt; goodness. All my spir=\r\nitual progress if any has been corrupted by these testing \n&gt; &gt; times. And n=\r\no help came to me(I could not figure out). And those who did offer, \n&gt; &gt; fa=\r\nced a lot of troubles themselves and are also suffering now. This is what \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; makes me go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this that I have passe=\r\nd my \n&gt; &gt; agony to someone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Despite all these thoughts that have p=\r\nre-occupied my mind for quite some time, I \n&gt; &gt; feel that I still survive a=\r\n chance to get back to my faith in real terms and not \n&gt; &gt; driven by materi=\r\nalistic desire. This is the reason I am writing this mail. May \n&gt; &gt; be some=\r\none can make me see what I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n totally crazy, insane and moving towards atheism and quit possibly committ=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt; the so called &quot;Sin&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Sri\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
