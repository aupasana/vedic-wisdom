Consider two\nhypothe=\r\ntical factories A & B. Suppose the two factories could be arranged\nsuch tha=\r\nt the waste product of factory A would serve as a raw material for\nfactory =\r\nB and the waste product of factory B would serve as a raw material\nfor fact=\r\nory A. Then the factory setup would able to run perpetually with\nzero expen=\r\nditure and unlimited profit! However this has always been nothing\nmore than=\r\n a fantasy. The raw materials in every factory are quite expensive\nto obtai=\r\nn and the waste products are quite useless and expensive to even\ndispose of=\r\nf.\n\nAmazingly enough, such a symbiotic factory setup already exists in natu=\r\nre:\nhuman respiration & plant photosynthesis. At every moment we human bein=\r\ngs\nbreathe in O2 & give out CO2.\n\nO2 is life-sustaining & CO2 is life-destr=\r\noying, if present in excessive\nquantity. Therefore the human respiration by=\r\n itself would diminish the\nsupply of O2 & increase CO2 in the atmosphere so=\r\non making the atmosphere &\nthe planet inhabitable for human beings and inde=\r\ned all O2-breathing\ncreatures.\n\nBut there is a magnificent balance system i=\r\nn nature which exactly takes in\nthe waste product of the human respiration =\r\nCO2 & gives out the raw material\nfor respiration O2 - plant photosynthesis.=\r\n\n\nIsn=E2=80=99t it remarkable that what the best scientists on the planet c=\r\nould\nnothing more dream about has already realized by nature? Albert Einste=\r\nin has\nremarked, &quot;There are two ways to live life. One is to see nothing as=\r\n a\nmiracle & other is to see everything as a miracle.&quot;\n\nSome people say tha=\r\nt nature certainly works remarkably, but its working is\nautomatic & more or=\r\n less governed by chance. They argue that seeing any\ndivinity or God contro=\r\nlling nature is just a sentimental longing coming from\nan unscientific ment=\r\nality.\n\nHowever the word =E2=80=98automatically=E2=80=99 used in this conte=\r\nxt is somewhat misleading\nbecause it doesn=E2=80=99t indicate the absence o=\r\nf a controller, but rather the\nabsence of the knowledge of the controller.\n=\r\n\nWhen we say that a machine works automatically, what it means is that the\n=\r\nmachine doesn=E2=80=99t require continuous interaction with the operator. B=\r\nut still\nthere is an operator who activates the machine and monitors its wo=\r\nrking. Is\nthat the case with nature?\n\nE.g.

By\nstaying out of view of the child, you rel=\r\nease the toy & it comes moving into\nthe view of the child.\n\nSeeing the toy =\r\nmoving automatically, the child becomes astounded and thinks\nthat the toy i=\r\ns working by itself. But you a wise person will never be\nmisled into the co=\r\nnclusion of an inexperienced child. You know that even if\nthe toy is moving=\r\n automatically, it is programmed by you.\n\nSimilarly the magnificent phenome=\r\nna in nature are not just occurring\nautomatically; they are working under t=\r\nhe expert but remote and therefore\ninvisible programming of God.\n\nUninforme=\r\nd people, like the naive child, may think that nature is working\nautomatica=\r\nlly, but wise people throughout history =E2=80=93 religious and scientific\n=\r\n=E2=80=93 have always understood that there is a super-intelligent designer=\r\n behind\nnature.
