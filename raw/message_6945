However, I have some question=\r\ns and comments. \n=C2=A0\n1. While I have no doubt about your point that cast=\r\nes are portable and not determined by birth is a very valid one and hard to=\r\n argue about, example of Vishwamitra is a far better one than that of Valmi=\r\nki! The reason being, as Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao, an eminent scholar in=\r\n his 42 day Ramayana Pravachanam says, Valmiki is not a tribal by birth but=\r\n he is Son of Prachetana, a brahmin of Bharadwajasa Gotra and his name was =\r\nAgni Sarma! How he became a hunter and eventually became a great sage is a =\r\ndifferent story but I believed that he=C2=A0was not a sudra by birth, based=\r\n on his lectures. \n=C2=A0\n2. Also he goes on to say that his Disciple Bhara=\r\ndwaja is not the same as the Bharadwaja of Saptarishi set! Agni Sarma himse=\r\nlf (Valmiki&#39;s original name) is of Bharadwajasa Gotra, according to him! It=\r\n is quite possible that even in olden days, different people shared the sam=\r\ne name! I would like to hear your views on this. \n=C2=A0\nI am completely in=\r\n agreement that homam is a very powerful sadhana and ever since I started d=\r\noing it daily ( from the last fifteen days), I can see that my confidence i=\r\nn handling everything has increased manifold! I am just doing Ganapathi hom=\r\nam along with Sandhya vandanam and I find this practise a pretty beautiful =\r\none. But I am not able to control my anger at all! I am very short tempered=\r\n person and cannot tolerate delays and keep yelling at my kids and wife a l=\r\not! I am not seeing that homam is helping me there, but I just enjoy the ri=\r\ntual itself and keep thinking that my clarity is increasing because of this=\r\n. I had quite a few material setbacks but keep thing that my bad karma is g=\r\netting burnt and never doubted the positive effects of homam for a minute! =\r\nPlease let me know if my thinking is right!\n=C2=A0\nNagraj\n\n\n--- On Thu, 7/2=\r\n1/11, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] RE: Non Brahmin,Completed 108 Gan=\r\napathi Homams --Dont you think this is Guru Krupa?\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\nDate: Thursday, July 21, 2011, 2:01 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\nNamaste Srini=\r\nvas,\n=C2=A0\nI am glad you are doing homam and overcame drinking, smoking et=\r\nc. It is very inspiring and can inspire others too to overcome weaknesses. =\r\nOvercoming external weaknesses such as drinking, smoking, drugs etc and int=\r\nernal weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc, is the true sign of one&#39;=\r\ns progress with a sadhana. You are definitely on the right path and keep go=\r\ning!\n=C2=A0\nAs Vimalananda says, nature conspires to help one who truly wan=\r\nts to learn and do a sadhana!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAs some people =\r\nhave already pointed out, one&#39;s varna is decided by one&#39;s aptitude and atti=\r\ntude. Valmiki must&#39;ve been a great brahmin in previous lives, but some karm=\r\nas made him take birth as a shoodra and eventually his original samskaras t=\r\nook over and he became a brahmin, a rishi and a maharshi. He even taught br=\r\nahma jnana to Bharadwaja, one of the saptarshis!\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, if one i=\r\ns drawn to fire, does homam over a period of time and overcomes some weakne=\r\nsses, obviously strong samskaras are present from previous lives. If they a=\r\nre allowed to dominate, one will make progress. One becomes a true brahmana=\r\n with sadhana. As one realizes true knowledge internally, one may even beco=\r\nme worthy of teaching spiritual knowledge to others, including brahmanas by=\r\n birth!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nNot only non-brahmins from India, but =\r\npeople not born in India/Hinduism are doing homam regularly. Some of them a=\r\nre (will be) making great progess too. As a result, a strong Brahmin (true!=\r\n) class will be established across the world and that will increase dharma =\r\non earth.\n=C2=A0\nJust yesterday night, one Russian origin CS professor from=\r\n Canada who was in Boston as a visiting scholar at MIT came to my house and=\r\n learned homam. He did Ganapathi homam at my house with my help and plans t=\r\no do it in Canada. He has Jupiter in Pisces in 12th house and I got a nice =\r\nfeeling when he was doing homam. There were also several good omens, making=\r\n me think he is relatively well-prepared for sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nA dirty golden=\r\n vessel is more valuable than a brightly shining copper vessel that is gold=\r\n-plated! You just need to clean the former..\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nThis homam movement is in nascent stages yet. Once a critical mass of sadha=\r\nkas accumulates and people start making progress, it will spread like a wil=\r\ndfire. There is no hurry and there is need to feel pressure, for these thin=\r\ngs happen due to the will of higher beings. We are all merely instruments.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nI tend to think that there are blessings of some great saints/yogis =\r\nbehind this. When we did Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we ca=\r\nsually selected a muhurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that=\r\n maha-poornahuti happens on an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Ma=\r\nnish received a command from the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and =\r\nManish took the sankalpa at the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa&#39;s lunar birthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time w=\r\nhen the angle between Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I starte=\r\nd daily homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manu=\r\nals a few months later, there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 l=\r\nunar years since Ramakrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a visi=\r\non of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine =\r\nMother, during that week of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I\n =\r\nam not attached to forms and I rarely get visions.\n=C2=A0\nSeveral months be=\r\nfore that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real=\r\n (i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naa=\r\nd (buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during =\r\nthose days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front o=\r\nf the fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before,=\r\n sat in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what y=\r\noga means etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed in=\r\nto Manish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, and I was aw=\r\nare of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in my m=\r\nind. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week or =\r\ntwo later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week later to=\r\n check out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the interne=\r\nt, I found a photo (apparently the only photo\n available of that yogi). It =\r\nlooked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in my d=\r\nream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a famou=\r\ns yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his phot=\r\no before that or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his comin=\r\ng in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire was s=\r\ntrange, because homam movement did not start then and I was not thinking of=\r\n fire or fire ritual at all.\n=C2=A0\nThere are some signs like this, which m=\r\nake me think that we are being used as instruments in a big &quot;project&quot; desig=\r\nned by some great yogis in higher realms. It seems to me like this project =\r\nhas an important purpose and will help MANY people in their quest for god, =\r\nin the coming decades and centuries.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ri=\r\ntual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam108\n----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nOn Thu, Jul 21, 2011 at 4:42 AM, =\r\nsrinivas wrote:\n\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 Hi: \n\nI am a non Brahmin, fortunately I came =\r\nacross Homam manuals/videos in internet.

If they are allowed to dominate, one will ma=\r\nke progress. One becomes a true brahmana with sadhana.

Once a critical mass of sadhakas accumu=\r\nlates and people start making progress, it will spread like a wildfire.

When we did Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we casually=\r\n selected a muhurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that maha-=\r\npoornahuti happens on an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Manish r=\r\neceived a command from the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and Manish=\r\n took the sankalpa at the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa&#39;s lunar birthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time when th=\r\ne angle between Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I started dail=\r\ny homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manuals a =\r\nfew months later, there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 lunar y=\r\nears since Ramakrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a vision of =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine Mother=\r\n, during that\n week of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I am not=\r\n attached to forms and I rarely get visions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV ali=\r\ngn=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;Several months befo=\r\nre that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real (=\r\ni.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naad =\r\n(buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during th=\r\nose days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front of =\r\nthe fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before, s=\r\nat in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what yog=\r\na means etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into=\r\n Manish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, and I was awar=\r\ne of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in my min=\r\nd. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week or tw=\r\no later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week later to c=\r\nheck out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the\n internet=\r\n, I found a photo (apparently the only photo available of that yogi). It lo=\r\noked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in my dre=\r\nam seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a famous =\r\nyogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his photo =\r\nbefore that or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his coming =\r\nin my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire was str=\r\nange, because homam movement did not start then and I was not thinking of f=\r\nire or fire ritual at all.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00=\r\n0000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT co=\r\nlor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;There are some signs like this, which=\r\n make me think that we are being used as instruments in a big &quot;project&quot; des=\r\nigned by some great yogis in higher realms.
