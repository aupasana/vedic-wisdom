The thing is =\r\nthat\n&gt; please understand, the difference between your surface personality a=\r\nnd\n&gt; your true self( which you realize eventually by penance).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhana=\r\n is basically a process in which you/deity kill your&quot;self&quot;. Let\n&gt; us say th=\r\nat you are\n&gt; &quot;Puneet/Nikhil/Gaurav/Chetna/Savitri/Mark/Andrew/John/Ali&quot;. Yo=\r\nu see, all\n&gt; ahutis in the homam are actually meant to be sacrifice of part=\r\ns of this\n&gt; personality and eventually the whole personality in the purna -=\r\nahuti\n&gt; where in you sacrifice your entire self to the deity in the fire.\n&gt;=\r\n Actually the purna- ahuti is your funeral, if you are able to look at it\n&gt;=\r\n in that manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please understand that all joys and sorrows are limit=\r\ned to your own\n&gt; false self. What you think is the best for yourself ,actua=\r\nlly is more\n&gt; often than not that good. It might be good for your limited s=\r\nelf, but\n&gt; mind you , it isn&#39;t good for &quot;you&quot;. And to tell you very honestl=\r\ny, god\n&gt; doesn&#39;t really care much for your limited self and its endless des=\r\nires,\n&gt; wants, desires. Mr god wants you to be out of this convoluted mess,=\r\n and\n&gt; be back with him/her/it ASAP and the only way you are coming back is=\r\n\n&gt; when the false self is completely free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now how is that? You pay of=\r\nf Karma&#39;s. Now how the hell do you that? You\n&gt; suffer and stay silent. You =\r\ndo not make a cry and hue about it and\n&gt; continuously chant. Crying and sho=\r\nuting actually makes god sentimental\n&gt; and you extract out some stuff, mayb=\r\ne\n\n\n"}}
