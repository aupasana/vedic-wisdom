Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste=\r\n,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Every tradition has a valid basis, but also corrupted in time..\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; So many people touch the feet with hands or forehead when bowing \nto eld=\r\ners. It is incorrect to say that &quot;all of elder&#39;s punyas&quot; are \ntransferred t=\r\nhen. So many people touch the head of youngsters with \nhand to bless. It is=\r\n incorrect to say that &quot;all of youngster&#39;s sins&quot; \nare transferred then.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; However, this belief is not without a basis. When a person touches \nthe =\r\nfeet of a person with awakened energy, *some* transfer of energy \noccurs au=\r\ntomatically, whether or not one is aware (that is why we \nhave the traditio=\r\nn of touching the feet of saints). However, how \nmuch energy gets transferr=\r\ned is dependent on the capabilities of the \ntwo persons, the strength of th=\r\ne desire in the two persons for (or \nagainst) the transfer and the previous=\r\n rina between the person.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is not necessary to touch the feet of a =\r\nperson with the \nforehead. It is possible to touch with hands and receive e=\r\nnergy. \nOnce one young man came to my Jyotish class in Boston and touched m=\r\ny \nfeet at the end to take blessings. Normally, when people to do that, \nI =\r\nmentally say &quot;sarvam Sri Krishnarpanamastu&quot; and imagine that the \nobeisance=\r\n is going to Lord Krishna. But, this time, I could clearly \nfeel some energ=\r\ny leaving me. It was a very tangible feeling. This \nperson touched specific=\r\n spots in the two feet with a specific mudra \nof the two hands.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of co=\r\nurse, one can dismiss my feeling as a hallucination. But, \nwhen the same yo=\r\nung man came to a Satya Narayana vratam at my house \nlater in the week and =\r\ntouched the feet of a very good priest who \ncame from India (the same one w=\r\nho I said performed the first Chandi \nhomam at my house, arranged for the s=\r\nhata Chandi homam in Chennai \nand had books on homam gifted to us), he imme=\r\ndiately exclaimed &quot;sir, \nwe have to be careful with this boy! He seems to d=\r\no some sadhana. He \ndefinitely knows how to take away some energy from peop=\r\nle.&quot; I had \nnot told him what I had experienced a few days back and this wa=\r\ns his \nindependent conclusion after the same experience as mine!\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am=\r\n convinced that some enegy give and take happens when feet and \nhead are to=\r\nuched for blessings. However, it requires a certain level \nof ability and p=\r\nurity to receive energy from someone by touching \nfeet. So many people touc=\r\nhed my feet. Only a handful gave me the \nfeeling that some energy left me.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is another way to look at this. If a person gets something \nfro=\r\nm me, it is probably because there is some rina. Why should I try \nto resis=\r\nt a payback of rina? Who are we anyway to give or to take? \nAll the energy =\r\ndeposited in all the beings of this universe is Hers \nanyway. Why should on=\r\ne look at the energy deposited in oneself as \none&#39;s own?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt;  \n&gt; My simple bottomline advice is this:\n&gt;  \n&gt; If someone pays ob=\r\neisance to you, let them do it. Do not feel \nproud or superior when someone=\r\n touches your feet. Think that Krishna \n(or Shiva) in him is paying obeisan=\r\nce to Krishna (or Shiva) in you \nand offer it to Krishna (or Shiva). When y=\r\nou touch the feet of \nsomeone, feel humble and think that the person you ar=\r\ne bowing to is \na limited manifestation of Krishna (or Shiva). Leave the re=\r\nst of the \nkarma/energy calculations out and do not worry.\n&gt;  \n&gt; At the sam=\r\ne time, if someone does not let you touch his/her feet, \njust bow to them a=\r\nnd pay obeisance in the mind without a physical \ntouch. You can still feel =\r\nhumble and think that the person you are \nbowing to is a limited manifestat=\r\nion of Krishna (or Shiva).\n&gt;  \n&gt; A lot of this is in the mind and controlli=\r\nng the mind is the key.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.com=\r\ncast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n&gt;   From: vinayak tandle \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com ; sohamsa@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, October 05, 2008 10=\r\n:51 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] CHARAN SPARSH OBEISANCE\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         =\r\nAdarniya Narasimha Guruji Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;         I had arranged for the firs=\r\nt time Chandi Homam at my house \non Friday. The Brahmin priest did a excell=\r\nent pooja. During Durga \nswaroopini Kanya(small girl 7 years old) poojan I =\r\nasked her to take \nher feet out so that I could touch the her feet with my =\r\nforehead to \noffer my obeisance & I normally do touch the feet with my fore=\r\n head \nduring the Namaskar. The Brahmin Pujari prevented me from touching \n=\r\nthe feet of girl as well as his feet with my forehead saying that if \na per=\r\nson touches the feet of a guru/elder with forehead all the \npunya of the Gu=\r\nru/Elder will transfer to me & incase the Guru keeps \nhis hand on my head a=\r\nll his sins will be transfered to me.
