By making you face the \nresults of some karmas, fully or partially, god can test you. Try to keep \nyour love, devotion and surrender to your deity through the tests. With a \ndeity like Mahalakshmi, very rigorous testing that you cannot withstand is \nunlikely.\n\nAs far as possible, one should try not to be distracted by these things and \nkeep the focus of the mind on the deity when engaging in the ritual.\n\nRegarding feeling the presence of the deity, it is good. However, make sure \nit does not increase ego and pride.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metllapalli@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, September 12, 2009 4:03 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] homam question....\n\n\n&gt; Respected Sir,\n&gt;\n&gt; It has been two days since I have started my Mahalakshmi homam with \n&gt; sincere prayers. I have been an ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalakshmi for \n&gt; a long time. On the second day itself I felt the presence of the diety in \n&gt; the kund. I don&#39;t know if it is my imagination but at the same time I also \n&gt; see sudden bad events happening to me. Should I consider it a good sign? \n&gt; Is God testing me or is it my karma? Kindly guide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sudha\n\n\n"}}
