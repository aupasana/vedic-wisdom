The deity&#39;s persona=\r\nlity is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing himse=\r\nlf, so self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolutio=\r\nn continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me w=\r\nhich is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is=\r\n a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, th=\r\nen your power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). Afte=\r\nr the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if =\r\nhe was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for th=\r\nese beings. \n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma o=\r\nnto the heads of the attackers and some people may realise this to their de=\r\ntriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his=\r\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black=\r\n magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a norma=\r\nl person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you ha=\r\nrmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is ident=\r\nifying with the universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe it=\r\nself attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his ide=\r\nntification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Sh=\r\nakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti=\r\n which can be used, moreover=C2=A0then their minds and intellects will not =\r\nbe free of identification with the body and so their actions are those whic=\r\nh are generally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same s=\r\npirits which they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable exp=\r\nerience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetime=\r\ns, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadh=\r\nak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous ef=\r\nfort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifeti=\r\nme may feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may =\r\nnot acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding =\r\nis in the eating, so let me suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so incli=\r\nned, then starting on some good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some=\r\n=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day=\r\n, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materi=\r\nals.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on ru=\r\ndraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from=\r\n the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a bear=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty b=\r\nefore you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure=\r\n 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLong and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some sa=\r\ndhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post this on t=\r\nhe list as a clarification from me if you feel that this is suitable.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

If anyone has said otherwise, I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; also disagee with him/her.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned the above with res=\r\npect to the need of thousands of mantras and technicalities. If one does no=\r\nt want to command god and wants to be a beggar who will take whatever is gi=\r\nven, there is no need for thousands of mantras and all the umpteen technica=\r\nlities.=C2=A0These thousands of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for =\r\ncommanding thousands of different results from god. That is why I talked of=\r\n commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works slightly differently=\r\n than one may imagine. I will elaborate.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Also, commanding go=\r\nd is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, which can=\r\n be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually and suffer=\r\ning from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as gods is pos=\r\nsible only for a spiritually=C2=A0elevated person with no or extremely smal=\r\nl ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achievemen=\r\nt. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in comple=\r\ntely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat som=\r\nething from the previous mail to clarify:\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The universe =\r\nhas many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. Th=\r\nere are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, th=\r\nere are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control th=\r\ne mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverbe=\r\nrating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfe=\r\nct absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal cha=\r\nnges by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the man=\r\ntra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and cor=\r\nresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Each=\r\n set of &quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Variou=\r\ns mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging self-awareness in=\r\n a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as &quot;commanding a resu=\r\nlt&quot; from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essentially that.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; But the bottomline is this: Only =\r\na highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results from=\r\n god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an unatta=\r\nched=C2=A0instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Vari=\r\nous mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant=\r\n for such sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Those are hardly of use to so many peopl=\r\ne out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot c=\r\nommand specific results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the =\r\nresult, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), eve=\r\nn if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated r=\r\nules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities,=\r\n they will be better off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, w=\r\nithout worrying about so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and su=\r\nrrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like=\r\n a beggar, take whatever and whenever he gives.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Keep praying=\r\n every day or every second when you are able to. Even when you are not pray=\r\ning, remember him in all of your actions. When you enjoy something in the m=\r\naterial world, tell yourself that it is his and that=C2=A0he gave it to you=\r\n. If you remember him all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start=\r\n to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important t=\r\nhan picking the right mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too base=\r\nd on unreliable knowledge coming from questionable sources!).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There may be a mountain with thousands of =\r\npaths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot=\r\n (different experience) on the top and show a different scenery (result). E=\r\nxpert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) t=\r\no see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a handicap=\r\nped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant o=\r\nnly to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfu=\r\nlly climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very little ego).=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actua=\r\nlly climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain a=\r\nnd traverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers =\r\nwho are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take customize=\r\nd mantra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a result quic=\r\nkly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The power =\r\nof a powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained =\r\n*after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is ak=\r\nin to a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a pa=\r\nrticularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to sur=\r\nvive the climb along the long path.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; We need to emphasize the=\r\n attitude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing t=\r\nhe choice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many g=\r\nreat spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasi=\r\nze picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasize=\r\nd having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, =\r\npersistence, discipline, humility etc!!!!=C2=A0*That* is a lot more importa=\r\nnt and useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day et=\r\nc and impress god.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\nen should the worship of a graha be done?

Parasara does not mention any d=\r\nay for doing homam to a graha.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; In fact, if one wants, one ca=\r\nn do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every day. It is even bette=\r\nr that way.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday,=\r\n it is fine. But saying that doing it on so and so day will bring serious d=\r\nangers because Mars is an enemy of so and so planet would be stretching thi=\r\nngs.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna=\r\n dvaipaayana) got his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for=\r\n him, where did they get it from?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; From Self -=C2=A0from with=\r\nin.

Vara is also agni tat=\r\ntva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi.=\r\n Karma has been advised in the vaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora =\r\nof the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting =\r\nand other such karma related to rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna =\r\nMarga for details].\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moon is the significator of the Aroodha. I=\r\nt is the *emotional content* related to the maya manifestation of everythin=\r\ng in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the karma associated tha=\r\nt resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of self punishment and cor=\r\nrection related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Just as Agni has the pu=\r\nrity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related to the UL is surely =\r\ngoing to cleanse the sins associated with the suffering in it. While this m=\r\nay not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content has not been addresse=\r\nd, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs and people find their part=\r\nners, get married and get along with life. Proof lies in the pudding and wi=\r\nth so many cases where people have fasted on UL days and have got result, w=\r\ne have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why fast? Fasting on vaar=\r\na is a means to correcting the flaw associated with the raashi. Raashi is a=\r\n quantity and hence it\n&gt; &gt;  is related to the material effects of the bhava=\r\n and that is what people are looking for when they come to th astrologer. Y=\r\nou have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C r=\r\nemember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should worship a female =\r\ndeity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting. I wonder if =\r\nthey really follow this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not give fasting at night instead=\r\n of day? Sun is always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why w=\r\ne have limited this to day fasting and not night fasting as well or 24 hour=\r\n fast. This is my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have given lo=\r\nng periods of fast starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for t=\r\nhe birth of child! You think I should be doing that! You think anyone will =\r\nlsiten. Try it yourself before asking me to advise those hard penance kind =\r\nof fasts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha.=\r\n It is the sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for=\r\n getting married and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging m=\r\narriage. Either they want to get into one or get out of one and into anothe=\r\nr...astrologe rs these days are relegated to helping people make these tran=\r\nsitions painless and fast. Of course some have come and I have not failed t=\r\nhem. I have a ready shloka for this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C start from Tau=\r\nrus in Hamsa gati:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gouri, Kaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Durga, Kanti, S=\r\naraswati\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mangalaa, Vaishnavi, Lakshmi, Shivaa, Naraayani\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; See I have them ready for the 12 signs in Hamsa Gati from the mool =\r\ntrikona of Moon in hamsa gati\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra Shastra is a very detaile=\r\nd work and includes mantra dosha etc. It is very scientific and accurate. I=\r\nt takes a lifetime to master this. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You talk of begging God vs=\r\n commanding God? Now where did that come from? How is it related to what is=\r\n under discussion. Perhaps I have missed many mails and am not able to get =\r\nthe context. Trying to command God is *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable =\r\nto say the least. The attitude should always be that of a beggar in front o=\r\nf God. If anyone has said otherwise, I also disagee with him/her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Prasiddha mantras always give result, even without initiation and who k=\r\nnows how ready a person is for initation. So I prefer sticking to prasiddha=\r\n mantras with people who do not have initiations. This is there in VRA also=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have some questions where I have doubts about what you say=\r\n.

His section on remedial measures is full of variou=\r\ns homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and =\r\nI am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them b=\r\ny themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you =\r\ngone through the Navagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana and other pur=\r\nanic literature?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tit=\r\nhi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for speci=\r\nfic birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi o=\r\nr nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on=\r\n any house or arudha in the chart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya =\r\ndosha is to be performed on Amavasya, when should the worship of a graha be=\r\n done? Let us say someone wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do y=\r\nou think this worship should be done?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the principles I a=\r\nm questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do=\r\n you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his knowledge and those who=\r\n wrote it as scribes for him, where did they get it from?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seco=\r\nnd, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated pr=\r\ninciples that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring peop=\r\nle that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause &quot;dange=\r\nr to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope.=\r\n I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may b=\r\ne a little difference between doing an austerity on different days, but my =\r\npoint is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing and no=\r\nt doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause danger as =\r\nbeing suggested.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I missed the conte=\r\nxt and just saw some mails that were forwarded to me amidst my writing. But=\r\n them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in that many many have benefi=\r\ntted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Third, our shastras primar=\r\nily talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the en=\r\nergy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or week=\r\nday or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irre=\r\nspective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man c=\r\nomes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is =\r\nbetter off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is=\r\n more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s =\r\nnot right...at least people who read this will think. Let=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=84=A2s say Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the =\r\nSun and is not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E2=80=9C a day after Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devata of=\r\n Mercury and is worshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C again a day after! So what happened to the energy equati=\r\non? J\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is more =\r\nimportant and the variations based on individual horoscope are less importa=\r\nnt. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations. But they are smalle=\r\nr and, more importantly, I question if they are actually well-understood by=\r\n astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and ove=\r\nr-selling unreliable principles of questionable origin and scaring people o=\r\nn that basis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have =\r\nnot understood even the basics of Sanatana dharma! Some behave as if there =\r\nis a battle going on between Shiva and Vishnu =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C it=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s hilarious to see how these are just attempts to c=\r\nonvert Hinduism into a religion they have left rather than trying to learn =\r\nwhat Hinduism means. Being newly converted there is a bellicose patriotism =\r\nin them to prove their faith to the *new god* they have found and every oth=\r\ner God must be the devil in disguise!! It will take years for many to learn=\r\n that there is no devil.

I got into this thread because statements=\r\n were made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart can cau=\r\nse &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot; and &quot;danger to spouse&quot;, based on th=\r\nese far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which is perfe=\r\nctly in line with everything I have learnt.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Well, you once t=\r\naught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gour=\r\ni/percepti on. That was meaningful. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with=\r\n Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri and water. I question whether t=\r\nhe new theory on fasting is really in line with everything you have learnt =\r\n(and taught).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; BTW, I specifically asked for a clarification =\r\non whether this was based on your own thinking or from classics/parampara (=\r\nsee quoted mail below for the full context). Like so many times with simila=\r\nr questions I asked privately and recently publicly, you did not respond.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Statement 1 is an arrogance =\r\nthat the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and has no relevance as the=\r\n remedial measures prescribed by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Parasara and others to be done on sp=\r\necific days are irrlevant and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not of much consequence.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n First of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or=\r\n tithis based on any arudhas or houses in a chart.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; For dosha=\r\ns in birth chart or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the =\r\nblessings of planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and descr=\r\nibed how to perform them. His section on remedial measures is full of vario=\r\nus homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and=\r\n I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them =\r\nby themselves.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tit=\r\nhi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for speci=\r\nfic birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi o=\r\nr nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on=\r\n any house or arudha in the chart.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Thus, the principles I am=\r\n questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Second, I said what I =\r\nsaid in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated principles that are =\r\nnot found in classics or works of rishis and scaring people that performing=\r\n austerities such as fasting on certain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;s=\r\nerious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I find these prin=\r\nciples illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may be a little differe=\r\nnce between doing an austerity on different days, but my point is that it i=\r\ns smaller compared to the difference between doing and not doing at all and=\r\n that doing it on=C2=A0a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause danger as being suggest=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Third, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping var=\r\nious deities on various days, based on the energy of the *deity*. For worsh=\r\nipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better tha=\r\nn others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the person worship=\r\nping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out with more money to gi=\r\nve to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better off going and begging o=\r\nn that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is more important.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is more important and the=\r\n variations based on individual horoscope are less important. I am not sayi=\r\nng there are no horoscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more impor=\r\ntantly,=C2=A0I question if they are actually well-understood by astrologers=\r\n=C2=A0today to apply *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selli=\r\nng unreliable principles of questionable origin and scaring people on that =\r\nbasis.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Statement 2 is an a=\r\nrrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the Rishi=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; seers.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I did not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest =\r\nthat our ability to use it is limited and we should take our limitations in=\r\nto consideration.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The universe has many lokas (planes of con=\r\nsciousness) , many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic inter=\r\nactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible man=\r\ntras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a m=\r\nantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly=\r\n), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-aw=\r\nareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy in=\r\nternally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes correspo=\r\nnding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interaction=\r\ns between various objects.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; However, this variety of mantras,=\r\n experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not have such perfec=\r\nt control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevan=\r\nt only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hence control ov=\r\ner mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare today. Most peo=\r\nple are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do not=C2=A0work for th=\r\nem as they are supposed to.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; J=\r\nust repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some peo=\r\nple may think that certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain n=\r\number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one pers=\r\non quickly and another may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may=\r\n happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra=\r\n to really work and it is much more difficult than one may think.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A highly learned scholar in the cour=\r\nt of a king may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants from =\r\nking. An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather than trying t=\r\no command (and failing for sure).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, most people are=\r\n better off begging god for what they want rather than trying to use the ri=\r\nght mantra to command what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabul=\r\nary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness=\r\n, surrender, patience and=C2=A0persistence are what help a beggar succeed. =\r\nA beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this age and ti=\r\nme, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; What people today need for material and spiritual progress =\r\nthrough remedial measures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a=\r\n better choice of tools such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday=\r\n, tithi etc to command a specific result from god.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; It is wor=\r\nth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came in the last centur=\r\ny or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc.=\r\n Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitude - surrender, submissi=\r\non, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility etc.=C2=A0*That* =\r\nis a lot more important and useful than trying to be oversmart with the cho=\r\nice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but=C2=A0t=\r\nhe guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on th=\r\ne horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based=\r\n on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various traditions.=\r\n They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associ=\r\nate various mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. For ex=\r\nample, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and =\r\nA8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Lin=\r\nking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyond the scop=\r\ne of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If one has a sadguru, I recommen=\r\nd following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoretici=\r\nan.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path=\r\n. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) =\r\ninstead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter =\r\nis the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. C=\r\nhoice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in bei=\r\nng a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great =\r\nscholars.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panch=\r\nakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishn=\r\na maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=C2=\r\n=A0etc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. With=\r\nout the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I hope this sufficiently clari=\r\nfies my stand.

The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and car=\r\nries energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tith=\r\ni of the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and=\r\n gandanta may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what=\r\n is the way out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara on=\r\nly and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for doin=\r\ng so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this=\r\n?? What is happening?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element =\r\nof fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and one worships Gouri at=\r\n the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. =\r\nSo one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by water element and =\r\nfasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity and well=\r\n-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the week=\r\nday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire element represent=\r\ned by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanja=\r\ny Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is =\r\nthe 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates e=\r\nverything through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by he=\r\nr due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by th=\r\ne 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represe=\r\nnted by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Thus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in t=\r\nhe field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aa=\r\ntman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should act=\r\nually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we =\r\ndo in the tripod method in dasa judgment.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Thus, it is actual=\r\nly more logical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva=\r\n of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\ns the above &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it fro=\r\nm a classic or from tradition?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting i=\r\ns far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherw=\r\nise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra medi=\r\ntation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize =\r\nthe effect of the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with t=\r\nhis. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days =\r\nwhen one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn a=\r\nnd churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is ma=\r\nny many times better than complete fasting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is des=\r\ntined to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy=\r\n on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should med=\r\nitate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In a=\r\nny case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are he=\r\navily restrained in effectiveness.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin qu=\r\note &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta c=\r\noncepts is quite illogical.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretchin=\r\ng ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the in=\r\nterface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, th=\r\ne fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart b=\r\nut they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; [Narasimha] Putting a burn=\r\ning match in a glass of water does=C2=A0indeed kill fire. But the question =\r\nis of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in water,=\r\n it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; My point is=\r\n that the examples given have no real identifiable contact between water an=\r\nd fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; One can be creative and come up with a lot of theori=\r\nes. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all ra=\r\nsis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and some=\r\n as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause co=\r\nntact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of t=\r\nhe dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious danger.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what coun=\r\nts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolations.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Three years back=\r\n you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two years back =\r\nand again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getting very evi=\r\ndent that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different levels of their un=\r\nderstanding and intelligence. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be t=\r\naken away. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when =\r\nit seems like something comes and cry when it seems like something leaves. =\r\nSome impassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what they =\r\nsee as their dharma with the things they seem to have.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just a fact=\r\nual correction though: I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years =\r\nafter my spiritual master entered my life, my interest in other things went=\r\n down (though I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sad=\r\nhana intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. Howev=\r\ner, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Pa=\r\nrasara independently,=C2=A0meditate=C2=A0on them and share my interpretatio=\r\nns with the world.=C2=A0He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activit=\r\nies earlier, and he wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and wi=\r\nthout an attachment. He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jy=\r\notish and wants me=C2=A0to do it as an unattached karma.=C2=A0His word is e=\r\nverything for me.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; What I told you recently is not that I was=\r\n leaving Jyotish but what I said above.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; However,=C2=A0if you=\r\nr judgment is correct and=C2=A0if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure=\r\n my spiritual guru will realize it sooner or later and change his command t=\r\no me.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can =\r\ncategorically declare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekda=\r\ny or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that=\r\n weekday or tithi and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of=\r\n the day. You can take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration o=\r\nf time (say, a few months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and =\r\nkeep the vrata for the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the durati=\r\non of the vrata, there is nothing like it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This=\r\n is a fine=C2=A0 statement but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas =\r\nand other teachings of the seers is of not much relevance. Of course you ar=\r\ne right as it will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing=\r\n to marry should not fast on UL days and should choose any day (all days ar=\r\ne the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do =\r\na mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or=\r\n maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, t=\r\nhe marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what y=\r\nou say is right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; [Nara=\r\nsimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Is all that is being ta=\r\nught and practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the se=\r\ners&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of cou=\r\nrse, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or mil=\r\nk of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make so=\r\nme difference. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious dosha=\r\ns&quot; (see the quoted mails for such claims)=C2=A0can be caused by a wrong cho=\r\nice is wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to =\r\nmake is also a gross=C2=A0exaggeration.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The main thing is th=\r\nat you need milk and sugar. If one is confused by endless claims of khoa ma=\r\nking consultants and ends up not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In s=\r\nuch a case, one can simply pick some milk or the other, take sugar and star=\r\nt cooking khoa. It will take an extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humbly and not=\r\n engage in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fasting on a =\r\nspecific weekday or=C2=A0tithi in a chart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious =\r\ndoshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and dismi=\r\nss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importance from us does not help o=\r\nur cause!\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversell i=\r\nt or overplay the importance.. .\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, aust=\r\nerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do y=\r\nou any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or=\r\n tithi without too many calculations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacha=\r\nrya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive =\r\nand this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brah=\r\nmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from p=\r\nhysical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End =\r\nquote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is muc=\r\nh more, but also very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a good =\r\nenough austerity. Physical celibacy over an extended period of time increas=\r\nes the efficacy of other austerities such as fasting, mouna vrata, meditati=\r\non and homam.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- ---------=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups .c=\r\nom, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sjrath@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; om paramesthi gurave namah\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just added a few thoughts and quest=\r\nions since we are on the topic of spirituality, which is not my forte.
