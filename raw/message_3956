I was born on fix date..so\n&gt; as i am going to die on any fix date only.. it is all decided....\n&gt; Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, failures everything about me\n&gt; is decided by god  well in advance.. it is like a film.. my end\n&gt; is already decided.. but i amnot aware of this.. so Doing homam\n&gt; will help me changing my end?  Whatever i am destined to get.. i\n&gt; will get...\n \nOne can also say in the same vein: Do I have to go to work to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows, success, failure everything about me and my family is decided by god in advance. It is like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will happen to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we will get. Will my going to work or not going to work change things?\n \nOf course, one does not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard to find a new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened to the logic that &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?\n \nWell, from one reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But you, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to that reference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you can engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to those actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very important and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have performed an action or skipped an action only because god had already decided so. But you do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, don&#39;t you? In the previous example where one lost a job, won&#39;t one look for a new job?\n \nPerhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at home and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at home and yet something will happen and family will do fine. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, but not get a job and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, get a job and family will do fine.\n \nIt is absolutely true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffering) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. However, given that you don&#39;t know what god willed and what will happen, you cannot convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL happen. So do not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSuppose you are trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a really heavy wind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you there or you can row the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you constantly re-evaluate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that you finally reach the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes your rowing, you cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not row well, wind may keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may not reach the bank. You keep doing your best to row in the correct direction. If wind took you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start crying. Then wind may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective of the outcome, the best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep rowing.\n \nIf you start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also blowing harder than before and you are not making progress, do not stop rowing. If you do, you may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind does not blow the same way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come when your rowing will be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes you in the correct direction. So, just row row row your boat...\n \nPonder on this metaphor a little.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe same logic that applies to looking for a job above applies to doing homam and other spiritual sadhana. Do they change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same way looking for a job actively when you are out of one does.\n \nPerhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and one will be stuck without any progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet something will happen and one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana, but not make much progress in the next few years or lives. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana and make good progress.\n \nIt is absolutely true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. spiritual progress) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n \nJust as searching for a job is a good strategy in general for one without a job and wanting family not to suffer, doing spiritual sadhana such as homam and japam is a good strategy in general for one wanting to make spiritual progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI want to emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up family and their welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma you are doing now, but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachment to a result does not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety regarding whether the desired result will happen or not will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop one from operating at one&#39;s best. Decide your actions based on a desired outcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may not be achieved even though your actions seem at this point of time to be the best possible actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.\n \nSuch a karma yogi is always doing the best possible actions and wasting very little time on worrying about things not in one&#39;s control. It is a very effective strategy materially as well as spiritually!\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requires\n&gt; sacrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures ? Can&#39;t we have\n&gt; both?\n \nSpiritual progress and material success can co-exist. But spiritual progress and attachment to (and worrying about) material success tend to pull one in different directions.\n \nDo not see world as a place where you seek pleasures or enjoyments, but see it mainly as a place where you *give* enjoyment to others. Focus on giving. You may also *receive* pleasures in the bargain, but do not strive for it or calculate it or focus your mind on it.\n \nWhat you give now is in your hands. What you get now is in god&#39;s hands and is decided based on what you gave earlier. What you give now decides what you will receive later. Spiritual progress essentially means realizing this and focusing the mind, its thoughts and actions on giving to the world, rather than receiving. Even as you focus your mind on giving, you will also receive some things. But exactly what they are is based on what you gave in the past, which is water under the bridge, and hence you have no control over it now. This is true irrespective of whether you are attached to what you receive or not.\n \n*        *        *\n \nJust keep doing sadhana. My feeling is that you are one of the people who will make very good progress in coming years. Rome is not built in a day.\n \nMy intuition strongly tells me that Vishnu homam is the best for you. If you want, you can keep doing occasional Chandi homam like you are doing now. But why don&#39;t you consider replacing the daily Ganapathi homam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra naama stotra and do homam with it.

At that time i had started doing homam ofcourse with a hope of overcoming all my present problems..  Initially i have started doing mahaganapathi homam once a week.. then since past few months i have been doing it daily..Since last month i have started doing chandi homam also.. four times a month..I will be honest here that i have been doing this homams with a hope of having material benefits and spiritual progress as well.. I also would be more honest by telling that my inclination is now more on material benefits as i have family..kids.. responsibilities etc... no doubt i want to have spiritual progress too.. but  i have not reached to that stage where i can focus myself fully in to it..i lack sadhnas..and i am absolutely in nursery standard as far as spiritual classes are concerned.. it is just a beginning of my spiritual\n&gt;  education.\n&gt;  \n&gt; What i am trying to ask you here is.. I was born on fix date..so as i am going to die on any fix date only.. it is all decided.... Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, failures everything about me is decided by god  well in advance.. it is like a film.. my end is already decided.. but i amnot aware of this.. so Doing homam will help me changing my end?  Whatever i am destined to get.. i will get...and as you have said it is all based on my rinas and past karmas..BUT... Doing homam will change my destiny? or Doing homam will help me to write my own destiny?  I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requires sacrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures ? Can&#39;t we have both?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have tried my level best to put my thoughts here. I am sorry if i am found stupid here.. I will be obliged if you could kindly spare some time to reply.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rajesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 7/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Vimalananda spoke thus:\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: &quot;shashi_nambisan&quot; &lt;shashin@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sunday, 7 March, 2010, 10:51 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Though this may be true in general, specific examples can be found for Krishna devotees who did not have to forgo material comforta or devotees of the divine Mother who were tested by taking away everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; It depends on the karmas and conditioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, one thing is certain. Whether it is Krishna or Chandi, they may test by pushing the person to an extreme, but they never push beyond the breaking limit.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the mind identifies with something, that thing may be negatively affected by god to let one realize that that thing is transient and does not matter. As one realizes it a little, it may be more negatively affected. Finally, one may be pushed to an extreme.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, god is kind (even an ugra devata). God never pushes one to the breaking limit. God may push one short of the breaking limit. The breaking limit may change and then god may push further.\n&gt; \n&gt; To use the analogy from the other mail of today, god the teacher does not test the 5th grade student with 6th grade questions. Of course, a 5th grade student passing from 5th grade to the 6th grade will now be tested with 6th grade questions. As one advances from one grade to another, one is tested more and more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- shashi_nambisan &lt;shashin@gmail. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste All,\n&gt; &gt; This depends on the selection of diety.
