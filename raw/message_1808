None of the primitive aboriginal ancestors  of the presentday race on th=\r\ne Earth like the European,Negroid, Mongoloid, or the Vedic Aryan, or the Hi=\r\nndu race could have been the first inventor of the  idea of Godhood.  How t=\r\nhen, could it come to be inherited by the human race on the Earth?\n       B=\r\nut still the idea of God as a supreme, World-Transcending Universal Mind  w=\r\nho  has created all that exists.,Can not be discovered by Cave Man say abou=\r\nt 80,000 years, So when it Happened? Beacuse such an idea dose not get into=\r\n Cave Man thinking or his Mind during his day to day Life of Eating, Huntin=\r\ng, Fighting, and Mating, and sleeping. The daily life of a cave man as equa=\r\nl as an animal in that period. The daily Life of a Cave Man nor his daily l=\r\nife drive him towards the  discovery of a World Spirit--.  \nWhom he can cal=\r\nl as the &quot;Father of Heaven&quot; or as  the Asiatics still love to worship as &quot;M=\r\nother Nature&quot; of all her children, including Mankind. \nSo where the God com=\r\nes? First who find the Supreme God? Why He Looks in different &quot;Rupas&quot;? What=\r\n is his intension finally?
