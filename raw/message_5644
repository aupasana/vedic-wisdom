This is the first law of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Giving a potentially life-altering astrological reading is an action t=\r\nhat \n&gt; &gt;will \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;have a reaction.

I am not an \n&gt; &gt;emotional \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;person, but this made my ey=\r\nes wet. If I was there, I would&#39;ve washed the feet \n&gt; &gt;of \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;this be=\r\nggar and sprinkled the water on my head. This kind of pure thinking is \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nso \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;difficult to find now-a-days...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Once when I was =\r\nin Alandi, I heard two blind beggars talk inside the temple \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;presmi=\r\nses. One of them said that he has recently been initiated by someone \n&gt; &gt;in=\r\nto \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the Varkari path and he can now sing Abhags (spiritual songs i=\r\nn Marathi) in \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;company of other initiates. He was very hap=\r\npy. The other beggar asked him, why \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;don&#39;t you sing the abhangs wh=\r\nen you beg. You will get more money, your singing \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is terrific. Th=\r\ne first man replied that he cannot use songs of God for earning \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;m=\r\noney, even if the money is coming through begging. God is beyond everything=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;else. Begging is for my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not m=\r\nix the \n&gt; &gt;two.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When I heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also there) I =\r\nwas stunned. This coming from a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;begger! This created a strong imp=\r\nact on my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Such is the power of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who m=\r\noulds the consciousness of all \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;who go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Kr=\r\nishna temple at Alandi, where Gyaneshwar Maharaj is believed to be \n&gt; &gt;stil=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;meditating in the underground chamber (I have no doubt about it=\r\n), is one of \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;most spiritually charged places I have been =\r\nto.
