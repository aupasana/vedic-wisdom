The hall was clean\nand c=\r\nool and the sofa was fully covered with colored shawls and a tiger&#39;s\nskin, =\r\nbut Bhagavan himself had only a loincloth on his body and nothing\nmore. In =\r\nthe subdued light of the hall, his body shone like burnished gold\nand his e=\r\nyes were luminous, full of flashes of some very intense inner life.\nThe mor=\r\ne I looked at him, the more his face seemed to be radiating a\nmysterious li=\r\nght, the source of which was somewhere deep within. I found\nmyself unable t=\r\no guess his mental state. I could not make out whether he was\naware of the =\r\nworld or not, whether he saw me or not, whether he was in some\nyogic trance=\r\n or in contemplation of something quite beyond my vision and\nknowledge.\n\nTh=\r\ne hall was full of silence, serenity and peace. About twenty people sat on\n=\r\nthe ground, apparently in deep meditation. When the bell rang for the midda=\r\ny\nmeal, he invited us all with a nod of his head and we followed him to the=\r\n\ndinning hall. In the dinning hall, orthodox Brahmins were sitting apart,\nb=\r\nehind a bamboo screen, while Bhagavan was sitting with non-Brahmins and\nsom=\r\ne of the Brahmins who did not follow caste restrictions.\n\nAfter food I was =\r\nasked to clean the spot where I had eaten and take away the\nbanana leaf tha=\r\nt was used as a plate. Anywhere else I would have taken it as\na sign of dis=\r\nrespect. But I told myself that it may have been a necessary\nlesson and so =\r\nI swallowed my pride.\n\nThe next morning I went again to the Ashram and sat =\r\nnear the door facing\nBhagavan. Some government officer, accompanied by a re=\r\ntinue of peons,\nentered the hall and at once started telling Bhagavan how c=\r\norrupt the\ngovernment servants were, how they abused and misused their posi=\r\ntions, how\nthey quarreled and fought among themselves making the administra=\r\ntion\ninefficient and unreliable, how he had been entrusted with the task of=\r\n\ncleaning up the government machinery and how he was busy fighting against\n=\r\nall the evils of the world. He complained that in his loyalty to his\nsuperi=\r\nors, who had given him their confidence, and in his anxiety to make a\nsucce=\r\nss of himself, he had lost his peace of mind and had come to ask\nBhagavan t=\r\no make him calm and contented. It was clear that he thought\nhimself to be a=\r\n very important person whose request must be promptly met.\nAfter he had fin=\r\nished talking he looked expectantly at Bhagavan, as if\nsaying: &quot;Now it is y=\r\nour turn to show what you can do.&quot;\n\nBhagavan did not even look at him. The =\r\nhours were passing, but Bhagavan was\ncompletely silent. The officer lost pa=\r\ntience, got up and said: &quot;You are\nsilent, Bhagavan. Does it mean that you w=\r\nant me to be silent too?&quot; &quot;Yes,\nyes.&quot; Said Bhagavan, and that was all.\n\nI o=\r\nnce asked him &quot;Bhagavan, my mind does not obey me. It wanders as it likes\na=\r\nnd lands me into trouble. Be merciful to me and tell me clearly how to\nbrin=\r\ng it under control.&quot; Even before I completed the question Bhagavan\nturned t=\r\no me and looked at me affectionately. He spoke to me most kindly and\nhis wo=\r\nrds sparkled with meaning: &quot;All religious and spiritual practices have\nno o=\r\nther purpose than getting the mind under control. The three paths of\nknowle=\r\ndge, devotion and duty aim at this and this alone. By immersing\nyourself in=\r\n your work you forget your mind is separate from your work and\nthe problem =\r\nof controlling the mind ceases. In devotion, your mind is merged\nin the God=\r\n you love and ceases to exist as separate from Him. He guides your\nmind ste=\r\np by step and no control is needed. In knowledge, you find that\nthere is no=\r\n such thing as mind, no control, controller, or controlled. The\npath of dev=\r\notion is the easiest of all. Meditate on God or on some mental or\nmaterial =\r\nimage of Him. This will slow down your mind and it will get\ncontrolled of i=\r\nts own accord.&quot;\n\nSomehow I felt satisfied and there was deep peace in me wh=\r\nen I looked at him\nfor the last time.\n\n=E2=80=94 Ramana Smrti\n\nSource: http=\r\n://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2009/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=\r\n=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd2be78f819510488cefa6a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;IN 1932, I had the good fortune=\r\n to attend a conference of cooperative organizations, which was held at Tir=\r\nuvannamalai.&lt;/span&gt;It enabled me to see the holy Arunachala Hill and also p=\r\nay a visit to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.
