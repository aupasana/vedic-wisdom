Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whatever is one&#39;s path, Kundalini is not only awakened but goes to \n&gt; &gt; Sahasrara\n&gt; &gt; when one is established in undifferentiated Self. Even if one does not \n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; in those terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that one can\n&gt; &gt; realize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more accurate\n&gt; &gt; statement would be that one can realize the highest truths without \n&gt; &gt; engaging\n&gt; &gt; in any specific practices geared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha\n&gt; &gt; yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini. People belonging to various\n&gt; &gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; awakening, without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. \n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and\n&gt; &gt; raised kundalini implies a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the lowest level, we bind our selves to specific bodies and our\n&gt; &gt; self-awareness is limited to a body, a name and other things associated \n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; the body and name. This experience of self as a body corresponds to\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the\n&gt; &gt; undifferentiated Self, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This\n&gt; &gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As\n&gt; &gt; self-awareness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse \n&gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; many stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first time, \n&gt; &gt; like a\n&gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down again and the\n&gt; &gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work \n&gt; &gt; its\n&gt; &gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable\n&gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the time \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high \n&gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; the impurities. This may manifest physically as a powerful experience\n&gt; &gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path \n&gt; &gt; taken\n&gt; &gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may change \n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; person to person, based on the impurities in various nadis. The exact\n&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed and the final \n&gt; &gt; point\n&gt; &gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, rise to \n&gt; &gt; Sahasrara\n&gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. His nadis had\n&gt; &gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went into\n&gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully realized \n&gt; &gt; person.\n&gt; &gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Saying &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The\n&gt; &gt; exact experience changes from person to person, depending on the path\n&gt; &gt; traversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one \n&gt; &gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not have \n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; confusion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs, \n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; may confuse various other experiences (such as some movement of vayu in\n&gt; &gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think that kundalini \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are \n&gt; &gt; NOT\n&gt; &gt; due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little vaayu\n&gt; &gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a\n&gt; &gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the\n&gt; &gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the \n&gt; &gt; sensation\n&gt; &gt; of having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting normally in\n&gt; &gt; reality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a reference, I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He was\n&gt; &gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few \n&gt; &gt; months\n&gt; &gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, he had\n&gt; &gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninformed about\n&gt; &gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specific \n&gt; &gt; raja/hatha\n&gt; &gt; yoga practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect and eyes \n&gt; &gt; closed\n&gt; &gt; and meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini \n&gt; &gt; awakening, he\n&gt; &gt; started experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru told him not to \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; distracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra and try to forget\n&gt; &gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on an experience, it gets \n&gt; &gt; stuck\n&gt; &gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely \n&gt; &gt; focused\n&gt; &gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly he became\n&gt; &gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was a really tremendous explosion \n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of electric \n&gt; &gt; current\n&gt; &gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it felt like he was not a \n&gt; &gt; body\n&gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he was going up like a rocket at a\n&gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a tremendously bright \n&gt; &gt; white\n&gt; &gt; light and there was nothing else. It felt like he was not a small point \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; that light, but he was the light itself. There was an undescribable \n&gt; &gt; sense of\n&gt; &gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is \n&gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt; What happened to my body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became\n&gt; &gt; aware of himself as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja \n&gt; &gt; room\n&gt; &gt; and went out, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For \n&gt; &gt; example, a\n&gt; &gt; serial was coming on TV and characters in the serial that he normally\n&gt; &gt; disliked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like real people \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; he had great love and compassion for those TV serial characters (and \n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; real people too). That state of love and compassion lasted a while and \n&gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This short experience was only the beginning of a journey. He \n&gt; &gt; experienced\n&gt; &gt; many things later on. These experiences were different from each other. \n&gt; &gt; As I\n&gt; &gt; said earlier, the experience varies based on the path traversed and the\n&gt; &gt; point reached by the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions,\n&gt; &gt; kundalini rose and he saw several sights and several beings within and \n&gt; &gt; heard\n&gt; &gt; several sounds, including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He realized the transientness of a lot that we cling on to and the \n&gt; &gt; existence\n&gt; &gt; of something far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All this slowly started to change his attitude. His senses turned \n&gt; &gt; inwards\n&gt; &gt; and he critically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives and \n&gt; &gt; worked\n&gt; &gt; on correcting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him,\n&gt; &gt; what others did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that \n&gt; &gt; kundalini\n&gt; &gt; awakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Depending on\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or even lives.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the rise \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of people\n&gt; &gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very \n&gt; &gt; few\n&gt; &gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after, but end up getting stuck \n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; Very very few make it to higher chakras. And a very small minority \n&gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; realise self.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether you are into \n&gt; &gt; raja\n&gt; &gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical\n&gt; &gt; experience can only distract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, \n&gt; &gt; especially\n&gt; &gt; those who respect my advice, to forget about kundalini and chakras and \n&gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; keep doing homam and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep\n&gt; &gt; purifying themselves with sadhana, keep working on their attitude and\n&gt; &gt; thought process and keep improving self-control. When (or as) mind \n&gt; &gt; becomes\n&gt; &gt; purified and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini \n&gt; &gt; WILL\n&gt; &gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and \n&gt; &gt; mystical\n&gt; &gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual\n&gt; &gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; way your mind works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will\n&gt; &gt; automatically follow. One will do well to remember these words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Relevant to this on going subject, i remember reading autobiography of \n&gt; &gt; Shri\n&gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; Awakening is not mandatory for realization.

When one attains a perfect focus on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exist. This is similar to death, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel a kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused. So one should sustain the state where there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full focus on mantra and no other distractions, for as long as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These things happen automatically without thinking about them and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in any specific practicies. In fact, thinking about them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific practices may become an obstacle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delay things. If you surrender to a deity and do a mantra with a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT run after any experience and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think of an experience as an end result. The focus should be mantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra alone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even when an experience occurs, I tell people to not be tied to it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not think too much about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suchaka dream is a vision of something that is going to happen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 03, 2009 5:17 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Resolving Points)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly( Urdhwa Retas),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the room (even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commanding a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is� very little� according to me which is black \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detriment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moreover�\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some� call this the� Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n"}}
