With a big roar, he sud=\r\ndenly sprang into action. This great golden being took out tiny pieces of g=\r\nold from himself, moulded them into various shapes and moved them like pupp=\r\nets, enacting a drama. As one puppet hit another, the latter puppet became =\r\nangry at the former puppet. The great golden being made puppets like and ha=\r\nte other puppets and engage in various actions with others.\nHe made some fa=\r\nir rules for the drama. Every puppet received equal and opposite reactions =\r\nfor its actions towards other puppets. As he made puppets see others and wi=\r\nsh for several things, he eventually gave them what they wished for, after =\r\nthey helped enough in fulfilling the wishes of other puppets. The rules mad=\r\ne the drama engaging, self-sufficient, long and lively.\nHe occasionally cru=\r\nshed a puppet and made a puppet of another shape with the material and chan=\r\nged its role in the drama. But he lent some continuity to the drama by enab=\r\nling that puppet to still get equal reactions to its previous actions and m=\r\nake it follow its previous desires even without realizing it. However, he m=\r\nade the puppets unaware of the continuation and made them very very scared =\r\nof being crushed.\nHe occasionally made a rare puppet finally not fear being=\r\n crushed, not wish for this or that, do all its actions with no like or dis=\r\nlike to other puppets or to actions themselves. He then &quot;freed&quot; it from the=\r\n drama - he mixed in himself the gold that made the puppet.\nHe made some pu=\r\nppets curious to understand the whole drama. After they contemplated enough=\r\n, he even made some &quot;see&quot; everything that happened! But he made them misund=\r\nerstand some details.\nSomeone thought the original motionless being represe=\r\nnted the pristine state that one should strive to merge into. He did not re=\r\nalize that motionless golden being and animated great golden being were one=\r\n and the same. Even if one merged into the motionless golden being, that be=\r\ning would oneday spring into action and become the animated great golden be=\r\ning!\nThere were multiple theories on whether a puppet could ever merge in t=\r\nhe animated great golden being, whether the puppet would then become a &quot;par=\r\nt&quot; or &quot;full&quot;. There came to be varying theories on the relationship and sup=\r\neriority of motionless golden being and the animated great golden being. Th=\r\nere were also theories on how the great being suddenly sprang into action f=\r\nrom the motionless Brahman, i.e. what made him do that. Some considered the=\r\n great being impermanent and Brahman permanent. They did not realize that b=\r\noth were the same. It was a cycle - the great being was sometimes animated =\r\nand sometimes his animation withdrew and he remained motionless over an ext=\r\nended period. Both were the same being.\nThe great golden being made some pu=\r\nppets speak eloquently about above theories and claim all-knowingly, &quot;whate=\r\nver I am doing is done by the great being and not by me&quot;. Yet, by pulling i=\r\nnvisible strings, great being made them feel internally that they were doin=\r\ng everything! He made them do terrible things to others with vengeance and =\r\nhe made them pay for it. He kept remaking them in different forms in the dr=\r\nama and made them experience various things.\nOne wise puppet came along and=\r\n said, &quot;forget all conflicting theories. What matters, O fellow puppets, is=\r\n to overcome your likes, dislikes, fears etc and participate in the drama w=\r\nithout getting carried away. Whether you merge in in animated great golden =\r\nbeing or motionless golden being, whether you become part or full upon merg=\r\ning, is irrelevant now. What matters now is to work on your individual cond=\r\nitioning and overcome it.&quot;\nThe great golden being of course made that &quot;wise=\r\n&quot; puppet speak those words. He pulled the invisible strings to influence va=\r\nrious puppets variously by those words!------------------------------------=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\r\n------=_Part_4018667_485563764.1416669843672\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:He=\r\nlveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size:13px&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something I posted on facebook may be=\r\n of interest here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Great Gol=\r\nden Being: An Allegory&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There was once a motionless g=\r\nolden being called Brahman.
