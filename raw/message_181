I expect=\r\n to upload the mp3 for the latest manual in 2 weeks. Yes, I realize that au=\r\ndio helped, and will help, many.\n \nChandi homam is quite powerful. If one w=\r\nith strong desires performs it well for a period of time, one can fulfil mo=\r\nst desires. Thus, there is scope for abuse. On the other hand, if one perfo=\r\nrms it well for a period of time without much desire, She can put one on th=\r\ne fast track and give a high level of detachment and very quick spiritual p=\r\nrogresss. It can sometimes be too quick for the person.\n \nChandi (also refe=\r\nrred to in the saptashati as &quot;Narayani&quot; or the energy of Narayana) is the u=\r\nnification of various energies represented by Braahmi, Vaishnavi, Maheswari=\r\n, Koumari, Vaaraahi, Kaali etc. She is the union of Mahakaali, Mahalakshmi =\r\nand Mahasaraswati - three root energies behind the creation, sustenance and=\r\n destruction of this universe. If someone is ready to worship that *primord=\r\nial energy* in fire, I can give some instructions privately. But there are =\r\nno plans to create a Chandi homam manual like Mahaganapathi homam manual.\n =\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n \n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji... \n&gt;  \n&gt; Many thanks for your=\r\n post on how to do ganapathi homam... am planning to\n&gt; learn & do the 15 mi=\r\nn homam asap, probably then will move on to the 45\n&gt; mins procedure \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nKindly advice when we may expect the mp3 mantra file for the homam. this\n&gt; =\r\nwill really speed up our learning & get to &#39;hands-on&#39;  sooner\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, i=\r\ns the chandi homan, you mention below also going to have a\n&gt; simpler ( simi=\r\nlar to ganapathi homam) version for beginners\n&gt;  \n&gt; with sincere regards\n&gt; =\r\nManju\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: sohamsa@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom [mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\n&gt; Of Narasimha P.V.R.

Venus is the 6th\n&gt; lo=\r\nrd and Moon is the 8th lord in 6th with 12th lord Ketu.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I feel that y=\r\nour dasamsa lagna should be Pi and not Ar. So I changed the\n&gt; birthtime to =\r\n13:47. The 6th lord Sun in lagna with Moon and Venus can\n&gt; explain ayurveda=\r\n work, while 10th lord Jupiter in Sc can explain the\n&gt; astrology work.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Marriage was in Venus-Saturn antardasa (as per Chaturaseeti sama dasa).\n&gt;=\r\n Venus is karaka and Saturn is the upapada lord in rasi and the 7th lord\n&gt; =\r\nin navamsa.\n&gt;  \n&gt; You are running Saturn dasa. Unfortunately, there is no R=\r\nahu dasa in\n&gt; Chaturaseeti sama dasa and he gives his results in Saturn das=\r\na. Rahu is\n&gt; quite bad for you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He is the 2nd lord of wealth and he i=\r\ns in gandantha in 12th. He shows\n&gt; big losses. It is not a time to invest a=\r\nnd take risks.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Moreover, Rahu and Saturn take part in Braahmana Shaap=\r\na yoga and Maatru\n&gt; shaapa yoga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Durga Saptashati is the best solutio=\r\nn to 2nd lord Rahu in 12th in\n&gt; gandantha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I see that you do a lot of=\r\n mantras. If one wants water, one should dig\n&gt; in one place. Instead of dig=\r\nging 10 ft in 20 places, one can dig 200 ft\n&gt; in one place and then one is =\r\nguaranteed to find water. You were born in\n&gt; this family and received a lot=\r\n of religious and spiritual foundation in\n&gt; this life. You are very lucky. =\r\nBut it also raises the bar for you. Gods\n&gt; accept a small prayer from an un=\r\neducated man, but one with a lot of\n&gt; resources and learning like you is ex=\r\npected to do heavy sadhana and then\n&gt; only gods are pleased. You enjoyed th=\r\ne low-hanging fruits in the\n&gt; previous lives and now you have to read the t=\r\nopmost branches to enjoy\n&gt; some fruit.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of doing 10-20 mantras=\r\n, you should stick to one mantra until you\n&gt; fully experience that mantra a=\r\nnd the devata of the mantra. Then you can\n&gt; move on to another mantra. So m=\r\ny humble suggestion is to stick to one\n&gt; mantra or sadhana and maximize you=\r\nr efforts in it. A time should come\n&gt; when one completely forgets self, the=\r\n body etc and the whole world\n&gt; reverberates with the mantra and the deity =\r\ncomes before/within one. Then\n&gt; only the sadhana is complete. When sadhana =\r\nin one mantra is incomplete,\n&gt; why do more sadhanas?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Homam (fire ritu=\r\nal) is more effective than worshipping an idol or a\n&gt; kalasham. If you can =\r\nlearn Chandi homam in laghu paddhati (2 hours) and\n&gt; do it once in the morn=\r\ning and once in the evening (or atleast once in\n&gt; the day) for 128 days, yo=\r\nu should see a big improvement in your material\n&gt; and spiritual lives.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; With some heavy sadhana with Chandi patham/homam, you can recover most\n&gt; =\r\nof your investment and minimize the loss. But, in future, do not make\n&gt; any=\r\n risky investments. This is not your time to do such things.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/h=\r\nomam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;            =\r\n             \n&gt; &gt;   Dear Narasimhanji, Vedokta Namskaram,\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;     Af=\r\nter going through your prediction, It arouse my interest to ask\n&gt; you a qus=\r\ntion on my horoscope. Kindly excuse me for taking your valuable\n&gt; time.Than=\r\nking you for patience shown in reading my lengthy naration.\n&gt; &gt; I am confus=\r\ned and lack of direction. Please throw some light upon the\n&gt; following horo=\r\nscope details.\n&gt; &gt;   I have 5 grahas in exaltation and still I am strugnlin=\r\ng a lot at\n&gt; this age of 53 years. Please help me to come out these bad kar=\r\nmic and\n&gt; tell me what I have to do to remedy for the present condition...\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   Whatever I earned I spend 65% of the money for doing puja, visiting\n&gt;=\r\n temples, gifting to Brahmins.. That is only strength for me.Since from\n&gt; m=\r\ny childhood I use to recite Devi Patam and even now after taking\n&gt; initiati=\r\non from respected esteemed guru, I receit Durga Sapta Sati and I\n&gt; continue=\r\n to do. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   I Can master any subject so quickly and I will almos=\r\nt lead so much\n&gt; after which I leave it as it may not produce enough income=\r\n to me. \n&gt; &gt;   So by the way I did my Accountacy Bachelor Degree1972 - 76 w=\r\nith\n&gt; Great difficulty and as per father wish I took CA and I left\n&gt; unfini=\r\nshed1980-83. \n&gt; &gt;   Then I was searching for a suitable job, by the time \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;   I learnt Astrology, so I started earning money in Astrology (1980\n&gt; ti=\r\nll now,) so I gave up Idea of searching job.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Then there was n=\r\not enough  income to support myself I learnt the\n&gt; technique of Printing an=\r\nd designing and DTP programme and Computer\n&gt; assembling and programme and t=\r\nrouble shooting and I was quite earning\n&gt; very good, but soon I have to giv=\r\ne it up, bcaz of the technology is\n&gt; outpaced now. \n&gt; &gt;   Then I learnt Ayu=\r\nrvedic medicine and I was quite successful in\n&gt; curing challenging disease.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   At the age of 42 I got marriage proposal only becase of my\n&gt; success=\r\nful curing of 12years old disease to my wife&#39;s aunty. I got\n&gt; married on 25=\r\n Mar 1996. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   I also don&#39;t know what combination in my horoscop=\r\ne make me apt\n&gt; successful in Ayurvedic medicine. It is still to my wonder =\r\nI have cured\n&gt; many incurable and challenging diseases and it is not my tal=\r\n claim,\n&gt; (people cal me Doctor). Almost my contacts of cured people is aro=\r\nund\n&gt; 10000 people. Out of which a few are in very good position. But I nev=\r\ner\n&gt; aimed monetary gain in this noble profession.\n&gt; &gt;   I gave up that als=\r\no due to lack of income i.e procurement cost of\n&gt; medicinal herbs. \n&gt; &gt;   M=\r\ny father died on 28 Mar 2003. So he had left a house which we sold\n&gt; and I =\r\ngot a share of 25% as I have three brothers younger to me.  \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\nDue to my next younger brother insistence I invested all amount in a\n&gt; Clea=\r\nring and farwarding business and till date, I either get the\n&gt; promised amo=\r\nunt of commission nor my principal amount. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   So, I started gat=\r\nhering strength to borrow money and started Share\n&gt; trading. Now I am also =\r\n losing in that also and making gain heavily\n&gt; equally.ultimately still los=\r\ns is more than income. I get quarrel often\n&gt; with my family people.\n&gt; &gt; Ple=\r\nase guide me in these circumstances, what should I do. i.e puja or\n&gt; mantra=\r\n, or ritual to get maximum benefit out of my horoscope. . At this\n&gt; age aft=\r\ner toying with many business, I don&#39;t know what to do.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   I sinc=\r\nerely do puja as my father left with Maha Meru ( Sri Yantra)\n&gt; and Uchista =\r\nGanapathy statue and other deities in statue form . So I\n&gt; regularly and si=\r\nncerely doing puja as it is only giving comfort to my\n&gt; mind. \n&gt; &gt;   Earlie=\r\nr I did Meditation and pranayama and yoga for almost 15years\n&gt; 1987 to 2002=\r\n, tat also help me in maintaining calmess. \n&gt; &gt;   I met with serious accide=\r\nnt on 25 Aug 1998 out of which I seriously\n&gt; hospitalised for nearly 3 mont=\r\nhs.\n&gt; &gt; I give you hereunder mine and my wifes details, and expect an early=\r\n\n&gt; solution from yourself.\n&gt; &gt; Additional information::\n&gt; &gt;    I do conduct=\r\n tours to Kasi, Gaya, Allahabad, Jammu Waishno Devi,\n&gt; Kedarnath, Badrinath=\r\n, Hardwar and other pilgrimage places.

You should use \nChaturaseeti sama dasa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (84 year dasa) in your=\r\n chart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In 1998, you were running Venus dasa Moon a=\r\nntardasa. Venus is the \n6th&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lord and Moon is the 8th lord in 6th wi=\r\nth 12th lord \nKetu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I feel that your dasamsa lagna s=\r\nhould be Pi and not \nAr. So I changed the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; birthtime to 13:47. The 6=\r\nth lord Sun in lagna with \nMoon and Venus can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; explain ayurveda work=\r\n, while 10th lord Jupiter in Sc \ncan explain the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; astrology work.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Marriage was in \nVenus-Saturn antardasa (as per Chatur=\r\naseeti sama dasa).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Venus is karaka \nand Saturn is the upapada lord =\r\nin rasi and the 7th lord&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in \nnavamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; You ar=\r\ne running Saturn dasa. Unfortunately, \nthere is no Rahu dasa in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Cha=\r\nturaseeti sama dasa and he gives his results \nin Saturn dasa. Rahu is&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; quite bad for you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He is \nthe 2nd lord of wealth =\r\nand he is in gandantha in 12th. He shows&lt;BR&gt;&gt; big \nlosses. It is not a t=\r\nime to invest and take risks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nMoreover, Rahu and Sa=\r\nturn take part in Braahmana Shaapa yoga and Maatru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nshaapa yoga.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Durga Saptashati is the best solution to 2nd \nlord Rah=\r\nu in 12th in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gandantha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I see that you do \na=\r\n lot of mantras. If one wants water, one should dig&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in one place. \n=\r\nInstead of digging 10 ft in 20 places, one can dig 200 ft&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in one pl=\r\nace \nand then one is guaranteed to find water. You were born in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thi=\r\ns family \nand received a lot of religious and spiritual foundation in&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; this life. \nYou are very lucky. But it also raises the bar for you. Gods=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; accept a \nsmall prayer from an uneducated man, but one with a lot =\r\nof&lt;BR&gt;&gt; resources and \nlearning like you is expected to do heavy sadhana=\r\n and then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only gods are \npleased. You enjoyed the low-hanging fruit=\r\ns in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; previous lives and \nnow you have to read the topmost branc=\r\nhes to enjoy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some \nfruit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Instead of doing 1=\r\n0-20 mantras, you should stick \nto one mantra until you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fully exper=\r\nience that mantra and the devata of \nthe mantra. Then you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; move =\r\non to another mantra. So my humble \nsuggestion is to stick to one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; m=\r\nantra or sadhana and maximize your \nefforts in it. A time should come&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; when one completely forgets self, the \nbody etc and the whole world&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; reverberates with the mantra and the deity \ncomes before/within one. Th=\r\nen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only the sadhana is complete. When sadhana \nin one mantra is inc=\r\nomplete,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; why do more sadhanas?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homam (fire =\r\nritual) is more effective than worshipping an idol or \na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kalasham. =\r\nIf you can learn Chandi homam in laghu paddhati (2 hours) \nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; do i=\r\nt once in the morning and once in the evening (or atleast once \nin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe day) for 128 days, you should see a big improvement in your \nmaterial&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; and spiritual lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; With some heavy \nsadhana=\r\n with Chandi patham/homam, you can recover most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of your \ninvestment=\r\n and minimize the loss. But, in future, do not make&lt;BR&gt;&gt; any risky \ninve=\r\nstments. This is not your time to do such things.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nB=\r\nest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n-----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do \nGanapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A \nh=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSpirituality: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nFree Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nSriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Na=\r\nrasimhanji, Vedokta Namskaram,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After going through your \nprediction, It arouse my inte=\r\nrest to ask&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you a qustion on my horoscope. \nKindly excuse me for ta=\r\nking your valuable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; time.Thanking you for patience \nshown in reading=\r\n my lengthy naration.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am confused and lack of \ndirection.
