Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Makes you wonder about the Divine connection betwee=\r\nn all these\n&gt; &gt; supremely elevated souls!\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier, I was exerting disc=\r\nretion in sharing personal accounts, \nbut She has\n&gt; been making me drop gua=\r\nrd of late, for whatever reason. I will \ncontinue in\n&gt; the same vein for a =\r\nlittle more time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a dream a couple of years ago early in the mor=\r\nning. In the \ndream,\n&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit a=\r\nnd I were \nsitting in\n&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayam=\r\na techniques in \nthe\n&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that =\r\nI could not \nrecognize.\n&gt; It was not anybody I had seen before.\n&gt; \n&gt; I ment=\r\nioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. First \nhe said he\n&gt; di=\r\nd not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;ve \nprobably known if=\r\n\n&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it \nthere.\n=\r\n&gt; However, when we talked in the next weekend, he referred to my \ndream and=\r\n\n&gt; said he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to \nsearc=\r\nh on\n&gt; the internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in \nmy=\r\n dream.\n&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before \n=\r\nhim). Though\n&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about t=\r\nhis \nlineage and\n&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the intern=\r\net and \nfound a\n&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the per=\r\nson I saw \nin my\n&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my dre=\r\nam looked \nlike a\n&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I con=\r\nfirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and \nsaid, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt; are so=\r\n many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, I =\r\ndo not know much about kriya yoga or about the \nlineage of\n&gt; Paramahamsa Yo=\r\ngananda. Our lineage of this life starts from \nDattatreya. We\n&gt; have a spec=\r\nial attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his \nlineage and got\n&gt; a lot =\r\nof our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from \nthem. We do\n&gt; no=\r\nt have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda. \nBut,\n&gt; Man=\r\nish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he \nguessed\n&gt; w=\r\nho I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he \nguessed\n&gt; cor=\r\nrectly. That should count for something!\n&gt; \n&gt; I will not be surprised if th=\r\nere are indeed subtle connections \nbetween\n&gt; several lineages that seem dis=\r\njoint today.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison=\r\n cell of \nSri\n&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upa=\r\nnishad) \nand\n&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from P=\r\nuri contacted \nme within a\n&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru and =\r\nParamahamsa \nYogananda were\n&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Mah=\r\naraj). He is the \nkeeper of\n&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru rec=\r\neived from Yukteshwar \nMaharaj.\n&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed th=\r\nat knowledge and spent a \nday at my\n&gt; house. Thus, some small connection wa=\r\ns made with a representative \nof that\n&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After=\r\n all, some karmik debts may \nhave been\n&gt; there...\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to make one thing clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some things I mention like this m=\r\nay give the impression that my \nguru has\n&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhi=\r\ns. That may indeed be true. But he \nalways\n&gt; downplays those things and att=\r\naches no importance whatsoever. He \nsays,\n&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless pers=\r\non and lower than dirt and capable \nof\n&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She =\r\nis the connection between every \nentity in\n&gt; this universe. She may choose =\r\nan idiot like me as an instrument \nsometimes\n&gt; and do something using me. I=\r\n have no special abilities of any \nkind. Any\n&gt; coincidences you find are ju=\r\nst Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I realized in time that this simplici=\r\nty, humility and lack of ego \nis not\n&gt; fake. I also realized that this lack=\r\n of ego is what enabled him to \ndo things\n&gt; that sound impossible or diffic=\r\nult. In fact, I realized that many \ngreat\n&gt; saints in the past were like th=\r\nis. Several magical things happened \nthrough\n&gt; them, but they did not find =\r\nany pride in them and retained their \nhumility\n&gt; and sense of surrender to =\r\ntheir chosen form of god and believed \nthat god\n&gt; was the doer of all thing=\r\ns and they were mere instruments.\n&gt; \n&gt; The day you also start believing tha=\r\nt, not for the sake of \nlecturing or\n&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores o=\r\nf your heart, your sadhana \nwill bear\n&gt; fruit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJ=\r\nagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dines=\r\nh@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2=\r\n008 5:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
