Ther=\r\ne is wonder when the\nintellect is not able to comprehend a thing. anything =\r\nthat i see and my\nintellect can not explain, i say is a &#39;wonder&#39;. The more =\r\ni think about\nthis avidya, the more my intellect fails, because this aviday=\r\n is the\nvery cause for the intellect. The intellect cannot comprehend its o=\r\nwn\ncause because it is the child born out of Maya and a child cannot go\nbac=\r\nk to look for the womb. This Maya when it menifests, becomes the\nintellect.=\r\n Therefore, the intellect cannot comprehend the unmanifest\nwhich is its own=\r\n cause. The effect cannot, by itself, comprehend its own\ncause. Maya is als=\r\no called a &quot;Delusion&quot;, and a delusion can never be\nexplained. There cannot =\r\nbe a biography of the ghost i saw on the post,\nnor can i grow rich by extra=\r\ncting &#39;silver&#39; from the mother-of-pearl.\nThis Maya-Shakti, we can only say,=\r\n is an indescribable, mighty,\ninscrutable power of the Lord. Strange, for b=\r\ny his own inscrutable power\na person deludes himself and says, &quot;Tell me, te=\r\nll me what is this power?\nWhere is it?&quot;\n\n    A brahmin boy, one day, went t=\r\no meet his friends in a students&#39;\nhostel. That being the festival day of Ho=\r\nli, the boy&#39;s friends were\npreparing &#39;Thandai&#39;- a cool drink in which a bit=\r\n of opium is also added.\nIn order to tease him they gave him a strong dose =\r\nof the opium drink.\nThe boy not being used to it, gupled it down somehow, u=\r\nnable to refuse\nhis friends&#39; offer. As the opium started having effect on h=\r\nim, he\nthought of going home. He felt that he could not go alone, so he sta=\r\nrted\nshouting, &quot;Take me home! Take me home!&quot; Now he was under the full\ninfl=\r\nuence of the intoxicant, and he shouted even more loudly, &quot;Take me\nhome! Ta=\r\nke me home!&quot;\n\n   Then one of his friends took pity on him. He led him home =\r\nand made him\nlie down on his bed. Not realising where he was, the boy conti=\r\nnued\nshouting, &quot;Take me home!&quot; Hearing his meaningless shouts, his parents\n=\r\nrushed to is bedside. They tried to tell him that he was already at\nhome. B=\r\nut the boy would not stop his blabbering. Suspecting some\nmischief, the fat=\r\nher questioned his friend and found out that he was\nunder the intoxicating =\r\ninfluence of opium. He then fetched some\nbuter-milk which is an antidote an=\r\nd made him drink it. When he had drunk\nthe butter-milk, the boy, in time, s=\r\ntarted coming to his senses. But he\ncontinued shouting, &quot;Take me home!&quot; Aft=\r\ner some time, he became fully\nconscious that he was reclining in his own be=\r\nd, shouting, &quot;Take me\nhome!&quot; In a flesh he realised how folish he was, that=\r\n there was no need\nfor him to shout, for he was already home. so he stopped=\r\n shouting and\nthereafter, slept peacefully.\n\nSimilarly, we, at the moment, =\r\nunder the influence of the opium of\navidya-&#39;non-apprehension&#39; of reality, c=\r\nonsider ourselves to be the\nbody-mind-intellect and are supremely confused =\r\nby the objects perceived,\nemotions felt and thoughts entertained. We cry ou=\r\nt, &quot;O Lord! O Teacher!\nTake me home. Give me peace. Make me happy!&quot; Take yo=\r\nu where? Give you\nwhat? In Reality you are the self, but due to avidya, you=\r\n live and\nbehave as though you are an ego.\n\nTake me to myself. Give me my o=\r\nwn self. You are already in Om, which is\nyour home. Your home is really Om.=\r\n Never were you out of Om, your home.\nHurry home! Hari Om!\n\nYou ask, &quot;Then =\r\nwhy am i sufering?&quot; All on account of this opium, the\n*Avidya*, which is wi=\r\nthin you. The Guru, the Teacher, will give you the\nbutter-milk of the &#39;stud=\r\ny of the Shastras&#39;, &#39;Spiritual discipline&#39;, etc.\nAll these for what? To tak=\r\ne you home which is Om, where you already are.\n\nLack of correct thinking pr=\r\noduces misconceptions. Think rightly. All\nmisery will end. The text that te=\r\naches us to think correctly and\ndiscriminate properly is the Vivekchoodaman=\r\ni, the\nCrest-Jewel-of-Descrimination.\n\n------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------&#92;\n-------------------------------------=\r\n------\n\nOm Tat Sat\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\r\n--4-7379573497-8099015746=:8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Freinds,&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I quote here the Extract from swami Chinmayananda&#39;s book=\r\n - &#39;Talks on Sankara&#39;s Vivekchodamani&#39;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Intrested ones will get a cle=\r\nar idea of the peerless Shankaracharya&#39;s teachings just by going thro&#39; foll=\r\nowing extract.
