Now it happened so that Mr. VS cou=\r\nld not repay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses=\r\n and many dates but fails and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is under=\r\n great pressure due to that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react in =\r\nthe situations:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act He ca=\r\nn-\n&gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort=\r\n to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external =\r\nactivities concerning that issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this case, He strongly identifies=\r\n with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; OR\n&gt; \n&gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the impl=\r\nementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was =\r\na Rina which needed to be paid back and practically starts training the min=\r\nd with that knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude of=\r\n detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is extreme=\r\nly concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that i=\r\nt was a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they w=\r\nere Money of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come back, sh=\r\ne will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas then the=\r\ny will not come back.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will n=\r\not Create New Rinas and will be able to break free from this particular cha=\r\nin. He may have successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the first Approa=\r\nch, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly with Money and its ownershi=\r\np and hence all the actions done due to that, so He may have created NEW RI=\r\nNAS which will be needed to settled on a later date.\n&gt; \n&gt; However I am not =\r\nsure for what I have written.

As time goes on, the=C3=82=C2=A0thing in your mind which thinks o=\r\nf sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(or male as=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0may be the case)=C3=82=C2=A0body is like a landscape picture just =\r\nlike any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor =\r\nWat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly=C3=82=C2=A0feel tha=\r\nt the picture=C3=82=C2=A0is very beautiful=C3=82=C2=A0but you need not be a=\r\nroused by it).

The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once o=\r\nne *fully* understands and appreciates it.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Chandipath =\r\nconsists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought, which e=\r\nxplain how one can fight and overcome various weaknesses that typically bin=\r\nd one in Maayaa.

It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the na=\r\nmes of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=82=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see=\r\n anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifest=\r\nations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is perman=\r\nent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; wh=\r\nile carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord =\r\nRama is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind one=\r\nself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is=\r\n real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate=\r\n truth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly gre=\r\nat thing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we te=\r\nll ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are t=\r\nemporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on tempor=\r\nary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to g=\r\net it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems=\r\n beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusi=\r\nons. Only the Lord is real.

Let the mind not dwell on temporary il=\r\nlusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam sat=\r\nya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (=\r\ninstead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good =\r\nand bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to=\r\n find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;a=\r\nll is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it p=\r\nractically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only =\r\npermanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat frui=\r\nt but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C3=82=C2=A0Bu=\r\nt, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self=\r\n in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation=\r\n of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces w=\r\nith disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the =\r\nimpermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful A=\r\nghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact th=\r\nat he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel any kind =\r\nof disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He=\r\n chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self an=\r\nd I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual =\r\nand not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell=\r\n on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooke=\r\nd brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on=\r\n the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora =\r\nare telling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into =\r\nevery thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situ=\r\nation where failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact=\r\n work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a=\r\n person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Se=\r\nlf&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to=\r\n absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on=\r\n the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the=\r\n big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwell=\r\ns on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that fail=\r\nure results in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succee=\r\nding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessar=\r\nily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyon=\r\ne trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someo=\r\nne is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakne=\r\nss for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thought=\r\ns in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sad=\r\nhana.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy an=\r\nd keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for ov=\r\nercoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distrac=\r\nt one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that =\r\nthe fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, ho=\r\nw to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root caus=\r\ne and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex =\r\nas two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine=\r\n them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an agho=\r\nra sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his j=\r\napam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think =\r\nthat his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam=\r\n like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. =\r\nHe may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer f=\r\neel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may =\r\nbe broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer =\r\nevoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts=\r\n related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser\n&gt;  an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they =\r\nmay now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in me=\r\nditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may=\r\n feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s f=\r\nascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts w=\r\ne are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these struct=\r\nures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is al=\r\nso possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for se=\r\nx and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking o=\r\nf meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/since=\r\nre/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weakness=\r\nes head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal pers=\r\non may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low sta=\r\nkes.

Aghora is merely a practical w=\r\nay to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up=\r\n a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and =\r\nmany may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction f=\r\nor it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding b=\r\nrings.=C3=82=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though =\r\nit *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic =\r\ntenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to a=\r\nccelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure =\r\nvery unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good =\r\nanalogy for various spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

Its pu=\r\nrpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L=\r\nalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mothe=\r\nr who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who i=\r\ns stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictne=\r\nss). Both are valid paths.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10,=\r\n nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: nagraj@=\r\nsbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Ho=\r\nmam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Friday, =\r\nFebruary 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nam very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You a=\r\nlso wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi hom=\r\nam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? =\r\nAlso, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapa=\r\nthi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pacha=\r\nkshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minut=\r\nes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, =\r\nthat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with h=\r\nomam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please expl=\r\nain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to le=\r\narn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in =\r\nSri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krit=\r\nhis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The=\r\n INTERNET now has a personality.
