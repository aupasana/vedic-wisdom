Your selfless effort in clearly=\r\n explaining it is much appreciated..\n\n Thank you,\n\nSundeep\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; I believe that your observation is correct, but i am afraid your diag=\r\nnosis is wrong.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The five elements exist at various levels and serve v=\r\narious purposes. Mapping them to horoscope is not straight-forward.\n&gt;  \n&gt; M=\r\naharsahi Parasara advised homam for all kinds of planetary problems. One ca=\r\nn do homam irrespective of one&#39;s horoscope and worrying about whether it wi=\r\nll &quot;play up the agni-tattwa and related planets&quot; in the horoscope. Moreover=\r\n, a fire ritual and a tarpana were an integral part of the daily ritual of =\r\nlearned men not so long ago. They are safe for anybody.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Homam done to a soumya devata (gentle deity) such as Ganapathi=\r\n, Lakshmi, Lalita, Krishna, Jupiter etc has some differences in the way it =\r\nworks, compared to homam done to an ugra devata (fierce/tough deity) such a=\r\ns Chandi, Kaali, Durga, Rudra, Mrityunjaya, Narasimha, Mars etc. (Deities m=\r\nay have both forms - like Hanuman - and it depends on which mantra you use =\r\nand which form you are consciously or sub-consciously addressing.)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Le=\r\nt me give an example. My wife Padmaja teaches various shlokas (Ganesha Panc=\r\nharatnam, Aaditya hridayam, Subrahmanyaashtakam, Naama Raamaayanam, Hanumaa=\r\nn Chaalisa, Navagraha stotram, Ganapathi Atharva Seersham, Sri Suktam, Ling=\r\naashtakam etc and now Vishnu sahasra naama stotram) to kids in the neighbor=\r\ngood on Sunday evenings. Though she is fun-loving and has fun with children=\r\n, she is very strict and harsh when it comes to learning. When my sister-in=\r\n-law teaches kids, she is gentle and gives a lot of leeway to kids. But my =\r\nwife is tough, forceful and strict in disciplining them. So all the kids ar=\r\ne very alert and learn much faster with her. There may be moments when they=\r\n experience some fear or even cry when she looks at them angrily, but they =\r\nprogress much faster.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, soumya devatas are gentle in cleansi=\r\nng and bringing transformation and progress can be slow. Ugra devatas are s=\r\ntrict and tough and progress is faster.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn one does homam, the deity burns some of the blocking karmas of the person=\r\n and brings positive karmas to fruition. Over time, this results in good de=\r\nvelopments in life and also cleansing, purification and eventual transforma=\r\ntion of inherent nature.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose you are removing some rotten fruits =\r\nat the top of a basket and throwing them in garbage, in order to extract a =\r\ngood fruit stuck under them. If you do it slowly, it will be fine. But, if =\r\nyou are in a hurry and do it too fast, a little bit of rotten stuff can spi=\r\nll over the floor.\n&gt;  \n&gt; While soumya devatas are gentle and work slowly, u=\r\ngra devatas are harsh and work fast. Any trouble you experience when doing =\r\nugra devata sadhana is like the rotten pieces spilled on the floor. But rem=\r\nember that the good fruit will be taken out faster in this approach.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nThis applies to all sadhanas of ugra devatas and not just homam, but homam =\r\nis an accelerated form of sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Those who can accept anything thro=\r\nwn at them by the chosen deity with a sense of surrender and without expect=\r\nations can worship ugra devatas in fire and progress fast. But, those who w=\r\nant to go slower may want to stick to soumya devatas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In general, I recommend Mahaganapathi homam in the beginning for=\r\n a few months atleast, before one starts another homam. If major blocking k=\r\narmas are cleared by Ganapathi carefully and gracefully, one can think of f=\r\nast track with another deity. That is the safest approach. The importance o=\r\nf Ganapathi sadhana before other sadhanas cannot be over-emphasized. It app=\r\nlies to homam too!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; A gentle deity cannot te=\r\nll Mrityu (Death personified): &quot;go away&quot;. Only a fierce deity can do so. Mr=\r\nityunjaya mantra is for Mrityunjaya, a very fierce form of Shiva who scares=\r\n away even Death (e.g. story of Markendeya). Even if you say Sadashiva in t=\r\nhe sankalpam, it will be Mrityunjaya who comes into fire if you use Mrityun=\r\njaya mantra. He eventually makes you self-realized and immortal (deathless)=\r\n, but he has his aggressive way of going about doing it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you were =\r\nsimply doing a homam to Sadashiva using panchakshari mantra (with or withou=\r\nt hreem), a gentle form of Shiva would come and results would be different.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you want to get rid of the negative effect and yet continue homam=\r\n, there are several options. One is to switch to another mantra such as pan=\r\nchakshari. Another is to use a samputa to ask Mrityunjaya to *protect* whil=\r\ne giving spiritual progress. The samputa &quot;om jum sah&quot; at the beginning and =\r\n&quot;sah jum om&quot; at the end can be used. This version is also there in Shiva ho=\r\nmam manual. Third option is to do a half-hour Mahaganapathi homam for a few=\r\n months and then switch to Mrityunjaya.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, your experience suggests=\r\n to me that there is a spark and good potential in you. Also, my intuition =\r\ntells me that Shiva is basically correct for you, though some more fine-tun=\r\ning may be needed. I hope the Mother takes good care of you and your spirit=\r\nual sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One word on Homam vs Tarpana. =\r\nIn homam, you are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you a=\r\nre calling pitris and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to =\r\nall people irrespective of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery=\r\n signs/planets in their horoscope.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In homam, devatas come in fire and=\r\n burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water =\r\nand free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically i=\r\nnherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who =\r\nwas lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ances=\r\ntor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts=\r\n due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the w=\r\neaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebir=\r\nth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new b=\r\nody, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your c=\r\nonsciousness. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, =\r\nwhile homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very import=\r\nant sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Devatas are very subtle forms of=\r\n consciousness. Their self-identification is to what is known as soul and r=\r\nepresented by Sun. They work on your individual soul and free it from the k=\r\narmas it carries. Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness with strong att=\r\nachments and desires. Their self-identification is with what is known as mi=\r\nnd and represented by Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated w=\r\nith Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Devas and pitris=\r\n have different ways of working and influencing us and helping our spiritua=\r\nl progress. Both are relevant to all of us and have a role to play in our s=\r\npiritual evolution.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- vedicas=\r\ntrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n used your Homam manual to do the Mahamrityunjaya mantra.
