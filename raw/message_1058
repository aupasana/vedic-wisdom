But please \n&gt; note that \n&gt; &gt; Sansk=\r\nrit is not like English and each symbol has a unique \n&gt; pronunciation. If \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; you pronounce correctly, that symbol is pronounced identically \n&gt; (as &quot;=\r\nva&quot;) in \n&gt; &gt; both words. If you really want it to be &quot;v&quot; (without a), it \ns=\r\nhould \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; written differently (as at the end of 3rd and 6th words in=\r\n the \n&gt; picture).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please go through the six examples carefully to =\r\nknow how to write \n&gt; things in \n&gt; &gt; Devanagari correctly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomli=\r\nne: Things like &quot;Raam&quot; or &quot;Shiv Uvaach&quot; are wrong and \nmean \n&gt; nothing \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n in Sanskrit.

There was one remote tem=\r\nple in BriahdDwaraka that had \na \n&gt; nice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of spiritual vibration=\r\ns. It is a temple of Hanuman and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) togethe=\r\nr. Apparently some yogi did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intense sadhana there for a few decades i=\r\nn the past (with the \n&gt; mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you mentioned). The mantra above is wr=\r\nitten all over the walls \nof \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Though that=\r\n yogi is not there now, the vibrations created by \nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana are st=\r\nill there. We were quite impressed when we spent \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time there. =\r\nYou have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BrihadDwaarakaa and t=\r\nhen go inside the village (a few km from \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; main Krishna temple at =\r\nBrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small \ntemple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without any crowd, but h=\r\nas stronger spiritual energy than many \n&gt; famous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temples. If any of y=\r\nou go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend visiting that tem=\r\nple and spending a couple of hours \n&gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The mantra you g=\r\nave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimh=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n--=\r\n\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagann=\r\nath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; --------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n--\n&gt; - \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual \navailable \n&gt;=\r\n now\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   |om|\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one quest=\r\nion \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advis=\r\ned me to go \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for lifting up th=\r\ne Mangal \nin \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha i=\r\nn rasi and \n&gt; neecha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in=\r\n Sri Veetirundha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked=\r\n the priest \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra insc=\r\nribed on the \n&gt; walls of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| =\r\nwhich comes out to \nbe \n&gt; a 7\n&gt; &gt; &gt; word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from t=\r\nhe 7th house to the 10th \n&gt; house\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the mantra devata sitting in l=\r\nagna as per mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every even=\r\ning since.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Later I came to know this is the Rama tar=\r\naka mantra. My \n&gt; question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is how does this mantra help to counter th=\r\ne rajabhanga of \nMangal?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Secondly what is the correc=\r\nt form of the Rama taraka mantra? \n&gt; Is it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri r=\r\nam jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   or=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, =\r\n14 \naksharas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Some say it should be 13 aksharas....\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Sorry for astrological content in this mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Hari\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
