And had a thought in mind `Can I perform&quot;. By that time I was in =\r\nuse of  alcoholic drinks and smoking. Since I had a strong desire of perfor=\r\nming homam,=85. My  gurus started-off transforming me. Let me put step by s=\r\ntep of Guru Krupas below:\n\n\n=95\tI use to booze& smoke daily- since I had th=\r\ne desire of performing homam, I was able to quit abruptly even without the =\r\nfeeling of having it later again, whereas earlier I couldn&#39;t even get into =\r\nsleep without boozing  =96 Don&#39;t you think this is Guru Krupa ?\n\n=95\tI was =\r\ntransferred to  another location of my Company in Chennai, Where my train c=\r\nommuting has increased an hour. I got a good chance to read/byheart homam m=\r\nantras - Don&#39;t you think this is Guru Krupa ?\n\n=95\tI am quite novice of San=\r\nskrit mantras =96day by day  I became thorough and understood the logic in =\r\nbyhearting mantras before I started homam.Very Initially I use to refer man=\r\nual at some areas while performing homam, Sooner my proficiency increased- =\r\nDon&#39;t you think this is Guru Krupa ?\n\n=95\tI use to worried about Ghee and i=\r\nt&#39;s quality, Suddenly one day I saw a women in my apartment selling pure CO=\r\nW GHEE, She gives me cow  ghee less than the cost of gingely oil .- Don&#39;t y=\r\nou think this is Guru Krupa ?\n\n=95\tI use to worried about Samidhas,Cow dung=\r\n and dry coconuts etc.. =96 I found a very nice shop near to my place where=\r\n they sell all ayurvedic herbs and homam items for a cheaper price (even Po=\r\nwder of all herbs used for homam, Wick made by lotus etc..)- Don&#39;t you thin=\r\nk this is Guru Krupa ?\n\n=95\tI use to worried about tying up the dharbha as =\r\nPavitram =96 I found an old bramhin near by my house who has tied 100 pavit=\r\nrams for me at once- Don&#39;t you think this is Guru Krupa ?\n\nThere are many m=\r\nore to list.. I am (we are) really blessed to have have gurus like Narshima=\r\n &Manish. I sincerely thank Gurus Narahima and Manish for helping us in spi=\r\nritual progress. We wish them all the success in their future endeavors.\n\n\n=\r\n\nThank you,\nSrini. \n\n\n\n"}}
