Apologies if i=\r\nt has\n&gt; already been answered and I have missed it in the archives.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne question is, during the ritual, where should the water being placed into =\r\nthe palm be allowed to\n&gt; fall?  Is it okay for it to simply fall on the flo=\r\nor (I am thinking in particular of the case where\n&gt; one is doing it on a ba=\r\nlcony or terrace) or should it be collected and then disposed of into the\n&gt;=\r\n earth later?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindest regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Samir\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
