That way, spiritual greats do add to our spiritual progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bu=\r\nt the problem comes when we read this here, that there, jump to hasty \n&gt; co=\r\nnclusions without understanding the nuances and subtleties, and make \n&gt; dam=\r\nning judgments on the &quot;maturity&quot; of greats.
