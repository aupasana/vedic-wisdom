I have already implemented s=\r\nome of the recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam T=\r\nva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot; from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIn the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians speak Hindi=\r\n, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;=\r\nKrishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a =\r\nconsonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel. But fo=\r\nr whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that=\r\n habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the North Ind=\r\nian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govi=\r\nndam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which so=\r\nunded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj B=\r\nhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is mo=\r\nre important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also w=\r\nithout proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that ap=\r\nproach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana Saroja\n raj=\r\na&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saro=\r\nj raj&quot;.

In fact, we have a lot of people wh=\r\no can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;expe=\r\nrience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on c=\r\norrect pronunciation and point out some common errors.

On the other hand, if you are open to =\r\nchanging your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and ad=\r\nopt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Take the &quot;=\r\nt&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sah=\r\nasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. =\r\nThey change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is =\r\na reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nev=\r\nertheless.\n&gt; \n&gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/=\r\nakshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound =\r\nat the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas,=\r\n changes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experienc=\r\ne something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience th=\r\ne mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Akshara means &quot;unperi=\r\nshed&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you ha=\r\nve just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is =\r\nkshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; a=\r\ns is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and th=\r\ne listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life forc=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;=\r\nt&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has=\r\n the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhanda=\r\ns, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; co=\r\nrrectly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said=\r\n &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but o=\r\ntherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient=\r\n sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; \n&gt; This makes people =\r\nadd some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sou=\r\nnd in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly=\r\n audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pro=\r\nbably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; g=\r\nets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students=\r\n would not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought the ma=\r\nntra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation=\r\n. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paath=\r\nthu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. =\r\nYou don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds=\r\n for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; What I said about words ending =\r\nin consonants applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is mor=\r\ne commonly encountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also.=\r\n There also, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and e=\r\nnd up changing the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. =\r\nThat is also wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;t=\r\nha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; =\r\n(as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of th=\r\na and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is different. I=\r\nt is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound because of=\r\n their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now pronounci=\r\nng tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the o=\r\ndd person out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different sy=\r\nmbols for the same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The l=\r\netters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pr=\r\nonounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/as=\r\npiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; \n&gt; In the sankalpa befor=\r\ne many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaarth=\r\na siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of hu=\r\nman existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama =\r\n(fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end u=\r\np pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It =\r\nmeans &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half at=\r\ntainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in thi=\r\ns sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many many train=\r\ned priests!\n&gt; \n&gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay att=\r\nention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce the=\r\nm differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attenti=\r\non to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; There =\r\nare several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the=\r\n pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in t=\r\nhe next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please give me y=\r\nour consideration and take my input into consideration in altering your pro=\r\nnunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I=\r\n am saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand th=\r\nat. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She ins=\r\npired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are =\r\nSOME who are destined to change their pronunciation based on my views.

So it tough to hear clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This m=\r\nakes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some oth=\r\ner vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana\n and be=\r\ncomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas chan=\r\nges.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot;=\r\n as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to h=\r\near, so that his students would not get confused when learning. Probably th=\r\ne students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used =\r\nto that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standard practice after =\r\na couple of centuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;=\r\npath&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path=\r\n&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be a=\r\ndded at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; What I said about words ending in consonants =\r\napplies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly enc=\r\nountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also.\n There also, =\r\npeople normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changin=\r\ng the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also =\r\nwrong.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One more common mistake is t=\r\nhe sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce thi=\r\ns as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the sy=\r\nmbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is d=\r\nifferent. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound=\r\n because of their inability to see the dot and others started following. No=\r\nw pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly wi=\r\nll be the odd person out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sanskrit is not English. We neve=\r\nr have two different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds for=\r\n the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sound=\r\ns are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or\n &quot;taamra&quot; =3D =\r\ncopper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha =\r\nkaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attain=\r\ning the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling dut=\r\nies), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (develo=\r\nping detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha=\r\n&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha=\r\n&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;hal=\r\nf a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have =\r\nseen it committed by many many trained priests!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you r=\r\nead Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference be=\r\ntween &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see=\r\n &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to\n ensure that you are =\r\nnot confusing tha for dha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There ar=\r\ne several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the p=\r\nronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the=\r\n next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Please=\r\n give me your consideration and take my input into consideration in alterin=\r\ng your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense=\r\n in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can und=\r\nerstand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, becau=\r\nse She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that =\r\nthere are SOME who are destined to change their pronunciation based on my v=\r\niews. That is why I am writing these mails.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you do not =\r\nlike this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_=\r\nblank&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targ=\r\net=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOC=\r\nKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-270623942-1302268624=:13741--\r\n\n"}}
