Glory to all of them! Among the lat=\r\ner sannyasins, Sage Vidyaranya ranks the foremost. He kept up the light of =\r\nAdvaita even in the midst of political bloodshed and suffering in the count=\r\nry. Next to Shankara and his direct disciples, none is so famous in the his=\r\ntory of sannyasa and Vedanta as Swami Vidyaranya, the disciple of Swami Sha=\r\nnkarananda. The commentary on the Bhagavad Gita written by Shankarananda is=\r\n a boon to the sannyasins. It is specially meant for the sannyasins. It is =\r\npurely a sannyasic interpretation of the Gita. \n\n\n"}}
