Suddenly one of the visitors started weeping bitterly.\n\n&#39;I am=\r\n a horrible sinner. For a long time I have been coming to you, but\nthere is=\r\n no change in me. Can I become pure at last? How long am I to wait?\nWhen I =\r\nam here near you, I am good for a time. But when I leave this place,\nI beco=\r\nme a beast again. You cannot imagine how bad I can be -- hardly a\nhuman bei=\r\nng. Am I to remain a sinner forever?&#39;\n\n&#39;Why do you come to me? What have I =\r\nto do with you?&#39; demanded Bhagavan.\n&#39;What is there between us that you shou=\r\nld come here and weep and cry in\nfront of me?&#39;\n\nThe man started moaning and=\r\n crying even more, as if his heart were breaking.\n\n&#39;All my hopes of salvati=\r\non are gone. You were my last refuge and you say you\nhave nothing to do wit=\r\nh me! To whom shall I turn now? What am I to do? To\nwhom am I to go?&#39;\n\nBhag=\r\navan watched him for some time and said, &#39;Am I your Guru that I should\nbe r=\r\nesponsible for your salvation? Have I ever said that I am your Master?&#39;\n\n&#39;I=\r\nf you are not my Master, then who is? And who are you, if not my Master?\nYo=\r\nu are my Guru. You are my guardian angel. You must take pity me and\nrelease=\r\n me from my sins!&#39;\n\nHe started sobbing and crying again.\n\nWe all sat silent=\r\n, overcome with pity. Only Bhagavan looked alert and\nmatter-of-fact.\n\n&#39;If I=\r\n am your Guru, what are my fees? Surely you should pay me for my\nservices.&#39;=\r\n\n\n&#39;But you won&#39;t take anything,&#39; cried the visitor. &#39;What can I give you?&#39;\n=\r\n\n&#39;Did I ever say that I don&#39;t take anything? And did you ever ask me what y=\r\nou\ncan give me?&#39;\n\n&#39;If you would take, then ask me. There is nothing I would=\r\n not give you.&#39;\n\n&#39;All right. Now I am asking. Give me. What will you give m=\r\ne?&#39;\n\n&#39;Take anything. Everything I have is yours.&#39;\n\n&#39;Then give me all the go=\r\nod you have done in this world.&#39;\n\n&#39;What good could I have done? I have not =\r\na single virtue to my credit.&#39;\n\n&#39;You have promised to give. Now give. Don&#39;t=\r\n talk of your credit. Just give\naway all the good you have done in your pas=\r\nt.&#39;\n\n&#39;Yes, I shall give. But how does one give? Tell me how the giving is d=\r\none\nand I shall give.&#39;\n\n&#39;Say like this: &quot;All the good I have done in the pa=\r\nst I am giving away\nentirely to my Guru. Henceforth I have no merit from it=\r\n nor have I any\nconcern with it.&quot; Say it with your whole heart.&#39;\n\n&#39;All righ=\r\nt, Swami. &quot;I am giving away to you all the good I have done so far,\nif I ha=\r\nve done any, and all its good effects. I am giving it to you gladly,\nfor yo=\r\nu are my Master and you are asking me to give it all away to you.&#39;\n\n&#39;But th=\r\nis is not enough,&#39; said Bhagavan sternly.\n\n&#39;I gave you all I have and all y=\r\nou asked me to give. I have nothing more to\ngive.&#39;\n\n&#39;No, you have. Give me =\r\nall your sins.&#39;\n\nThe man looked wildly at Bhagavan, terror stricken.\n\n&#39;You =\r\ndo not know, Swami, what you are asking for. If you knew, you would not\nask=\r\n me. If you take over my sins, your body will rot and burn. You do not\nknow=\r\n me, you do not know my sins. Please do not ask me for my sins.&#39;\n\nHe wept b=\r\nitterly.\n\n&#39;I shall look after myself. Don&#39;t you worry about me,&#39; said Bhaga=\r\nvan. &#39;All I\nwant from you is your sins.&#39;\n\nFor a long time the bargain would=\r\n not go through. The man refused to part\nwith his sins. But Bhagavan was ad=\r\namant.\n\n&#39;Either give me your sins along with your merits, or keep both and =\r\ndon&#39;t\nthink of me as your Master.&quot;\n\nIn the end the visitor&#39;s scruples broke=\r\n down and he declared, &#39;Whatever sins\nI have done, they are no longer mine.=\r\n All of them and their results, too,\nbelong to Ramana.&#39;\n\nBhagavan seemed to=\r\n be satisfied. &#39;From now on there is no good nor bad in\nyou. You are just p=\r\nure. Go and do nothing, either good or bad. Remain\nyourself. Remain what yo=\r\nu are.&#39;\n\nA great peace fell over the man and over us all. No one knows what=\r\n happened\nto the fortunate visitor, for he was never seen in the ashram aga=\r\nin. He\nmight have had no further need to come.\n\nSource: From the Krishna Bh=\r\nikshu chapter in The Power of the Presence, Part\nThree, by David Godman\n\n--=\r\n \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13a7280521b047d078756\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIt was a summer evening, and we were all sitting outside in the =\r\nopen space by the well.
