Yes, the Chandi is a siddha text. Siddha in the sens=\r\ne of being &quot;accomplished for Self realization&quot; as well as &quot;siddhis&quot;, depend=\r\ning on the inclination and capacity of the sadhaka and of course Her will.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; To understand why it is so, one has to do sadhana and keep praying to =\r\nHer. Intellectual comprehension falls flat beyond a point. It is plain usel=\r\ness.=C2=A0And the sadhana is not a one day/few months/one year or few years=\r\n process. It is=C2=A0like an endless ocean, there are simply no limits exce=\r\npt for the ones you set for yourself in your own mind.
