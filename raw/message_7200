So you can \ntell others who are used to blow o=\r\nff lights, that light is an indication of \nenergy spread from the Lord to u=\r\ns, in the same way we get energy from the SUN to \nthe entire world. Hence w=\r\ne should never put it off. It does not signify the \nyears passed by this bi=\r\nrthday.We do not want to wipe off the past life. But we \nwant to review wha=\r\nt we were before and what positive amends do we now add to the \npresent new=\r\n year. it is not hurting any one race or religion, but we need to \nexplain =\r\nrelevant information so as to make them understand the science behind. \nWe =\r\ndo not want to convince them to do like what we do. But just accept what we=\r\n \ndo in our home as not hurting them.\n\nSo what you suggested may not be tho=\r\nught off as an alternative.We can never \nstart afresh every year by ignorin=\r\ng all we have done in the past continuously.\n\nI shall try to tell you the T=\r\nithi and star.\nIn Nirayana system, the birth chart is drawn for the date, t=\r\nime and place of \nbirth details. it gives the placement of all planets and =\r\nwhat are called houses. \nThe relative positioning and aspects between the p=\r\nlanets indicate the video of \nour life. This is because one is destined to =\r\ntake birth on a designed day, time \nand place and also to a particular pare=\r\nnts, so that he will have the life \nblended with awards and rewards, happin=\r\ness, punishments, sufferings etc  based \non the sum total of all the good a=\r\nnd bad deeds done by him in the entire past \nlife in so many thousands of l=\r\nives, taken together and brought forward in every \nbirth.\nHowever, if one c=\r\nhooses to better his life, one can clue from his astrological \nchart and am=\r\nend his activities, make use of good traits offered by the planets, \ntaking=\r\n care in worse situations. care means living in a system of rules and \nregu=\r\nlations. We tend to suffer mainly because of unruly acts, unlimited \nactivi=\r\nty, laziness, selfishness, and hurried doings and short cut doings. This \ni=\r\nndiscipline the planet SATURN does not allow.o it gives a check b way of an=\r\n \nobstacle or punishment. Bur we fail to understand this good work and try =\r\nto \ncontinue our mistakes with out getting transformed.\n\nSo Birth Tithi in =\r\nthis chart is the placement of SUN and Moon, i.e. the \ndifference between t=\r\nhe longitudes of Sun and Moon gives the Tithi. Star or \nNakshatra is the lo=\r\nngitude of MOON alone. Hence Tithi is reflected by the two \nimportant plane=\r\nts Sun and Moon.\nYou need to possess little Astro knowledge to further appr=\r\neciate this.\n\nI shall provide the MANTRAS that give the blessings I referre=\r\nd earlier.\nLet us not be afraid of others when we want to go by a path of D=\r\nHRMA with well \nestablished Rules and Regulations and also Advises.\nYou can=\r\n plan to celebrate the Birthday on 29th September, so that that will \nestab=\r\nlish her date of birth for record too in photographs, Videos and news.\n\nYou=\r\n need not subscribe to what ever told by me. Have your own discretion and a=\r\nct \nin a convinced and bold manner.\nLove and Blessings from Uncle KBKM.\n\n\n\n=\r\n________________________________\nFrom: Vani Sankar &lt;pathumai@...&gt;\nTo:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com; kbk_murthi@...\nSent: Fri, 26 August, 2=\r\n011 6:44:31 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Birthday Dates\n\n\nDear Sir,\n \ni v=\r\nery glad to read what u have writtien. \n \nmy daughter name is Jayashree.

In South India, birthday is celebrated on the TIDHI. In \n&gt;Tamilnad=\r\nu, I think it is done on the star.\n&gt;Many celebrate on the date.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;THE ID=\r\nEA OF CELEBRATING BIRTHDAY IS TO RE-VIEW WHAT HAS BEEN DONE until this \n&gt;bi=\r\nrthday since birth, and how one should propose to transform future for \n&gt;po=\r\nsitive actions and fulfillment of taking birth as a human being.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Never=\r\ntheless, it has become a fashion and exhibition of status now a days.\n&gt;Most=\r\n important point is it is borrowed from west to lighten candles and to put =\r\n\n&gt;them off blowing air by the birthday person , while all others clap and s=\r\nhout \n&gt;Happy Birthday.\n&gt;This is  a most negative act. In or dharma, one sho=\r\nuld not blow off any light, \n&gt;but only make fire/light and spread light.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;So if a person has completed , say 8 years, do not lighten 8 candles and=\r\n then \n&gt; blow them off. But lighten 9 candles or lights with gingelly oil o=\r\nr cow ghee \n&gt;and cotton threads.This signifies starting of 9th year and inv=\r\niting light and \n&gt;energy for the new year.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you are interested, I sh=\r\nall share a procedure invoking fire/light for having \n&gt;good eye sight,good =\r\nhealth, good children to continue the tradition, 100 years \n&gt;life for  posi=\r\ntive contribution, not to get hatred and jealousy with others, eat \n&gt; toget=\r\nher, live togethe, get strength together, get protected together and \n&gt;alwa=\r\nys include all and never exclude any one from your relationship. These hymn=\r\ns \n&gt;from Veda are very powerful and grant all the above positive traits whe=\r\nn \n&gt;invoked.\n&gt;So the usual  Birthday celebration with cake, blowing off can=\r\ndles,spending huge \n&gt;money, gifts and hungama is not what is expected from =\r\ncelebration of a birthday.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;love and blessings to yourself, husband and=\r\n the baby.\n&gt;Uncle KBKM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n________________________________\n From: Vani S=\r\nankar &lt;pathumai@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Sent: Thu, 25=\r\n August, 2011 3:52:26 PM\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Birthday Dates\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;Goo=\r\nd Day to all,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;my daughter&#39;s bday is on 29th sept.  my relative told =\r\nme to celebrate her bday \n&gt;on 8th sept 11 coz thats when her star is born. =\r\n hence my daughter will be \n&gt;benefitted more of i go to temple n do sm spec=\r\nial prayers.  \n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;as a modern mom, this is new to me.  is this how hindu=\r\ns celebrate bdays?  \n&gt; \n&gt;please enlighten me on how a birthday shld be cele=\r\nbrated.  \n&gt; \n&gt;thanks alot. \n&gt;\n\r\n--0-1099453372-1314331255=:24072\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;lucida console&#39;, sans-serif;font-size:1=\r\n4pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: black; font-family: &#39;lucida console&#39;, sans-serif;=\r\n font-size: 14pt; &quot;&gt;Dear Thalli,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: black; font-fami=\r\nly: &#39;lucida console&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; &quot;&gt;Glad to see your mail.=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;lucida console&#39;, sans-=\r\nserif&quot; size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;It is never good to blow off the light.
