Different traditions have different views on this.\n \nSannyasis in some traditions give up fire. Traditions like Kanchi Kamakoti mutt established by Shankaracharya consider that a sannyasi should not light cooking fire or ritual fire.\n \nBut sannyasis in some traditions worship fire or even maintain a dhuni (*continually* burning sacred fire).\n \nFor example, Totapuri was a sannyasi who gave up everything inlcuding clothes, but he always maintained a sacred fire near him! Totapuri was Ramakrishna&#39;s guru, who initiated Ramakrishna into sannyasa and into Adwaita Vedanta. Though Ramakrishna had spiritual experiences earlier too, it was the coming of Totapuri that triggered Nirvikalpa samadhi and made Ramakrishna&#39;s consciousness soar and stay in a new realm where he could have samadhis and other spiritual experiences at will. Though people may not realize it, the impact of Totapuri on the evolution of Ramakrishna and his disciples later on is of immense importance.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSome people quote SrimadBhagavatam 3.24.42, which describes what Kardama Muni did when he took sannyasa. The verse says that Kardama Muni accepted silence as a vow in order to think of the Supreme Being at all times and that he gave up residence and sacred fire and traveled the globe as a sannyasi. People argue that a sannyasi should give up sacred fire.\n \nIf one is able to contemplate the Supreme Being at all times like Kardama, it is a different matter. But, if a renunciate is unable to be in that state at all times, is it wrong to engage in activities that increase one&#39;s surrender, like fire worship, within one&#39;s means?\n \n*        *        *\n \nOn who is a true sannyasi, an important teaching can be found in BhagavadGita:\n \nanaashritaH karmaphalaM kaaryaM karma karoti yaH .\nsa saMnyaasI ca yogI ca na niragnirna caakriyaH .. 6.1\n \n[Word-by-word Meaning: yaH=One who, karoti=does, karma=actions, kaaryam=that are worthy of being done, anaashritaM=without being motivated by, karmaphalaM=results of actions, sa=he is, saMnyaasI ca=renunciate and, yogI ca=also one who is seeking divine union, na=not, niragnir=one who left sacred fire, ca=and, na=not, akriyaH=one left worthy actions (especially rituals).\n \nTranslation: One who engages in actions that are worth engaging in, without being motivated by their results, i.e. without any concern for their results, is a true sannyasi and a true yogi and not one who has given up sacred fire and worthy actions.]\n \nSome scholars who advocate that sannyasis should give up sacred fire and other rituals interpret the above verse in a round-about fashion. Though language suggests that this is a case of &quot;X and Y are not the criteria as people normally think, but the real criterion is Z&quot;, they think it is a case of &quot;X and Y are not the only criteria, but also Z&quot;.\n \nFirst of all, language suggests the former rather than latter. Moreover, Krishna did not use the simple criteria of leaving family and leaving home, but used the criteria of leaving sacred fire and leaving worthy actions and, in the same breath, added the criterion of engaging in worthwhile actions without thinking of results. So it is clear to me that he means, &quot;people normally think sannyasi is one who left sacred fire and actions, but those are not the correct criteria. One who engages in worthy actions without any attachment to the results is the true sannyasi.&quot;\n \n*        *        *\n \nThus, we have a word from Krishna that throws light on why a sannyasi like Totapuri can maintain a sacred fire or why a sannyasi like Samartha Ramadas can give guidance to a brave king like Shivaji and talk about establishing a Hindu nation.\n \nSitting silently in a corner doing nothing is not necessarily renunciation (sannyasa). Renunciation is engaging in worthwhile actions without any attachment for the results whatsoever. Those sannyasis who do certain things and avoid certain things fearing what the world will say about them ARE getting carried away by the results of their actions and not truly sannyasis. They are merely good people trying to live the life of a sannyasi.\n \nHow does one know what action is a worthy one? One&#39;s conscience tells one that. The voice of conscience is normally feeble. As one listens to one&#39;s conscience that is trying to weigh in on each matter from within, one&#39;s conscience becomes confident and its voice becomes louder and louder. As one keeps listening to one&#39;s conscience and keeps engaging in actions without any attachment to (or fear of or revulsion for) any possible result, not only does the conscience get a louder and louder voice, but one becomes a better and better sannyasi and yogi.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSwami Vivekananda once referred to an incident from the life of Adi Shankaracharya with admiration. Adi Shankaracharya gave a word to his mother that he would visit her in her last days. He indeed visited her when she was breathing her last. As per strict tradition, a sannyasi has no mother, father, siblings, spouse and children. A sannyasi is not allowed to do final rites of parents. Of course, the motivation is that attachment to people should not be allowed to develop within one.\n \nThough Adi Shankara was not attached to his mother (if he was, he wouldn&#39;t have left her in the first place, when she was pleading with him to not take sannyasa at such a young age), his conscience told him he owed it to her to do her final rites. He listened to his conscience and did not worry about the consequences of his actions and the bad name he would get. He went against orthodox tradition, lit her funeral pyre and did her last rites. He was heavily criticized for it by orthodox brahmins, but he did not care at all.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere is a very important lesson in this. Giving up attachment to a person does not mean ignoring a person or behaving as if the person does not exist. If I do something for my wife and expect her to appreciate it or do something else for me, it means I am attached to her. If I do something because my conscience tells me I owe it to her, without expecting her to appreciate it at all and without expecting anything in return, then I am detached. Detachment is not running away from things, people and situations. Detachment is doing what conscience tells you to do to things, people and situations, without any attachment to the result whatsoever.\n \nDetachment is with respect to what you *get* from the world and NOT with respect to you *give* to the world. A true sannyasi and a true yogi does not expect *anything* from anybody and accepts whatever one gets, but does not hesitate to give whatever one can give to others and one feels like giving to others!! Giving is not what makes us stuck, it is taking (or expecting to take something).\n \nFrom that point of view, if a sannyasi worships god in fire for the benefit of the world, it amounts to giving to the world. I see nothing wrong in it. The only thing is that one should do it within one&#39;s means. For example, a sannyasi cannot be picky about what materials to offer and manage with whatever one has. Secondly, a sannyasi should never take a specific sankalpa or should do homas and rituals only for the pleasure of gods and dharma in the world. Apart from the sankalpa formally uttered, one should not thinking of specific results even within the mind. Actually, some of us do homas with that approach even though we are not sannyasis. \n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Can Sanyasis perform yagnas / homas?
