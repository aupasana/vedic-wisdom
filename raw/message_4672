It is by\nfirmly restraining that hub throu=\r\ngh intense self-effort and keen\nintelligence that the whole wheel is brough=\r\nt to a standstill. When the hub&#39;s\nmotion is stopped the wheel does not revo=\r\nlve: when the mind is stilled,\nillusion ceases. One who does not know this =\r\ntrick and does not practice it,\nundergoes endless sorrow; the moment the tr=\r\nuth is seen, behold! the sorrow\ncomes to an end.\n\nThe disease of the percep=\r\ntion of this world-illusion is not cured except\nthrough the mastery of the =\r\nmind. Hence O Rama, abandon all other activities\nlike pilgrimage, gifts and=\r\n austerities, and bring the mind under your\ncontrol for our ultimate good. =\r\nThis world appearance abides in the mind,\neven as there is space within the=\r\n pot; if the pot is broken, the illusory\ndivision of space vanishes and if =\r\nthe mind ceases to be, the concept of a\nworld within the mind also ceases t=\r\no be. Even as an insect trapped within\nthe pot attains freedom of movement =\r\nwhen the pot is broken, you will also\nenjoy freedom when the mind ceases to=\r\n be, along with the world-illusion\ncontained in it.\n\nLive in the present wi=\r\nth your consciousness externalized momentarily, but\nwithout any effort: whe=\r\nn the mind stops linking itself to the past and to\nthe future it becomes no=\r\n-mind. If from moment to moment your mind dwells on\nwhat is and drops it ef=\r\nfortlessly at once, the mind becomes no-mind, full of\npurity. It is only as=\r\n long as the mind continues to be agitated that it\nexperiences diversity of=\r\n its own projection or expansion, even as rain falls\nonly as long as there =\r\nare clouds; and it is only as long as the infinite\nconsciousness limits its=\r\nelf into the finite mind that such agitation and\nexpansion take place. If c=\r\nonsciousness ceases to be the finite mind, then\nknow that the very roots of=\r\n cyclic world-illusion (of birth and death) are\nburnt and there is perfecti=\r\non.\n\n=E2=80=94 The Supreme Yoga,Translated from the Yoga Vasishtha by Swami=\r\n\nVenkatesananda\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2009/?pg=3Ds=\r\nep-oct#article.4\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00c09f88d2998ff47a048ba12619\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nRAMA asked: But, Holy sir, how can one restrain this wheel of co=\r\nsmic illusion which revolves with such tremendous force?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;VASISTHA replied: O Rama, the mind is the hub around =\r\nwhich this vicious cycle revolves, creating delusion in the minds of the de=\r\nluded.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0It is by firmly restraining that hub through intense sel=\r\nf-effort and keen intelligence that the whole wheel is brought to a standst=\r\nill.
