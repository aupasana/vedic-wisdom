Food helps to absorb some of the alcohol and aids the body in digesting it faster. \n\nTry to eat starchy foods to slow down the alcohol absorption. \n\nLimit yourself to less than 1 drink per hour. \n\nTry to alternate your alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic beverages such as water \n\nStick to non-carbonated drinks as carbonation can speed up the alcohol absorption. \n\nTry to avoid sweet drinks (and sugary foods) while you drink. The sweet taste of the drink can make it difficult for you to judge how much alcohol you�re actually consuming.\n  Regds\n  K.V.Vighnesh\n  Chennai.\n  mbl: 9444961820\n  yahoo chat id: kvvighnesh@... \n\n       \n---------------------------------\n Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more.

Food helps to absorb some of the alcohol and aids the body in digesting it faster. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Try to eat starchy foods to slow down the alcohol absorption. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Limit yourself to less than 1 drink per hour. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Try to alternate your alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic beverages such as water &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stick to non-carbonated drinks as carbonation can speed up the alcohol absorption. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Try to avoid sweet drinks (and sugary foods) while you\n drink. The sweet taste of the drink can make it difficult for you to judge how much alcohol you�re actually consuming.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #7f007f; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Regds&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #7f007f; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;K.V.Vighnesh&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #7f007f; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Chennai.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;\n mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #7f007f; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;mbl: 9444961820&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #7f007f; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;yahoo chat id: &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:kvvighnesh@...&quot;&gt;kvvighnesh@...&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#32;\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more.
