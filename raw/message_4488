There are many standard homam procedures =\r\nin the world today, some more elaborate than what we teach and some more br=\r\nief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be happy if m=\r\nore and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of the exact procedu=\r\nre used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any. If yo=\r\nu are initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily, please go=\r\n ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make us very happy. H=\r\nowever, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please consider what I=\r\n taught, which is simple enough to do daily.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSuppos=\r\ne there are rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to one&#39;s pare=\r\nnts, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, d=\r\nessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve various items in those =\r\ncontainers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyd=\r\nay and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few months.\n \nIs that bet=\r\nter or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal=\r\n and serve lunch to parents everyday?\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; 21. I sugge=\r\nst that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity.\n&gt; Hybrids m=\r\nay not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve\n&gt; knowledge=\r\n uncorrupted.\n \nThe only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved witho=\r\nut corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of im=\r\nperishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge.\n \nKnowledge of *external ritu=\r\nals* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-=\r\npaatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.\n \nAt the end of the da=\r\ny, the key is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis=\r\n or not, whether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and w=\r\nhether it helps in one&#39;s spiritual progress or not.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nLet me cut & paste a section from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasi=\r\non. It contains an analogy given earlier and addresses some relevant issues=\r\n.\n \n-----------------------------\nDo Vedas Describe External Rituals\n \nSome=\r\n people believe that Veda describes the specifics about various external ya=\r\ngyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge tha=\r\nt is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific exter=\r\nnal rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?\n \nThough Sayanacharya=E2=80=99=\r\ns celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghos=\r\ne had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His vie=\r\nw is that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not rel=\r\native truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Wil=\r\nl. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everyt=\r\nhing that is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symboli=\r\nzes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions a=\r\nnd desires.\n \nMetaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n \nNotions that so and =\r\nso yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya r=\r\nitual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.=\r\n\n \nOnce there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regula=\r\nrly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in =\r\nAatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems=\r\n [Veda].\n \nAs people started living a little away from the sea [less spirit=\r\nually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to rea=\r\nch the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew =\r\nwith time. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n \nPeople =\r\nstarted moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocke=\r\nd desert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of wa=\r\nter like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of w=\r\nalking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether o=\r\nne had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different sc=\r\nhools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a buil=\r\nding or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea=\r\n!\n \nThen came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse in=\r\nstead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He d=\r\nid find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to r=\r\neach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n \n=\r\nPeople performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this =\r\nhorse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and diffe=\r\nrent from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did no=\r\nt even understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean=\r\n, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea ritua=\r\nls that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original i=\r\nnstructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instr=\r\nuctions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they curr=\r\nently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n \nSlowly many new sets of=\r\n instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths=\r\n to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk toward=\r\ns east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].\n \nOne particular path through =\r\njungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practi=\r\nce of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter thr=\r\nough that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strong=\r\nest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a f=\r\nall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path=\r\n were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, c=\r\nondemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then=\r\n, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path d=\r\nesisted from it.\n \nAs time progressed, people started fighting too much abo=\r\nut whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt th=\r\ne original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-=\r\ncalled &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and change=\r\nd times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not=\r\n reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual g=\r\noal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow t=\r\nhe instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed ge=\r\nographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went =\r\nto sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for=\r\n violating tradition.\n \nIn case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief s=\r\nummary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as A=\r\ngni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different as=\r\npects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realiz=\r\nation. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied sub=\r\njects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definiti=\r\nve and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-realizat=\r\nion itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only r=\r\nelative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends=\r\n on one&#39;s current position!\n \nGreat men in many spiritual paths, within Hin=\r\nduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood th=\r\ne current state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how=\r\n to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions=\r\n and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradicti=\r\nons between paths.\n \nStop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n \nAs the metaphor above il=\r\nlustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. Wh=\r\nat is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic h=\r\nomam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are wheth=\r\ner one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is im=\r\nproving and how one is being transformed internally.\n \nJust as a twenty cou=\r\nrse meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =\r\n=E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or=\r\n a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just a=\r\ns a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy to =\r\none, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99=\r\ns spiritual evolution.\n \nWise Tradeoffs\n \nSuppose the president of the coun=\r\ntry is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can invite all the 1=\r\n00 associates of the President by name and seat them in the room individual=\r\nly, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long pleasantries wi=\r\nth the President and then offer lunch.\n \nSuppose one is in a hurry and has =\r\nvery little time. If one still invites all the 100 associates by name and s=\r\neats them in the room individually following the protocol and does not have=\r\n enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise tradeo=\r\nff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates together and seat them =\r\ntogether by violating the protocol and use that time to let the President e=\r\nat in peace?\n \nSimilarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and=\r\n gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries=\r\n and give more time to eat?\n \nIn a fire ritual, making offerings to the mai=\r\nn deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before the=\r\n offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and o=\r\nfferings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for the =\r\nfire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one ha=\r\ns only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the ben=\r\nefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n \n&lt;sections deleted&gt;\n \nProof of =\r\nthe Pudding\n \nAt this time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to s=\r\nome deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for=\r\n 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some =\r\nbasic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda a=\r\nnd Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.=\r\n The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to perform a short h=\r\nomam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if there is a difference=\r\n in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking.\n----------------=\r\n-------------\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n \n---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt; wr=\r\note: \n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for=\r\n guiding me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to=\r\n a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree t=\r\nhat jHora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have g=\r\none through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a=\r\n homam being performed  and have the following observations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1=\r\n. As per rules laid out by  srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the pre=\r\nocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of th=\r\ne darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps =\r\nin darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist in to=\r\noshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge w=\r\nhich are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas=\r\n and later elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are variations in procedur=\r\nes in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalay=\r\nana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fi=\r\nre wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are=\r\n divinised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedu=\r\nre. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the=\r\n volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance =\r\nof these steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by a=\r\nny of the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a=\r\n mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the=\r\n darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of =\r\nsucceeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra =\r\n&quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. T=\r\nhis can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle star=\r\nting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Pa=\r\ntraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darb=\r\nha is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification =\r\nof the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utens=\r\nils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, v=\r\naruna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13=\r\n. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the hom=\r\na dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purificati=\r\non of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used =\r\n(sruksruvou).\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni =\r\niis missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the=\r\n ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quan=\r\ntity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalop=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; and many more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic=\r\n procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kun=\r\nda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on t=\r\nhe name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga,  agni carries the offering to t=\r\nhe particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or =\r\nnot necessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into=\r\n the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the a=\r\ngni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specifi=\r\ned agni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures a=\r\nre available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) idea=\r\nl for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to s=\r\ntruggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are des=\r\nigned for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easil=\r\ny adapted  to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Homam should not be se=\r\nen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It =\r\ninvolves learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision a=\r\nnd perfection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge=\r\n in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty=\r\n help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
