It just continues the cycle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But what is the =\r\nbig deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continue which =\r\never path one choses, dharma or adharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Without discharging =\r\none&#39;s dharma, Nature will not allow one to attain moksha. Moksha (liberatio=\r\nn) is attained when one is free from desires, attachments, attractions and =\r\naversions. As long as there are some karmik debts that need to be settled, =\r\nNature will keep some attractions and some aversions alive in the person an=\r\nd keep one away from liberation. Thus, there is a big difference between fo=\r\nllowing dharma and not following dharma. While following one&#39;s dharma does =\r\nnot guarantee liberation, not following one&#39;s dharma does guarantee not get=\r\nting liberated and keeps liberation further away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The key to =\r\nmaking spiritual progress is to follow one&#39;s dharma, without identifying wi=\r\nth the actions too much. If one fulfils one&#39;s dharma but identifies with th=\r\ne actions strongly (i.e. has the sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot; and feels proud),=\r\n that creates new karmas and new bondage. Any action or thought performed w=\r\nith a sense of &quot;I&quot; involved in it causes new karmas and new bondage. Each s=\r\nuch action keeps one further away from liberation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course,=\r\n it is difficult to perform actions without a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;. So,=\r\n to start with, atleast remove an action and its doership from your thought=\r\ns once the action is finished. Keep the sense of doership while you do it (=\r\nbecause it helps you do it better), but remove it from your mind once the a=\r\nction is complete. Normally we cling on to the doership of an action for a =\r\nlong time and that creates a strong self-identification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a=\r\nn example, suppose you build a temple. You may do it with a sense of &quot;*I* a=\r\nm doing some important work&quot; while the building work is going on, because t=\r\nhat thought and resultant attachment motivates you overcome problems. But, =\r\nonce the temple is finished, learn to say &quot;krishnaarpanamastu&quot; (surrendered=\r\n to the Lord) and think no more of it as your work or your &quot;achievement&quot;. I=\r\nf people praise you for the great thing you have done, learn to not dwell o=\r\nn it mentally and not feel proud. There may be no need to demonstrate your =\r\nhumility by lecturing or saying something, but, you can just smile and keep=\r\n your mind from dwelling on that compliment and feeling proud.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; We cling on to our good and bad actions for too long, by thinking of them=\r\n (&quot;I did it&quot;) for too long. If we learn to cut off doership in the mind onc=\r\ne the action is finished, that is a great starting point. The next step is =\r\nto not have the sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot; even as one is doing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; If one engages in actions without attachment and without a sense of ow=\r\nnership/doership, one stops accumulating new karmas (new burden). As that h=\r\nappens, one&#39;s conscience becomes stronger and tells one of one&#39;s dharma cle=\r\narer and louder. That enables one to unload the existing karmik burdens (pe=\r\nrform correct dharma) without picking up new burdens (no new actions with s=\r\nelf-identification). That takes one closer to liberation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thu=\r\ns, I emphasize detached action. Being able to engage in action with very li=\r\nttle (or no) attachment and sense of doership is more important and urgent =\r\nthan finding out what one&#39;s dharma is and discharging it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is what his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked hi=\r\nm to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not every &quot;guru&quot; will have a perfect idea of what one=\r\n&#39;s dharma is. As I said, &quot;If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear in=\r\nsight into one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance&quot;. After =\r\nall, one&#39;s dharma depends on what actions one engaged in in the past lives =\r\nwhile identifying with the actions, what karmik debts were created and what=\r\n mental conditioning was created. Those things can be known with certainty =\r\nonly by a guru who is self-realized.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing=\r\n his dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That is theoretically possible, but very unlikel=\r\ny. One who kills tens or hundreds or thousands of people with a sense of &quot;I=\r\n am doing it&quot;, &quot;I am taking revenge&quot;, &quot;I am punishing them&quot;, &quot;I will go to =\r\nheaven because of it&quot; is doing an action with a strong self-identification.=\r\n Whether this act is expected from one by Nature as a result of previous ka=\r\nrmik debts to the victims or not is unknowable, but what we can know for su=\r\nre is that this person has created new karma and new debts. Any action perf=\r\normed with self-identification causes new karma, new debts and new bondage.=\r\n The bondage will pull him in a future life into situations where one will =\r\nbe paid those debts back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nTW, the article of Robert Svoboda given earlier can also be accessed at the=\r\n following &quot;tiny&quot; URL (thanks to Kishore for creating it):\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ht=\r\ntp://tinyurl.com/dblc6a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri=\r\n Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windo=\r\nws): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Se=\r\nnt: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:21 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Nic=\r\ne article on dharma by Robert Svoboda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Namaste\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         I read Svoboda&#39;s article and I had a few question. Theo=\r\nritcal but relevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         He has given the idea of of terro=\r\nrists. When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his =\r\ndharma. That is what he maybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what=\r\n his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked him to do, and that is what his ideals/principl=\r\nes/books maybe asked of him to do. So from teh point of view of dharma, how=\r\n can he be blamed? Therefore, the statement taht &quot;Dharmo rakshati rakshitah=\r\n..&quot;, does not make sense. How is his dharma protecting him? What is he gett=\r\ning in return, other than a bag load of strong karmas to fend off at a late=\r\nr date, when he may not even be aware why he has this karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n        Can there is conflicting Dharmas for one person? Or more important =\r\nvs less important dharma? Swadharma should be situational. Sant Tulsidas&#39;s =\r\n broader dharma may have been realizing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma =\r\nshould have been to keep his wife happy. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can e=\r\nver full perform every dharma that is expected of us. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        =\r\n I believe the reason this idea of Dharma was existent in ancient times, wa=\r\ns mostly because nature has created various kinds of people, each with vary=\r\ning tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or the best =\r\nway to tell men that we are all different and yet we are not incorrect in a=\r\nnyway. This is much better than the new ages philosophies which outright de=\r\nny reality and claim everything and everyone is born equal. It is not so.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         The word religion is a 13 century invention and, etymol=\r\nogically, and inherently competitive in nature. Unlike Dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n         Also, as Narasimhaji&#39;s mail shows correctly, following Dharma is n=\r\no gaurantee of anything, least of all Moksha. It just continues the cycle. =\r\nBut what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way continu=\r\ne which ever path one choses, dharma or adharma. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         A mu=\r\nch better way of conduction life, I feel, is maknig a mental note of Karma.=\r\n To know teh simple truth that that which goes out will come back to you an=\r\nd that, if you had not been bad at some point, nothing bad will ever come t=\r\no you. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a life based on and bein=\r\ng on the right side of karma, is much easier and profitable  than trying to=\r\n find that elusive dharma which anyway won&#39;t help one in the long run.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Just my feeling on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         -Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Narasi=\r\nmha P.V.R.

Rig=\r\nht action varies from person to person, from time to time \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           =\r\n&gt; and from place to place.

The time then was such that there was too much=\r\n weight \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved =\r\nof some weight.

When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;           &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be somethi=\r\nng else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    =\r\n       &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide wha=\r\nt is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Some people have in=\r\nterpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;=\r\n and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long =\r\ntime, the concept of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; caste mobility was very much there.=\r\n Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; killing birds. He bec=\r\name a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; k=\r\nshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;           &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off w=\r\nith the varna \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; of father, because that is what one is exp=\r\nosed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; develops in life, one gets =\r\none&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           =\r\n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know yo=\r\nur \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are =\r\nnot just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; the world. Each person has individ=\r\nual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma =\r\nis is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; enough, o=\r\nne will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n         &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a=\r\n lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell o=\r\nther things. Thus, we get \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;           &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination =\r\nand intuition and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow i=\r\nt sincerely. We may err, but doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; the best we can is al=\r\nl that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; More than following =\r\ndharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; act=\r\nions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n        &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should =\r\nnot build \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We s=\r\nhould engage in the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; possible actions (based on our =\r\nbest judgment on what our dharma in the given \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; situation =\r\nis), with as little attachment and self-identification with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     =\r\n      &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave th=\r\ne result \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what w=\r\nill happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of n=\r\nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; unattached action=\r\n) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma cle=\r\narer. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowl=\r\ny enable us to see our \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma clearly and follow it with=\r\nout incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; but not as d=\r\nifficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; The bottomli=\r\nne is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;    =\r\n       &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in actio=\r\nn with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;      =\r\n     &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; In deciding=\r\n one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One=\r\n can \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is g=\r\niven to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; master. If one surrenders to a s=\r\npiritual master, one can take the words of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; the master to=\r\n determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n         &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought k=\r\nilling gurus \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru=\r\n in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma. When Narendranath =\r\n(Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; and wa=\r\nnted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n           &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay i=\r\nn the material \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and=\r\n does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; debts are and what=\r\n nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;=\r\n one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight in=\r\nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidan=\r\nce.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a s=\r\net of principles and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dha=\r\nrma changes from person to person, from \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; time to time and=\r\n from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of on=\r\ne&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing vario=\r\nus kinds of spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) an=\r\nd engaging in actions without much \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; attachment, one can s=\r\nlowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; o=\r\nne&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     =\r\n      &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n         &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.S=\r\nriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; ----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajite=\r\nn@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;           &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;=\r\n Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Namas=\r\nte to all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora s=\r\neries\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Vimaland=\r\na says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Can somebody sha=\r\nre views on that and how can we approach\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n          &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; jitender\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
