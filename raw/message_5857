Due to the\nfirst delusion, Jiva and God appear to have diffe=\r\nrent forms.\n\nI-14. Due to the second, the attribute of agency dwelling in t=\r\nhe Self\nappears to be real. The third (consists in) deeming the Jiva associ=\r\nated with\nthe three bodies as having attachment.\n\nI-15. The fourth takes th=\r\ne world-cause (God) to be mutable. The fifth\ndelusion ascribes reality to t=\r\nhe world as distinguished from its cause.\nThen, also, in the mind flashes t=\r\nhe cessation of the five-fold delusion.\n\nI-40. Consider in your mind: who a=\r\nm I ? How is all this (brought about) ?\nHow do death and birth (happen) ? T=\r\nhus (considering) will you earn the great\nbenefit (of investigation).\n\nII-8=\r\n-9. The mind that clings not to acts, thoughts, and things, to\nwanderings a=\r\nnd reckonings of time, but reposes in Consciousness alone,\nfinding no delig=\r\nht anywhere, even when turned toward some objects, revels in\nthe Self.\n\nII-=\r\n12. The quiescent state of the attenuated mind, free from all objective\nref=\r\nerence, is said to be the deep sleep in wakefulness.\n\nII-14. Having attaine=\r\nd the indestructible status in this fourth stage, one\nreaches a non-blissfu=\r\nl poise (as it were), its nature being invariably\ndelightful.\n\nII-23. Liber=\r\nation is not on the top of the sky; not in the nether world; not\non the ear=\r\nth. The dwindling of mind in which all desires dry up is held to\nbe liberat=\r\nion.\n\nII-35. Here is the supreme Self whose essence is the light of Conscio=\r\nusness\nwithout beginning or end; the wise hold this luminous certitude to b=\r\ne the\nright knowledge.\n\nIII-7.

How can t=\r\nhe great Yogin, who has dispelled nescience,\nplunge into them ?\n\nIV-7. Only=\r\n influenced by some desire does man work for miraculous powers.\nThe perfect=\r\n man, seeking nothing, can have no desire whatsoever.\n\nIV-8. When all desir=\r\nes dry up, O sage, the Self is won. How can the mindless\n(sage) desire mira=\r\nculous powers ?\n\nIV-12. Dead is his mind who is unmoved in joy and sorrow, =\r\nand whom nothing\njerks out of equality, even as breaths stir not a mighty m=\r\nountain.\n\nIV-16. The nature of mind, know, is folly, O sinless one ! When t=\r\nhat\nperishes one=E2=80=99s real essence, mindlessness, is (won).\n\nIV-26. Th=\r\nat eternally self-shining Light, illuminating the world, is alone\nthe witne=\r\nss of this world, the Self of all, the pure One.\n\nIV-48. Being continuously=\r\n free from latent impressions, when the mind ceases\nto ponder there arises =\r\nmindlessness that yields supreme tranquillity.\n\nIV-79. As long as the laten=\r\nt impressions are not attenuated, the mind is not\ntranquillised; as long as=\r\n the knowledge of truth is not won, whence can come\nmental tranquillity ?\n\n=\r\nIV-80. As long as the mind is not tranquil, Truth cannot be known; so long\n=\r\nas the knowledge of Truth is not won whence can mental tranquillity come ?\n=\r\n\nV-3.
