How ever, they may=\r\n be less popular among vaishnavaites.\n\nHanuman is an avatara of Shiva. I al=\r\nso heard about few other stories where Shivji took human birth to marry Par=\r\nvathi who is born as a girl on earth (Kamakshi?).\n\nHow ever, I am not very =\r\nfamiliar with Shiva&#39;s avataras (excluding Hanuman) that kills a rakshasa. S=\r\nhiva killed many demons himself but mostly as Shiva himself and with out go=\r\ning through an avatara.\n\nThis perhaps is because Shiva being a maha yogi do=\r\nes not need to obey and go through Maya to show his Leela. Vishnu on the ot=\r\nherhand went through Maya and showedf his leela.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Murahari Vadapalli &lt;murahariv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste, \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; In the puranic literature, we mostly come across Vishn=\r\nu(destroyer of Maya)=A0avatara only taking birth to remove ills of human be=\r\nings. Why is it that only the qualities(avatara) of Vishnu are necessary to=\r\n bring about Righteousness on Earth? Why not qualities(avataras) of Shiva (=\r\ndestroyer of tamas) are required or to put it more clearly, why doesn&#39;t pur=\r\nanas mention about Shiva avataras but only Vishnu avataras?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks =\r\n& Regards,\n&gt; --Murahari\n\n\n"}}
