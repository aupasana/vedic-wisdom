That fire can carry various \nauspicious substances to various deities, but does NOT like to carry stuff \nlike alcohol and meat, even if a deity is willing to receive the offering. \nIf you want to offer alcohol to a deity such as Bhairava, call the deity in \nan idol or a kalasha (pot) or in an animal and then make the offering of \nalcohol. But do not use homam fire to make the offering.\n\nAnother type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha (carrier \nof impurities) can be used to carry anything, without restrictions. However, \nthis fire is not used in homam.\n\nA few deities such as Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be worshipped \non a funeral pyre with any materials. However, such rituals are not \nappropriate for 99.99999999% people. Those are only for people who already \nhave a very high level of detachment and a very low level of distinction \nbetween the polarities of duality, i.e. people who have a very low level of \nmental distinction between things normally considered highly pure and things \nnormally considered highly impure and see all as One. As a result of their \nworship on funeral pyre, they may get results that are normally considered \ngood or results that are normally considered terrible, but again their \nmental distinction between good and bad results is very low and they accept \nall results with an equal vision. Rituals practiced by such aghoris are \naimed at honing their detachment and non-distinction to further perfection.\n\nSuch aghora practices are not to be done out of &quot;fascination&quot; or because \nthey seem or sound &quot;cool&quot;. That is a formula for failure and disaster. For \nthe majority of us who are still deeply affected by the polarities of \nduality and cannot see all things equally, worship of any deity in funeral \npyre is a strict no-no. Stick to regular homam and maintain basic purity, no \nmatter which deity you worship in the fire. In that case, throwing chillies, \nmeat and alcohol in fire is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some people do \nnot realize it and throw these things in their homam fire. This is a \nterrible thing to do.\n\nPeople in this age foolishly mix up principles of duality and non-duality. \nPrinciples of non-duality like &quot;all is god&quot; are applicable only if you can \nsee god in pleasure and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and \npain are two distinct feelings for you and you prefer one to the other, then \nyou are immersed in duality and follow the principles of duality without \nmixing up non-dual principles and pretending &quot;all is god&quot;. All is NOT god \nfor you then.\n\nOffering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can bring terrible results to \none. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience the results \nimmediately, but most people do not experience right away. As a result, they \ndo not realize what a terrible thing they are doing. My humble request to \neverybody who performs homam is to stay away from using such taamasik \nmaterials.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 17, 2008 2:38 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; I was seeing a homa being done by a person where alcohol was being\n&gt; offered in the fire.
