If many people are doing homam by themselves today, he playe=\r\nd an important role in it.\n \nWhen Manish wanted to do Shata Chandi Homam, S=\r\nwami Sathasivom invited us to do it at the Kaalikaambaal temple in Chennai =\r\nwhere he is the head priest. When I asked how much it will cost, he said &quot;I=\r\n will arrange everything. You and Manish just come and sit for sankalpam&quot;. =\r\nIt was during the Shata Chandi homam that Manish had a darshan of the Mothe=\r\nr, who commanded to spread homam and said She will arrange all the resource=\r\ns needed. Swami Sathasivom had several books on homam gifted to us by a fri=\r\nend of his on the next day, without Manish telling anything about the Mothe=\r\nr&#39;s command to anyone. He also gifted a homa kundam to me enabling me to ex=\r\nperiment with homam and prepare myself for creating the manuals.\n \nHe is a =\r\npriest in the Sivacharya tradition of Tamil Nadu and his father Sri Sambamu=\r\nrthi Sivacharya was a very respected Sivacharya who trained a lot of priest=\r\ns and consecrated many temples. Swami Sathasivom is one of the rare priests=\r\n we find today, who is not only a priest but also a yogi and a sadhaka. He =\r\nhas childlike innocence, simplicty, rare humility and love for all. He cond=\r\nucts himself with detachment by seeking nothing and avoiding nothing. He co=\r\nnducted some of the best homams and poojas I have witnessed. He has been on=\r\n mouna vratam (vow of silence) for more than a year and communicates by wri=\r\nting (saying mantras in pooja/homam is an exception).\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nI can give an analogy for the last point regarding an aghora&#39;s way to ov=\r\nercome any weakness for sex that may be left in the mind (which may make se=\r\nxual thoughts arise in the mind now and then).\n \nSuppose you are trying to =\r\nread a book and a friend is distracting you and irritating you by talking a=\r\nbout something else. You can try to ignore him and focus on the book. Alter=\r\nnatively, you can also try to get him interested in the book and call him t=\r\no read the book along with you. In the beginning, he may still distract you=\r\n and make it more difficult to read. But, it is possible that he also likes=\r\n the book and starts enjoying the book along with you and stops distracting=\r\n you.\n \nIf meditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is like the =\r\nfriend and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like the distractions=\r\n caused by the friend, then aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting th=\r\ne friend to read the book along with you.\n \nHowever, as I said, there are n=\r\no guarantees. This friend may get interested in the book and stop distracti=\r\nng you, or he may continue to distract you and make it worse by being right=\r\n next to you through the reading. It is tricky to know how long one should =\r\ntry before deciding that it is not working. That is why we say that aghora =\r\nis not for everyone.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    =\r\n Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: swam=\r\nisathasivom@... \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wed=\r\nnesday, February 24, 2010 11:48 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Aghora boo=\r\nks by Svoboda (Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya)\n  Namaskarams  \n\n  This repl=\r\ny is amazing and true \n  Bow down to yr knowledge given by ma durga Mahalak=\r\nshmi .\n  I was stunned by this answers ,its answers to many questions in ou=\r\nr inner mind .\n  I stopped all and read this reply almost 5 th time .each t=\r\nime some new points I am catching from in it ,\n  Nandhi\n\n  Sent from my Bla=\r\nckBerry=AE smartphone\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n\n  From: &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

The idea is that one =\r\nis not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates it.\n\n  =\r\nChandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother foug=\r\nht, which explain how one can fight and overcome various weaknesses that ty=\r\npically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will =\r\npromote the fighting spirit within one that fights these weaknesses.\n\n  The=\r\nre is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it=\r\n at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of t=\r\nhe Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of t=\r\nhe Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mot=\r\nher makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, irr=\r\nespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects of=\r\n a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n\n  *        *        *\n=\r\n\n  &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n  &gt;=\r\n Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n  &gt; Perhaps I=\r\n need to read more! \n\n  Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora=\r\n is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n\n  Ghor=\r\na means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shi=\r\nva is Aghora. A true Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or b=\r\nad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to=\r\n focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead =\r\nof impermanent manifestations of god.\n\n  When someone dies, north Indians c=\r\nhant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It=\r\n means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusi=\r\non&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and death are just a temporary=\r\n illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is: why should we rem=\r\nind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someone p=\r\nraises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and we are about to fee=\r\nl proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thin=\r\ng we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Le=\r\nt the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to som=\r\nething beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam sa=\r\ntya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things that seem not so =\r\nbeautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not =\r\ndwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When someone attacks and abuses us and we ar=\r\ne about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai=\r\n. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind=\r\n not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n\n  A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama =\r\nnaam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* o=\r\nf Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impur=\r\ne, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion) and t=\r\nries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n\n=\r\n  *        *        *\n\n  Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive=\r\n is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are =\r\nboth impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is th=\r\ne Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ri=\r\ntual where feces is eaten. But, please remember that eating feces is not th=\r\ne main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving=\r\n an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point=\r\n. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a pers=\r\non&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) wh=\r\nile eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will n=\r\not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain propertie=\r\ns and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Sel=\r\nf and he is eating Self.\n\n  Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions=\r\n really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I=\r\n am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely b=\r\ne a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his min=\r\nd may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a =\r\nbadly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from t=\r\nhe focus on the permanent (Self).\n\n  Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are tel=\r\nling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every t=\r\nhought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation w=\r\nhere failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work a=\r\ns an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person=\r\n who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and=\r\n eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb=\r\n the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the ni=\r\nce (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big de=\r\nal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on th=\r\ne taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure res=\r\nults in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding qu=\r\nickly.\n\n  However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by ev=\r\neryone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas =\r\nsucceeds.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  Take another simple example. Suppose so=\r\nmeone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a wea=\r\nkness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thou=\r\nghts in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s =\r\nsadhana.\n\n  A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind=\r\n away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such t=\r\nhoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if =\r\none keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination=\r\n in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome t=\r\nhe fascination some minds may have for sex?\n\n  An aghora will take it to an=\r\n extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the=\r\n mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one =\r\npure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such disti=\r\nnctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner si=\r\ntting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may =\r\ntitillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made im=\r\npure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/yea=\r\nrs. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is =\r\ndoing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association =\r\nin his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pict=\r\nures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke =\r\nthoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly ris=\r\ne in the head may not lead to denser and denser thoughts relating to sex an=\r\nd distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation=\r\n. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately,=\r\n the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be b=\r\nroken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be g=\r\none largely.\n\n  Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences a=\r\nnd the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down som=\r\ne of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those=\r\n structures.\n\n  However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is als=\r\no possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex=\r\n and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of=\r\n meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincer=\r\ne/ready to start with.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  Bottomline is that an agho=\r\nra takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight wi=\r\nth them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and=\r\n fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable =\r\nto all.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what=\r\n is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to unders=\r\ntand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stak=\r\nes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may fee=\r\nl aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based =\r\non a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings. Aghor=\r\na stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some p=\r\neople pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Ve=\r\ndanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one abso=\r\nrbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n\n  BTW=\r\n, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and e=\r\nxplains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the context of =\r\naghora.\n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/361\n\n  Best r=\r\negards,\n  Narasimha\n  -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings,\n  &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n       Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n  --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: Nagraj Kota =\r\n\n    To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Thursday, February 18, 201=\r\n0 11:58 AM\n    Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n\n=\r\n          Dear Narasimhagaru,\n\n          Thank you for your reply. \n\n      =\r\n    I understand that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Univ=\r\nersal Mother. But what I am trying to understand is that how to worship bot=\r\nh forms simultaneously. For instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a gr=\r\neat composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyaga=\r\nraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamal=\r\namba Navavarna Krithis mention great details about all the nine avaranas an=\r\nd different forms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana. In=\r\n the Dhyana Krithi of those, in the very first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, =\r\nAsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;. That line tells me that even through Sri Vidy=\r\na one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form. \n\n          So my question was i=\r\nn that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mention=\r\ned how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in thos=\r\ne terms. \n\n          I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get p=\r\nractise of reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I =\r\nplan to do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortabl=\r\ne reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my ta=\r\nrget. \n\n          Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by D=\r\nr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perh=\r\naps I need to read more! \n\n          Nagraj\n\n          --- On Fri, 2/12/10,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n            From: Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n            Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Hom=\r\nam and Sri Vidya\n            To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n            D=\r\nate: Friday, February 12, 2010, 11:31 PM\n\n\n              \n            Namas=\r\nte,\n\n            Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My performi=\r\nng a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other han=\r\nd, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours t=\r\no read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are do=\r\ning Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-insp=\r\niring.\n\n            Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that=\r\n needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or tw=\r\no sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the ti=\r\nme between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig=\r\n 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one wan=\r\nts to find water.\n\n            One possibility is to do a homam and then me=\r\nditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to=\r\n.\n\n            I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from t=\r\nhe little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation o=\r\nf the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel t=\r\nhe layer of duality and realize Self.\n\n            Lalita means gentle one =\r\nand Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gentl=\r\ny, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you=\r\n will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid pat=\r\nhs.\n\n            Best regards,\n            Narasimha\n            ----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n            Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n            &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n            http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n            Films that make a difference: http:=\r\n//SaraswatiFil ms.org\n            Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom\n            Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/JyotishWri tings\n            ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -\n\n            --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal.=\r\n net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\n            From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net=\r\n &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n            Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam an=\r\nd Sri Vidya\n            To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n            Date=\r\n: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n\n            Dear Sri Narasimharao gar=\r\nu,\n\n            I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi hom=\r\nam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to =\r\ndo your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in s=\r\nuch a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (=\r\n20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abh=\r\nishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to a=\r\nbout 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals seve=\r\nral times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate =\r\nthese along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Cou=\r\nld you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt?

In the case of a=\r\n person who \n  chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming=\r\n Self&quot; and eats \n  tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from fail=\r\ning to absorb the mind \n  in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind =\r\ndwells on the nice (or even \n  not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food,=\r\n what is the big deal? On the \n  other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in=\r\n Self and dwells on the taste of \n  feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, =\r\nthe fact that failure results in a very \n  bad dual experience may act as a=\r\nn incentive in succeeding \nquickly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, di=\r\nfficult tasks cannot necessarily be \n  accomplished by everyone merely beca=\r\nuse of an incentive. Not everyone trying \n  Aghora sadhanas succeeds.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Take another simple example. Supp=\r\nose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, \n  like japam and homam, and yet hav=\r\ning a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is \n  dwelling on sex or getting=\r\n sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that \n  is causing guilt and =\r\nblocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;A regular person w=\r\nill try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from \n  sexual thoughts.=\r\n But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After \n  all, such=\r\n thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy \n  fo=\r\nr 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not=\r\n \n  return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination som=\r\ne minds \n  may have for sex?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;An aghora wil=\r\nl take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause \n  and remove fa=\r\nscination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as \n  two diffe=\r\nrent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them \n  int=\r\no one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits \n=\r\n  naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. =\r\nIn \n  the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think tha=\r\nt his \n  sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam=\r\n like that \n  for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogramme=\r\nd. He may no \n  longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no lo=\r\nnger feel \n  titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and=\r\n sex may be \n  broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally ma=\r\ny no longer evoke \n  thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any=\r\n small thoughts related \n  to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not le=\r\nad to denser and denser \n  thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadh=\r\nana, but they may now take the \n  mind back to meditation. After spending s=\r\no much time in meditation while \n  sitting naked intimately, the attraction=\r\n and thrill mind may feel for \n  nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. =\r\nOverall, the person&#39;s fascination \n  and weakness for sex may be gone large=\r\nly.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Mind has a lot of conditioning based o=\r\nn prior experiences and the \n  thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes=\r\n tries to break down some of these \n  structures by engaging in certain pra=\r\nctices that undermine those \n  structures.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible \n  t=\r\nhat the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks =\r\nof \n  sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditati=\r\non \n  everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;ready to \n  start with.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  *&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Bottom=\r\nline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses \n  head on and sets up=\r\n a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may \n  push the pro=\r\nblems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such \n  a risk=\r\ny strategy is not applicable to all.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Like Manish said in a mail earli=\r\ner, &quot;what is Vedanta and what \n  is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical w=\r\nay to understand and absorb Vedanta \n  in one&#39;s thought process, by setting=\r\n up a high stakes war plan. However, it is \n  certainly not suitable for al=\r\nl and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, \n  some people may feel att=\r\nraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the \n  thrill such an und=\r\nerstanding brings.&nbsp;Aghora stands for neither thrills \n  nor perversion=\r\n, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or \n  perversion=\r\n. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, \n  but Ag=\r\nhora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking \n  =\r\nby making failure very unpleasant.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;BTW, th=\r\ne following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths \n  and ex=\r\nplains the basic reality.

Anyway, your reply was a \n =\r\n         great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by lay=\r\ners \n          of duality! I never thought in those terms. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n         =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;I have started =\r\nreading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of \n          reading it flu=\r\nently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan \n          to do dur=\r\ning navaratri of 2010.

On the other hand, there are=\r\n some people who do not \n            know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours =\r\nto read Chandipath with great \n            difficulty in their first attemp=\r\nt. THEY are doing Chandi homam \n            everyday and it takes them 1.5 =\r\nhours now. THAT is \n            awe-inspiring.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Integrating various s=\r\nadhanas is a personal \n            problem that needs a personal solution. =\r\nIn general, it is a good \n            idea to pick one or two sadhanas and =\r\nmaximize the time spent on \n            them, instead of splitting the time=\r\n between ten things.

However, \n            from the little I=\r\n have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic \n            representation=\r\n of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its \n            purpose, too, =\r\nis to unravel the layer of duality and realize \n            Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;La=\r\nlita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce \n            one.

You also wrote \n            that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5=\r\n hours to do your chandi homam. \n            How can you accomplish that fe=\r\nat with 700 ahutis in such a short \n            time? Also, in my case, I d=\r\no sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 \n            minutes)+ganapathi mant=\r\nra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra \n            Abhishekam with =\r\npachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) \n            totalling to a=\r\nbout 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do \n            special=\r\n rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 \n            hours=\r\n in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri \n            vidyo=\r\npasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain \n            w=\r\nhat is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to \n      =\r\n      learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen \n   =\r\n         interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all=\r\n \n            the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar \n    =\r\n        recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nagraj \n      Kota&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOC=\r\nKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00A0_01CAB5FC.4365C6D0--\r\n\n"}}
