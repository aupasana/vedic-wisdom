If he does that, a=\r\nnd so long as he does that, he\nis a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he g=\r\noes about making money. You on\nthe other hand should give help only to the =\r\nreal Brahmin who deserves it;\nthat leads to heaven. But sometimes a gift to=\r\n another person who does not\ndeserve it leads to the other place, says our =\r\nscripture.\n\nYou must be on your guard about that. He only is the Brahmin wh=\r\no has no\nsecular employment. Secular employment is not for the Brahmin but =\r\nfor the\nother castes. To the Brahmins I appeal, that they must work hard to=\r\n raise\nthe Indian people by teaching them what they know, by giving out the=\r\n culture\nthat they have accumulated for centuries. It is clearly the duty o=\r\nf the\nBrahmins of India to remember what real Brahminhood is. As Manu says,=\r\n all\nthese privileges and honours are given to the Brahmin, because &quot;with h=\r\nim is\nthe treasury of virtue&quot;.\n\nBut it is one thing to gain an advantage, a=\r\nnd another thing to preserve it\nfor evil use. Whenever power is used for ev=\r\nil, it becomes diabolical; it\nmust be used for good only. So this accumulat=\r\ned culture of ages of which the\nBrahmin has been the trustee, he must now g=\r\nive to the people at large, and\nit was because he did not give it to the pe=\r\nople that the Mohammedan invasion\nwas possible.\n\nIt was because he did not =\r\nopen this treasury to the people from the\nbeginning, that for a thousand ye=\r\nars we have been trodden under the heels of\nevery one who chose to come to =\r\nIndia. It was through that we have become\ndegraded, and the first task must=\r\n be to break open the cells that hide the\nwonderful treasures which our com=\r\nmon ancestors accumulated; bring them out\nand give them to everybody and th=\r\ne Brahmin must be the first to do it. There\nis an old superstition in Benga=\r\nl that if the cobra that bites, sucks out his\nown poison from the patient, =\r\nthe man must survive. Well then, the Brahmin\nmust suck out his own poison.\n=\r\n\nTo the non-Brahmin castes I say, wait, be not in a hurry. Do not seize eve=\r\nry\nopportunity of fighting the Brahmin, because, as I have shown, you are\ns=\r\nuffering from your own fault.Who told you to neglect spirituality and\nSansk=\r\nrit learning? What have you been doing all this time? Why have you been\nind=\r\nifferent? Why do you now fret and fume because somebody else had more\nbrain=\r\ns, more energy, more pluck and go, than you?
