Now, he has left our city - so I turn to you =\r\nfor help. I know just the mantras for changing the sacred thread and I chan=\r\nt the savitru gayatri mantra for a thousand times. Last year, our priest ma=\r\nde the brahmachAris do a homam with the same mantra a thousand times but sa=\r\nid the householders should only do a japam, although at other times I do of=\r\nfer gayatri mantra in almost every homam that I do. Now, I need guidance fr=\r\nom you in some aspects, if you could help me. \n\n1. I have two sons, whose u=\r\npanayanam is done. I want them make them do a homam with thousand times Gay=\r\natri mantra while I want to chant the mantra with them. Can I also join in =\r\nthe homam? \n\n2. Can you guide us how to recite the mahasankalpa, kAnDa rish=\r\ni tarpaNas etc. (essentially the whole upAkarma procedure, if possible)\n\nAl=\r\nso, I was told that upakarma is done because vedas are not supposed to be s=\r\ntudied in uttarAyana (as this time is earmarked for studying shad-angas and=\r\n other sastras/itihasas), but vedic schools do study anyway because they mu=\r\nst finish the syllabus in time and hence as a prAyaschitta they do perform =\r\nthis upAkarma. But now a days, with no one studying vedas, (at least in our=\r\n family) is it still relevant to do this? In any case, I think it is a good=\r\n idea at least to change the sacred thread and chant the Gayatri mantra to =\r\nthe best of our ability on that day. Could you please advise us as to how t=\r\no carry out that project? \n\nAlso, I have one trivial question, what is &quot;dwi=\r\ntIya parArthE&quot; ? as it comes in dwitIya parArthE, swEtha varAha kalpE, vaiv=\r\naswata manvantarE .... and so on. I know the rest of them, but confused abo=\r\nut this phrase! \n\nRegards, \n\nNagraj Kota \n\n\n"}}
