Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my judgment, a rudraksha mala is =\r\nmore than \n&gt; &gt; enough for Ganesha sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For Lakshmi, kamala=\r\ngutta mala (a garland of lotus \n&gt; &gt; seeds) is considered the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best. I=\r\n did use one that was gifted by the same \n&gt; &gt; priest who gifted me so many =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other religious articles. However, in my judgment, \n&gt; &gt; I had more f=\r\nruitful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sessions of Mahalakshmi meditation with \n&gt; &gt; Rudraksha mala =\r\nthan with it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rudraksha and Tulasi are very special compared \n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n all other malas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of using a different mala for each d=\r\neity, it \n&gt; &gt; is a good idea to use a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; single mala for all meditation=\r\n and let it be a \n&gt; &gt; repository of all the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; generated energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me of an unrelated inc=\r\nident. When \n&gt; &gt; Shata Chandi homam conducted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Chennai in March 20=\r\n06 was finished, priests \n&gt; &gt; bathed the idols in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; garbhaalaya wi=\r\nth the water from the kalashas \n&gt; &gt; (pots) used in the homas and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bro=\r\nught malas from the idol and gave them to us. \n&gt; &gt; The priest put a Rudraks=\r\nha \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mala from the Mother around my neck. A passing \n&gt; &gt; thought came =\r\nto me and got \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck in my mind for a couple of seconds, &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; alre=\r\nady have so many rudraksha \n&gt; &gt; &gt; malas, but I have no sphatika mala, which=\r\n is \n&gt; &gt; considered ideal for the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother. I just took a vow of doing=\r\n Chandipath for \n&gt; &gt; 108 days. I wish he had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; given me a sphatika mal=\r\na instead of this \n&gt; &gt; rudraksha mala.&quot; Then I forgot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about that stu=\r\npid thought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This was in the afternoon. Next morning, we were =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in a flight from Chennai to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hyderabad. In another day, I was to=\r\n leave for \n&gt; &gt; Boston. In the flight to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hyderabad, my son was kickin=\r\ng the seat in front of \n&gt; &gt; him and the gentleman \n&gt; &gt; &gt; turned back to com=\r\nplain. I apologized and told my \n&gt; &gt; son to behave. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gentleman tu=\r\nrned forward and again turned back \n&gt; &gt; in a few seconds and asked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nyou are PVR Narasimha Rao, right?&quot; I said yes. \n&gt; &gt; He apparently uses my f=\r\nree \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish software and likes me. Though I had \n&gt; &gt; offered all my =\r\nhair to Balaji at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thirumala a few days back and was without any \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n hair, he still identified me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on a photo published 6 years bac=\r\nk in an \n&gt; &gt; interview in a Jyotish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; magazine! He talked to me for a =\r\nwhile.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When we reached Hyderabad, he ran to the \n&gt; &gt; baggage c=\r\nlaim, collected his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suitcase, took out a sphatika mala from it and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; gifted it to me. He said he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; met a saint on the previous afternoo=\r\nn at Chennai \n&gt; &gt; and the saint gave him \n&gt; &gt; &gt; three sphatika malas - one =\r\nfor him, one for a \n&gt; &gt; family member and the third \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one meant for so=\r\nmeone else. The saint told him \n&gt; &gt; that he would meet somebody \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he r=\r\nespected on the next day and he was \n&gt; &gt; supposed to hand over the mala to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that person. When he saw me, he decided that the \n&gt; &gt; mala was meant=\r\n for me. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, his meeting with the saint happened \n&gt; &gt; aro=\r\nund the same time I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had that stupid thought about sphatika mala in t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; garbhalaya of the temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; During shata Chandi homam, I=\r\n took a vow to read \n&gt; &gt; Chandipath for 108 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; consecutive days. I did =\r\nit and used that mala to \n&gt; &gt; count the moola mantra. At \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the end, th=\r\nat priest came to Boston and conducted \n&gt; &gt; 10 Chandi homas at our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nouse to complete the sadhana. During the last \n&gt; &gt; homam, a strong thought =\r\ncame \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to my mind, &quot;the purpose for which that sphatika \n&gt; &gt; mala was =\r\nsent is over. Now \n&gt; &gt; &gt; offer it back to the Mother in fire.&quot; I suppressed=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; my instincts and did not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do it. I wanted to hang on to it. See=\r\n, I formed an \n&gt; &gt; attachment with it! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, that mala brok=\r\ne on the same \n&gt; &gt; evening, a little after that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam was finished! =\r\nOf course, I made a mala \n&gt; &gt; again with the sphatikas and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kept it f=\r\nor offering it in fire next time. Now I \n&gt; &gt; realized that my attachment \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; was foolish.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I did Chandipath and Chandi homam=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; many more times after that, but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that was the first 108 and I w=\r\nas destined to use \n&gt; &gt; the mala given by that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; saint for that round.=\r\n Now, of course, I use the \n&gt; &gt; same rudraksha mala for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything a=\r\nnd did not look for another sphatika \n&gt; &gt; mala.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is the nature of mind to see variety. There are \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndifferent types of malas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and different kinds of rituals and mind is =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fascinated by the variety. At the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; end, mind needs to be trained=\r\n to see the same in \n&gt; &gt; the variety. But, in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning, mind do=\r\nes see variety and it needs to \n&gt; &gt; wade through variety...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; &gt; -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: \n&gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-\n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): \n&gt; &gt; http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): \n&gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \n&gt; &gt; ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, February 06, 2009 3:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Mala For Ganesha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n. I would like to ask you yet another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whi=\r\nch mala is best for Ganesha Japa? I know \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say to stick with=\r\n one mala for all Japa however \n&gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind cannot fully accept thi=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which mala is best for Ganesha? Sandalwood,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Turm=\r\neric or Sphatik? Or something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else entirely? Thank you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Sir...........\n&gt; \n&gt; I too have the same=\r\n type of confusion as you regarding malas, etc\n&gt; and as I have some familia=\r\nrity with jyotish I have extendend my \n&gt; madness to picking the absolutely =\r\nperfect muhurta for performing my \n&gt; irregularly scheduled homa.  You see I=\r\n want spiritual growth and I \n&gt; want to &#39;get something&#39; out of it as well, =\r\nand subsequently the homas \n&gt; where I was very attached to getting somethin=\r\ng were tinged with my \n&gt; desire and the quality of my concentration suffere=\r\nd. The same with \n&gt; the malas, I think that some &#39;thing&#39; is going to ensure=\r\n my success in \n&gt; a sadhana when actually my willingness to drop the attach=\r\nment and the \n&gt; confusion that always seems to attend my selfish desires, a=\r\nnd focus \n&gt; on the sadhana itself is the key.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know you had asked Nar=\r\nasimha, but I felt a certain kinship with \n&gt; your dilema.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards=\r\n............Ajaya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
