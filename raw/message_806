Hope th=\r\ne \ntopic is not inappropriate.\n\n I was wondering if someone could tell me o=\r\nr point me to articles \nwhich explain to some depth what a Bijakshara is, w=\r\nhat are the \nBijaksharas and why they are said to be powerful. \n\n Specifica=\r\nlly, I also want to know - why do only some \nsounds/syllables qualify as Bi=\r\njaksharas? Also, what exactly is the \ndifference between a mantra and bijak=\r\nsharas? Are all bijaksharas \nautomatically mantras? Do mantras consist only=\r\n of bijaksharas? What \neffects do bijaksharas have that mantras dont have a=\r\nnd vice versa?\n\n As you can see, I want a detailed explanation.. Any and al=\r\nl details \nwill be highly appreciated..\n\nThanks,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n"}}
