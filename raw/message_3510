How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the exper=\r\nience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personalit=\r\ny is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadh=\r\nak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no=\r\n difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to ha=\r\nppen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be b=\r\nad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; devatas make the person =\r\ncare almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised an=\r\nd the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=\r\n=82 very little=C3=82 according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a=\r\n use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Pra=\r\nchand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be th=\r\nat of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of the b=\r\nody, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originall=\r\ny a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment(\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nShakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; bl=\r\nack magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; =\r\na normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebo=\r\ndy who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, t=\r\nhen the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the =\r\nsadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people =\r\npersist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then th=\r\nere is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then thei=\r\nr minds and intellects will not be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; the body=\r\n and so their actions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black mag=\r\nic. These people usually join the same spirits which they have\n&gt; &gt; been usi=\r\nng after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebod=\r\ny is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this birth =\r\nhe or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a =\r\nfew repitions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the o=\r\nther hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel tha=\r\nt the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; acheive=\r\n in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the e=\r\nating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, th=\r\nen starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=\r\n=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every =\r\nday, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same mat=\r\nerials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on=\r\n rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(f=\r\nrom the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow=\r\n a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are =\r\nempty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whol=\r\ne procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and =\r\nafter.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so=\r\n do some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physi=\r\ncally\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which we=\r\nre being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You=\r\n may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; that =\r\nthis is suitable.\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

Here there is only action and re=\r\naction.(Bit like you attack&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get =\r\na result of this from that same Atma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 t=\r\no 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identi=\r\nfying with the universe and has very few karmas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the=\r\n Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on th=\r\ne sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=\r\n=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of ide=\r\nntification with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which=\r\n are generally termed as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually joi=\r\nn the same spirits\n which they have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; been using after death, th=\r\nis is not an enjoyable experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is wors=\r\nhipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth =\r\nhe or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive=\r\n after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; eff=\r\nort).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in thi=\r\ns lifetime may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra=\r\n are crucial and may not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then =\r\nstarting on some good day, do 1000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(s=\r\nome=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is=\r\n hidden) every day, main constraints&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Same\n place.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same materials.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direct=\r\nion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudr=\r\naksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on s=\r\nex(from the mind and the body, not just the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food=\r\n intake, grow a beard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make=\r\n sure your bowels are empty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; before you start.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Con=\r\ntinue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; S=\r\nee the difference in your personality before and after.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Long a=\r\nnd short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; possible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concept=\r\ns which were being discussed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love an=\r\nd Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; manish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as=\r\n a\n clarification from me if you feel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZ=\r\nE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
