But I=\r\n admit it would be very challenging to do an extra half hour japa every day=\r\n this month, in addition to my current 45 min sit down japa practice- mainl=\r\ny because of my continuously changing working hours, and lack of consistent=\r\n routine from week to week.  \n\nHowever I will join you in your Mahamrityunj=\r\naya worship to the best of my ability. For the past few weeks, I have been =\r\nthinking about doing a Mahamrityunjaya havan every week for my patients. Yo=\r\nur decision to do japa of this mantra has inspired me to take some action o=\r\nn this. For the next 4 weeks, while you are doing your japa, I will do Maha=\r\nmrityunjaya havan every weekend- for the wellbeing of my patients and all b=\r\neings in general. \n\nIn fact, I will make a start with this project this wee=\r\nkend- tomorrow will be the first havan. This is a happy weekend for me in g=\r\neneral, because I will complete 250,000 repetitions of Om Namo Narayanaya t=\r\noday- I will be doing a Vishnu havan after this today to celebrate. \n\nThank=\r\ns for the inspiration LakshmiNarayanji. :) Please keep us updated on your p=\r\nlans with the Mahamrityunjaya japa....hope it goes well.\n\nTake care,\n\nAparn=\r\na \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Aparnaji,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n My deep thanks for sending this lovingkind healing energy.

I know you are doing the purscharan of another ma=\r\nntra and have a =A0demanding life as a Dr. I also want to do first time onl=\r\ny 11 thousands japa and not go for complete 1.25lacs. Last year I started t=\r\nhis one but due to lot of tension and other things gave up. I know many peo=\r\nple can do lac japa in 40 days or early.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to do 501 every day. I=\r\nt takes me 30/35 minutes. So it will take, say about 25/26 days. I do not d=\r\no haven but as you are doing it it will be amazing for you to do, at the en=\r\nd of it, if you have never done it on your own. So in a relaxing way it wil=\r\nl be a month.\n&gt; This is all my personal estimates. I do not use a Mala. I u=\r\nse a clock. At the start I center myself and drink some water. I then say p=\r\nrayers to align myself with the Divine Beings whose Mantra and Swroop =A0I =\r\nam going to meditate upon. At the end I again drink water. You might do thi=\r\nngs in a different way.\n&gt; \n&gt; See if have time in your demanding everyday sc=\r\nhedule=A0for this as well.\n&gt; Take care and thanks again,\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 18 July 2012, 18=\r\n:32\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: [JyotishGroup] Temple at Nathdwara....\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Hello LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to hear you are having health prob=\r\nlems and suffering pain.
