Suddenly one of the visitors started weepi=\r\nng bitterly.\n\n&#39;I am a horrible sinner. For a long time I have been coming t=\r\no you, but there is no change in me. Can I become pure at last? How long am=\r\n I to wait? When I am here near you, I am good for a time. But when I leave=\r\n this place, I become a beast again. You cannot imagine how bad I can be --=\r\n hardly a human being. Am I to remain a sinner forever?&#39;\n\n&#39;Why do you come =\r\nto me? What have I to do with you?&#39; demanded Bhagavan. &#39;What is there betwe=\r\nen us that you should come here and weep and cry in front of me?&#39;\n\nThe man =\r\nstarted moaning and crying even more, as if his heart were breaking.\n\n&#39;All =\r\nmy hopes of salvation are gone. You were my last refuge and you say you hav=\r\ne nothing to do with me! To whom shall I turn now? What am I to do? To whom=\r\n am I to go?&#39;\n\nBhagavan watched him for some time and\n said, &#39;Am I your Gur=\r\nu that I should be responsible for your salvation? Have I ever said that I =\r\nam your Master?&#39;\n\n&#39;If you are not my Master, then who is? And who are you, =\r\nif not my Master? You are my Guru. You are my guardian angel. You must take=\r\n pity me and release me from my sins!&#39;\n\nHe started sobbing and crying again=\r\n.\n\nWe all sat silent, overcome with pity. Only Bhagavan looked alert and ma=\r\ntter-of-fact.\n\n&#39;If I am your Guru, what are my fees? Surely you should pay =\r\nme for my services.&#39;\n\n&#39;But you won&#39;t take anything,&#39; cried the visitor. &#39;Wh=\r\nat can I give you?&#39;\n\n&#39;Did I ever say that I don&#39;t take anything? And did yo=\r\nu ever ask me what you can give me?&#39;\n\n&#39;If you would take, then ask me. Ther=\r\ne is nothing I would not give you.&#39;\n\n&#39;All right. Now I am asking. Give me. =\r\nWhat will you give me?&#39;\n\n&#39;Take anything. Everything I have is yours.&#39;\n\n&#39;The=\r\nn give me all the good you have done in this\n world.&#39;\n\n&#39;What good could I h=\r\nave done? I have not a single virtue to my credit.&#39;\n\n&#39;You have promised to =\r\ngive. Now give. Don&#39;t talk of your credit. Just give away all the good you =\r\nhave done in your past.&#39;\n\n&#39;Yes, I shall give. But how does one give? Tell m=\r\ne how the giving is done and I shall give.&#39;\n\n&#39;Say like this: &quot;All the good =\r\nI have done in the past I am giving away entirely to my Guru. Henceforth I =\r\nhave no merit from it nor have I any concern with it.&quot; Say it with your who=\r\nle heart.&#39;\n\n&#39;All right, Swami. &quot;I am giving away to you all the good I have=\r\n done so far, if I have done any, and all its good effects. I am giving it =\r\nto you gladly, for you are my Master and you are asking me to give it all a=\r\nway to you.&#39;\n\n&#39;But this is not enough,&#39; said Bhagavan sternly.\n\n&#39;I gave you=\r\n all I have and all you asked me to give. I have nothing more to give.&#39;\n\n&#39;N=\r\no, you have. Give me all your sins.&#39;\n\nThe man looked wildly\n at Bhagavan, t=\r\nerror stricken.=C2=A0\n\n&#39;You do not know, Swami, what you are asking for. If=\r\n you knew, you would not ask me. If you take over my sins, your body will r=\r\not and burn. You do not know me, you do not know my sins. Please do not ask=\r\n me for my sins.&#39;=C2=A0\n\nHe wept bitterly.\n\n&#39;I shall look after myself. Don=\r\n&#39;t you worry about me,&#39; said Bhagavan. &#39;All I want from you is your sins.&#39;\n=\r\n\nFor a long time the bargain would not go through. The man refused to part =\r\nwith his sins. But Bhagavan was adamant.\n\n&#39;Either give me your sins along w=\r\nith your merits, or keep both and don&#39;t think of me as your Master.&quot;\n\nIn th=\r\ne end the visitor&#39;s scruples broke down and he declared, &#39;Whatever sins I h=\r\nave done, they are no longer mine. All of them and their results, too, belo=\r\nng to Ramana.&#39;\n\nBhagavan seemed to be satisfied. &#39;From now on there is no g=\r\nood nor bad in you. You are just pure. Go and do nothing, either good or ba=\r\nd. Remain\n yourself. Remain what you are.&#39;\n\nA great peace fell over the man=\r\n and over us all. No one knows what happened to the fortunate visitor, for =\r\nhe was never seen in the ashram again. He might have had no further need to=\r\n come.\n\nSource: From the Krishna Bhikshu chapter in The Power of the Presen=\r\nce, Part Three, by David Godman\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 \n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 \n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

Tell me how the giving is done and I shall give=\r\n.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;Say like this: &quot;All the good I have done in the past I am giving=\r\n away entirely to my Guru. Henceforth I have no merit from it nor have I an=\r\ny concern with it.&quot; Say it with your whole heart.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;All right, Swami=\r\n. &quot;I am giving away to you all the good I have done so far, if I have done =\r\nany, and all its good effects. I am giving it to you gladly, for you are my=\r\n Master and you are asking me to give it all away to you.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;But this=\r\n is not enough,&#39; said Bhagavan sternly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;I gave you all I have and a=\r\nll you asked me to give. I have nothing more to give.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;No, you have=\r\n. Give me all your sins.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man looked wildly\n at Bhagavan, terror=\r\n stricken.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;You do not know, Swami, what you are asking for. I=\r\nf you knew, you would not ask me. If you take over my sins, your body will =\r\nrot and burn. You do not know me, you do not know my sins. Please do not as=\r\nk me for my sins.&#39;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wept bitterly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;I shall look afte=\r\nr myself. Don&#39;t you worry about me,&#39; said Bhagavan. &#39;All I want from you is=\r\n your sins.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a long time the bargain would not go through. The m=\r\nan refused to part with his sins. But Bhagavan was adamant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;Either =\r\ngive me your sins along with your merits, or keep both and don&#39;t think of m=\r\ne as your Master.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end the visitor&#39;s scruples broke down and =\r\nhe declared, &#39;Whatever sins I have done, they are no longer mine. All of th=\r\nem and their results, too, belong to Ramana.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan seemed to be =\r\nsatisfied. &#39;From now on there is no good nor bad in you. You are just pure.=\r\n Go and do nothing, either good or bad. Remain\n yourself. Remain what you a=\r\nre.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A great peace fell over the man and over us all. No one knows w=\r\nhat happened to the fortunate visitor, for he was never seen in the ashram =\r\nagain. He might have had no further need to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: From the Krishna Bhikshu chapter in The Pow=\r\ner of the Presence, Part Three, by David Godman\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size: 87%; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82 &nbsp;=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B &nbsp;=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 &nbsp;=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 &nbs=\r\np;=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D &nbsp;=E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;=\r\n1&quot;&gt; \nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
