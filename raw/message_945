Somehow, I \nhad to be away from an active a=\r\nstrologer&#39;s role over last couple of \nyears or so due to the karmic bondage=\r\ns and now with god&#39;s grace am \npart of this esteemed group of your honoured=\r\n selves.\n\nMyself is a strong believer of the mantra shakti that energises t=\r\nhe \ncosmic environment around ourselves and also strengthens the \nparticula=\r\nr part of the body or the overall spiritual evolution of \nthe individual or=\r\n the group and cleanses their karma.\n\nTo my understanding, the mantras in S=\r\nanskrit are written in such a \nway that each syllable of a particular mantr=\r\na and the complete \nmantra thereof energises the visible and non-visible at=\r\noms in our \nbody or the environment around us for us to evolve spiritually.=\r\n  \nTantra is the personification of the mantra in the doable form while \nya=\r\nntra is the mechanical form of the same.  May be, there are other \nscholars=\r\n to comment on the above lines.\n\nLook forward to interact with your kind se=\r\nlves.\n\nWith kind regards,\nPrakash Kandpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, e-gurukul &lt;venkat.koppaka@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Source : www.awgp.org www.a=\r\nwgpsouth.org\n&gt; Author : Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear ALL,\n&gt; \n&gt; *Mat=\r\nter and Consciousness: Unification of Physics and Vedic \nTheories** *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n* *\n&gt; \n&gt; The study of consciousness and life is often regarded as a field \n=\r\npertaining\n&gt; to philosophy, psychology and the so-called metaphysical scien=\r\nces. \nHowever,\n&gt; as we shall see here, the hardcore physical sciences deali=\r\nng with \nthe\n&gt; studies of matter also seem to share something common in thi=\r\ns \nensemble of\n&gt; vertical convergence of knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; About seven decade=\r\ns ago the great scientist Albert Einstein had \npresented\n&gt; the hypothesis o=\r\nf grand unification of cosmic forces. This \nreflects his\n&gt; visualization of=\r\n the subtle existence of higher and deeper \ndimensions of\n&gt; existence that =\r\nwere realized by the Vedic Rishis. This article \npresents an\n&gt; extract of s=\r\nome of the comparable aspects of both the modern and \nthe vedic\n&gt; scientifi=\r\nc insights.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ever since the research in particle physics has been focus=\r\ned on \nthe subtler\n&gt; forms of matter (from atom to quark, and gradually to =\r\nanti-\nmatter=85) and the\n&gt; decipheration of the complexities of the biomole=\r\ncules, it is \nbecoming more\n&gt; and more evident that the living system exist=\r\ns in an unimaginably \nsubliminal\n&gt; form that could ultimately be perceived,=\r\n in the gross world, only \nas an\n&gt; energy-packet of consciousness. Albert E=\r\ninstein, through his \nconcept of\n&gt; &#39;Pure Thought&#39;, was able to see the perf=\r\nect order that exists in \nthe\n&gt; universe. He therefore accepted the inabili=\r\nty of contemporary \nresearch in\n&gt; particle physics and other areas of moder=\r\nn sciences in \ncomprehending even a\n&gt; fraction of the orderly creation of t=\r\nhe great, unknown, absolute \nSpirit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Adi Shankaracharya has mentioned =\r\nabout the subtle aspects of the \nphysical\n&gt; world in his magnum opus &quot;Vivek=\r\n Chudamani&quot; as =96=96\n&gt; \n&gt; *Aikyam Tayorlakshitayoh, Na Vacyaya | Nigadyate=\r\nnyonya Viruddha \nDharminoh |\n&gt; Khadyota Bhanyoriv Rajbh=97atyayauh | Kupamb=\r\nurashyoh Parmanumevoh ||\n&gt; \n&gt; Meaning:* The divine source of the (existence=\r\n of the) cosmos and \nevery\n&gt; creature or particle in the universe are subli=\r\nminally linked \ntogether and\n&gt; are similar in the sense of the similarity b=\r\netween &#39;the sun and a \nglowworm&#39;,\n&gt; &#39;an ocean and a well&#39;, &#39;a king and a la=\r\nborer&#39;, or &#39;a mountain and \nan atom&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Research into the atomic and sub=\r\ntler structures of matter has \npaved the way\n&gt; towards searching the common=\r\nality between matter and energy. May \nbe, one day\n&gt; the research will be mo=\r\ntivated towards deciphering the commonality \nbetween\n&gt; energy and conscious=\r\nness. About seven decades ago, Einstein had \ndefined the\n&gt; space as the gra=\r\nnd unification of gravitational and \nelectromagnetic forces.\n&gt; Later on, tw=\r\no more forces, namely, the &#39;Weak Force&#39; and \nthe &#39;Strong Force&#39;\n&gt; were also=\r\n considered in the definition of Space as a &#39;Unified \nField&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Einstein=\r\n&#39;s investigations into the &#39;Four Dimensional Curved \nSpace&#39; =96=96 Time,\n&gt; =\r\nhave given pioneering directions to future scientists for deeper \nelucidati=\r\non\n&gt; of various aspects of universal subtle forces and their grand \nsource =\r\nin the\n&gt; eternal Consciouness Force. In this respect Einstein deserves a \np=\r\nlace in\n&gt; modern sciences equivalent to the revered positions of the sages =\r\n\nlike\n&gt; Vishwamitra, Patanjali and Vyas in the spiritual science of vital \n=\r\nenergy\n&gt; and Consciouness force as described in the vedic treatises.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe discovery of anti-matter in physics has given interesting \nclues for\n&gt; s=\r\ntudying the concepts of &#39;Anti-World&#39; and &#39;Meta-Space&#39; mentioned \nin the\n&gt; V=\r\nedas and Upanishads. Noted thinker Robert Ernest Humes has \nmentioned in\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;The Thirteen Principal Upanishads&quot; that the main objective of the\n&gt; Upanis=\r\nhads is =96=96 the search for absolute truth, ultimate \nknowledge, and its\n=\r\n&gt; enlightened use for the welfare and progress of all creatures. \nRenowned\n=\r\n&gt; scholar Maxmueller in his &quot;Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy&quot; has \nexpre=\r\nssed\n&gt; similar views. According to them, the insights of the Vedas and \nUpa=\r\nnishads\n&gt; have inspired and guided the pioneers and independent researchers=\r\n \nof &#39;matter\n&gt; and life&#39; in all ages. The ancient scriptures will continue =\r\nto \nfurther\n&gt; enlighten the scientific investigations of the modern times a=\r\ns \nwell, if\n&gt; studied attentively in the right perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Ishopa=\r\nnishad begins with the phrase =96 &quot;Purnamadah Purnamidam&quot;, \nwhich\n&gt; implies=\r\n that the Supreme Cosmic Power =96 Brahm  (the Omnipresent\n&gt; Consciouness F=\r\norce)\n&gt; is one and absolutely complete. There are many &#39;formulae&#39; given in =\r\n\nthe\n&gt; Upanishads, which explain the sublime principles of the physical\n&gt; m=\r\nanifestation of Nature and existence of matter (referred \nas &#39;This&#39; in the\n=\r\n&gt; corresponding vedic hymns) and its eternal relation with the unique\n&gt; uni=\r\nversal force, the infinite &#39;whole&#39; (referred as &#39;That&#39;). The \nuncertainty\n&gt;=\r\n principles of the Quantum Mechanical approach, the postulations of \npartic=\r\nle\n&gt; physics, the &#39;Pure Thought&#39; of Einstein and later findings of \ntheoret=\r\nical\n&gt; and experimental physicists (including Dr. Yogesh Pati, Dr. Abdus \nS=\r\nalam, Dr.\n&gt; Howard George and Dr. Sheldon Glashaw) on quark, leptons, anti-=\r\n\nmatter and\n&gt; the grand unification of forces, can all be seen implied in t=\r\nhe \nmantras of\n&gt; the Upanishads.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prof. N. Hugen used to be a great cri=\r\ntic of the Indian Mythology. \nHowever,\n&gt; after investigating more into the =\r\nconcepts of &#39;Super Gravity&#39; \nand &quot;Anti\n&gt; Gravity&#39;, he had also accepted tha=\r\nt these together with the \nhypothesis of\n&gt; the Black Holes could be better =\r\nunderstood in light of the \ninsights of Vedic\n&gt; Philosophy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Researcher=\r\ns desirous of revealing the secrets of matter and life, \nmay view\n&gt; the ved=\r\nic knowledge as a science that deals with the subtler \nrealms and\n&gt; layers =\r\nof what has been discovered by the modern sciences so far. \nSir James\n&gt; Jea=\r\nns has noted that everything in this world happens in a logical \nand\n&gt; reas=\r\nonable manner like a mathematical principle. In his views, the \ncreator\n&gt; a=\r\nnd controller of this limitless absolute system could be none \nother than\n&gt;=\r\n the Unique, Infinite, and Supernatural Power, named as God.\n&gt; \n&gt; Modern sc=\r\nientists may attempt deciphering the mysterious universe \nmore\n&gt; deeply by =\r\nconsidering the existence of the subliminal forms of \nsubatomic\n&gt; particles=\r\n and perceivable energies in the infinite currents of the \nultimate\n&gt; &#39;ener=\r\ngy&#39; of the Omnipresent Consciouness  Force, which, so far, \nhas been\n&gt; left=\r\n for metaphysical research in philosophy. An open minded \nintegrated\n&gt; rese=\r\narch in focussed areas of physical, biological and cognitive \nsciences\n&gt; an=\r\nd spirituality would prove to be very fruitful towards unfolding \nof the\n&gt; =\r\nhidden linkages of matter and life and the super-unifying \nprinciple of\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nSarva Khalvidam Brahm&quot;- All this is Brahm.**\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
