However, we are discussing tarpana\n&gt;&gt; (literally &quot;to pleas=\r\ne&quot;). In the presence of a living father, a better\n&gt;&gt; analogy is that of &quot;go=\r\ning to visit a grandfather who lives elsewhere&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly, the father s=\r\nhould visit the grandfather. Does this mean that the\n&gt;&gt; grandson should not=\r\n visit the grandfather? And, when it comes to pleasing\n&gt;&gt; the grandfather, =\r\nis there a monopoly? Most grandparents get a special kind\n&gt;&gt; of a pleasure =\r\nfrom their grandkids.

Similarly with other beings like yakshas, gandharvas etc.=\r\n But, the point of tarpana is exactly the opposite. Rather than identifying=\r\n with the pitRs, we are trying to detach ourselves from them and their infl=\r\nuences. This will do nothing but help us to cultivate true bhakti and reach=\r\n our final goal sooner.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is important to under=\r\nstand the intent of the ritual and perform it accordingly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasneham,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1809018647gmail_quo=\r\nte&quot;&gt;On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 7:59 AM, Rama V &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vsra_prasad@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vsra_prasad@...&quot;&gt;vsra_prasad@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;yiv1809018647gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: =\r\n1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);&quot;&gt;\n\nNamaste.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAgain every example is t=\r\naken by the followers as they wish to :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLet me read / twist your=\r\n example - &quot;my grand father likes sweets, so I will not give tarpanam using=\r\n sesame seeds + water&quot;.

When the ancestors are alive, any one can meet him=\r\n; even his uncles, friends, neighbours, etc. If by the same logic, any one =\r\ncan do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues, just that I am not yet convinc=\r\ned :-)&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nLike I mentioned, to each his / her own.

In the prese=\r\nnce of a living father, a better&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; analogy is that of &quot;going to visi=\r\nt a grandfather who lives elsewhere&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Certainly, the father should=\r\n visit the grandfather. Does this mean that the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; grandson should no=\r\nt visit the grandfather? And, when it comes to pleasing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the grandf=\r\nather, is there a monopoly?
