Reading it again=\r\n\nafter all these years we realize what a fortunate soul he was, and also ho=\r\nw\nfortunate we all were to have moved closely with him for more than 35 yea=\r\nrs.\n\nI WAS BORN into a very orthodox Brahmin family on November 26, 1913, i=\r\nn the\nvillage of Mondakurathur, near Polur, North Arcot District. That was =\r\nalso\nthe birthplace of the Maharshi&#39;s renowned devotee, Echammal, who was r=\r\nelated\nto me on my mother&#39;s side of the family. My father, Brahmasri Krishn=\r\na\nGanapati, was a great Vedic scholar who taught Krishna Yajur Veda for thi=\r\nrty\nyears in the local Vedapatasala.\n\nI had my first darshan of Bhagavan Ma=\r\nharshi at Skandashram in 1921 when I\nwas eight years old. Sri Vasudeva Sast=\r\nry, one of the earliest devotees of\nBhagavan, took me to see him. Vasudeva =\r\nSastry was at that time teaching me\nSanskrit in the Patasala of the Arunach=\r\naleshwara Temple.\n\nLater in 1923, when Bhagavan came down to the present as=\r\nhram, I used to\nvisit the ashram often and sit in front of the Maharshi. At=\r\n that time I was\nstudying in the Municipal High School where Sri T.K.Sundar=\r\nesa Iyer was a\nteacher. After completing high school in 1930, I waited two =\r\nyears before\njoining an engineering college in Madras. During those two int=\r\nervening years\nI was at the ashram almost daily, along with T.K.S. I used t=\r\no spend time\nthere even at odd hours of the day or night.\n\nIn 1936, after e=\r\narning a diploma in civil engineering in Madras, I worked\nfor six months un=\r\nder Sri K.K.Nambiar. K.K.Nambiar, already a staunch devotee\nof Bhagavan, ha=\r\nd at that time the good fortune of being posted as the\nDistrict Board Engin=\r\neer right in Tiruvannamalai itself. By Bhagavan&#39;s grace,\nI was almost const=\r\nantly at the ashram between 1935 and 1945, though I was\nemployed off and on=\r\n in various places. I often quit jobs to come to Sri\nRamanasramam and be ne=\r\nar Sri Maharshi. My attachment to Bhagavan was such\nthat I could not remain=\r\n employed continuously until, by Bhagavan&#39;s grace,\nSri K.K.Nambiar, who was=\r\n then the Chief Engineer of the Madras Corporation\nin 1945, got me employed=\r\n by that Corporation. That ended the rolling-stone\nphase of my life, as I r=\r\netained this job until my retirement in January of\n1969. Throughout all the=\r\nse years I would never miss an opportunity to come\nto Bhagavan&#39;s ashram.\n\nO=\r\nn the occasion of my wedding on July 5, 1942, T. N. Venkataraman, now the\n[=\r\nlate] President of Sri Ramanasramam, came straight to Vellore from\nKaraikud=\r\ni to attend the ceremony. The train passed through and stopped at\nthe Tiruv=\r\nannamalai station, but T.N.V., along with his eight-year-old son,\nstayed on=\r\n the train and came straight to my marriage. When T.N.V.&#39;s father,\nChinnasw=\r\nami, heard about it he began to scold his son and criticised him for\ngoing =\r\nto Vellore to attend the wedding. Bhagavan overheard this from the Old\nHall=\r\n and said, &quot;Why is he shouting? Ambi (T.N.V.) has gone to attend his\nfriend=\r\n&#39;s marriage. There is nothing wrong in this.&quot;\n\nAfter I got married I came t=\r\no the ashram with my new wife and did pranams to\nBhagavan in the Old Hall. =\r\nMy wife, Jnanambal, was already deeply devoted to\nBhagavan and had had his =\r\ndarshan even as a girl of eight.\n\nThat day, after leaving the Old Hall, my =\r\nwife and I went and visitedMajor\nChadwick in his cottage. I had known Chadw=\r\nick since his arrival in the\nashram in 1935. He congratulated us on our mar=\r\nriage and remarked about the\nappropriateness of the bride&#39;s name, saying, &quot;=\r\nJnana you wanted and Jnana you\nhave gained.&quot;\n\nIn the earlier days some peop=\r\nle used to sleep in the Old Hall. Once I slept\nthere near the southern door=\r\n at the west side of the hall. I did not get up\neven after 5 a.m. Bhagavan =\r\ncame near me and touched me with his right toe\nsaying, &quot;Get up. Day has alr=\r\neady broken.&quot; I immediately got up and had the\ndarshan of Bhagavan. This is=\r\n called Visvarupa darshanam, the first darshan\nof the chosen deity in the m=\r\norning.\n\nThere was Veda Parayana every evening at the hall in the presence =\r\nof\nBhagavan. He would be mostly indrawn at that time. Following the Veda\nPa=\r\nrayana, from 7 to 7:30 p.m., recitations of the Maharshi&#39;s works in Tamil,\n=\r\nTelugu, Sanskrit, and Malayalam would take place. Devotees like Ramaswami\nP=\r\nillai, Kunjuswami, T.K.Sudaresa Iyer and some others used to take part in\ni=\r\nt. In the earlier days I was also participating. During Tamil Parayanam I\nn=\r\noticed Bhagavan appeared quite unconcerned with things around him, though\nh=\r\ne remained fully attentive to the recitation. He wouldn=E2=80=99t hesitate =\r\nto\ncorrect our pronunciation of the verses, as he was particular to obey al=\r\nl\nthe rules of prosody. Once I recited incorrectly the last verse in\n&quot;Aruna=\r\nchala Pancharatnam&quot; and Bhagavan pointed it out to me, demonstrating\nhow it=\r\n should be pronounced. He was satisfied only when I repeated it to him\ncorr=\r\nectly.\n\nAnother time I was sitting before Bhagavan and Vaidyanathan Stapati=\r\n was\nshowing Bhagavan the sculpture he was making of him. The Stapati asked=\r\n\nBhagavan for his opinion as to whether it was a good likeness of him.\nBhag=\r\navan said, &quot;I can&#39;t say. Only Natesan knows.&quot;\n\nVaidyanathan Stapati looked =\r\nat me and Bhagavan said, &quot;Not that Natesan, the\nbarber Natesan.&quot; He conside=\r\nred the barber to be the best authority on\nartistic representations of his =\r\nbody.\n\nAfter retirement from service I have come back to the ashram to serv=\r\ne the\ndevotees. The ashram President, Sri T.N.Venkataraman, being a close f=\r\nriend\nof mine since 1934, found me very useful to the new devotees since I =\r\ncould\nfunction as both a receptionist and an instructor. The president had\n=\r\nentrusted me with the accounts of the Mountain Path magazine, etc. I served=\r\n\nin the office until 1987. I ceased to work in the office due to glaucoma a=\r\nnd\ncataract. Again, by the grace of Sri Bhagavan, I was completely cured of=\r\n my\neye trouble and normal sight has been restored. Since I am getting aged=\r\n, the\nashram president was kind enough to accommodate me as an old resident=\r\n\ndevotee in the ashram.\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2009=\r\n/?pg=3Dmay-jun#article.1\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd51774dff1e9048aef5db1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIn 1993, he gave us the following article about his life.
