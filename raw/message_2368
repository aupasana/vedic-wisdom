That is more appropriate for the times we live in.\n=A0\nPeople =\r\nof old times had brightly burning bhootaagni inside. Their performance of a=\r\n daily fire ritual was just a responsibility towards the universe. They wer=\r\ne doing fire ritual for maintaining dharma in the universe and not necessar=\r\nily for saving their own bhootaagni from being extinguished.\n=A0\nMost peopl=\r\ne today - even those who are re-incarnations of very good yogis=A0from the =\r\nlast life - are initially lacking in internal purity and their bhootaagni i=\r\ns very very very weak and actually pretty much extinguished in most people.=\r\n The times are such, the culture is such, our lifestyles are such, the infl=\r\nuences on our minds are such and the energy filling the air we breath is su=\r\nch. Thus, one&#39;s reason for doing a homam is different from the old times. W=\r\nhen one does a fire ritual,=A0one does one&#39;s dharma towards the universe an=\r\nd, at the same time, improves one&#39;s own internal bhootaagni a little bit.\n=\r\n=A0\nFor doing any spiritual activity - japam or tarpana or just reading a s=\r\ncripture or contemplation - strong bhootaagni is very important for interna=\r\nlizing and digesting the experience spiritually. If a person with a very we=\r\nak or extinguished bhootaagni does such spiritual activities, the impact is=\r\n negligible. As a person&#39;s bhootaagni is maximized immediately following a =\r\nritual with an external fire, it helps one do a better job with other spiri=\r\ntual activities.\n=A0\nThus, my recommendation is the same as Narayan&#39;s. Do h=\r\nomam, meditate as the poornaahuti burns and then do tarpana. In fact, if yo=\r\nu are only doing deva and rishi tarpanas, you can even integrate it with ho=\r\nmam. You can do deva and rishi tarpanas while sitting in front of the fire,=\r\n after the uttaraangam and before the poornaahuti, and then go on to offer =\r\npoornaahuti. However, if you also want to include pitris (deceased ancestor=\r\ns) along with devas and rishis, I suggest doing it separately after the hom=\r\nam.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nI want to narra=\r\nte an incident related to tarpana manuals.\n=A0\nManish thinks very highly of=\r\n tarpana and asked me to create a manual for it last year. In the case of h=\r\nomam, I studied and practiced several approaches and experienced some thing=\r\ns internally and knew what I was talking about, before the homam manuals we=\r\nre created. In case of tarpana, my experience and internal understanding wa=\r\ns limited when I created the manuals. Though I had Manish&#39;s blessings, I ha=\r\nd some doubts=A0on whether what I consolidated (as 3 options) was good enou=\r\ngh or not. On the day chosen for making the manuals available, I did my Cha=\r\nndi homam in the morning and prayed to the 18-handed Mahalakshmi/ Durga ido=\r\nl I use for homam, &quot;O Mother, I was very comfortable with homam manuals, bu=\r\nt my experience in tarpana is limited. But Manish asked me to create and di=\r\nstribute tarpana manuals. Several important people may be using these manua=\r\nls in future. If what I consolidated is good and you approve it, please giv=\r\ne me some signal today as I perform the\n procedure. I will understand. I wi=\r\nll publish them only if you give your approval.&quot;\n=A0\nThen I sat down to per=\r\nform tarpanas. The moment I invoked gods and rishis into the kalasha, there=\r\n was such a powerful wind outside (the windows were open). The sound of the=\r\n wind was really loud. I started deva tarpana and said &quot;brahmaa tripyataam&quot;=\r\n and left water. Then I took water into my palm again and said &quot;vishnuh tri=\r\npyataam&quot;. As soon as I left that water, I heard big thup-thup sounds from o=\r\nutside. When I lifted my head to see through the window, I saw that heavy r=\r\nain with really big drops had just started. It did not rain in the previous=\r\n 10 days and there were no noticeable clouds in the sky that morning. It wa=\r\ns very sunny and bright until then. But a heavy rain started as soon as tar=\r\npana started and the rain continued till the end of the day.\n=A0\nI took the=\r\n wind and the rain as signals of approval from the Mother, thanked her at t=\r\nhe end=A0and went ahead to publish the manuals. As I performed the ritual m=\r\nore times later, I slowly understood the real meaning and purpose of tarpan=\r\na. For many people with weak minds that are afflicted by rinas to deceased =\r\nancestors with mental weaknesses, tarpana is a very very useful ritual. I n=\r\now fully understand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matter, emphasized =\r\nperforming both homam and tarpana and how they supplement each other. I am =\r\nglad that more people are considering performing a quick homam and a quick =\r\ntarpana on a regular basis.

I now fully understand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matt=\r\ner, emphasized performing both homam and tarpana and how they supplement ea=\r\nch other. I am glad that more people are considering performing a quick hom=\r\nam and a quick tarpana on a regular basis. Even a combination of&nbsp;a 30-=\r\nminute homam and a 5-minute tarpana performed daily will go a long way in f=\r\nreeing one.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath=\r\n.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dkritels@=\r\nyahoo.com href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dkritels@ya=\r\nhoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:kritels@...=\r\n&quot;&gt;krishna Kanth&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A ti=\r\ntle=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/m=\r\nc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, Augu=\r\nst 27, 2009 10:19 AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Query regarding Homam / Tarpanam&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacin=\r\ng=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sri N=\r\narasimha Garu,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskaram.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If one has to do both Homam and Tarpanam daily, what would be you=\r\nr suggestion in terms of which would be the order one has to perform both..=\r\n is it that first do homam and then Tarpanam or vice versa or it does&nbsp;=\r\n not matter?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;I have downloaded the all tarpana manuals from the website and thinking t=\r\no start off with super short process from the coming poornima day.
