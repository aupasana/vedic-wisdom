He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in =\r\nshame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summe=\r\nrs, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is =\r\ntrying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in =\r\nthe winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers w=\r\ne abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face=\r\n, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wan=\r\nts to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, a=\r\nnd apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you k=\r\nnow, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;yo=\r\nu&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line w=\r\nas a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, ye=\r\nt in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since=\r\n that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all=\r\n because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which =\r\nleads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him=\r\n, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no=\r\n gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true =\r\nlove it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one=\r\n shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about p=\r\neople outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond fa=\r\nvorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she =\r\ndidn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, h=\r\ne is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him,=\r\n rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost=\r\n in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these character=\r\ns, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form=\r\n of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of h=\r\ner from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s =\r\nrule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya auka=\r\nad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mu=\r\njhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far =\r\nmore insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then =\r\nhe went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo=\r\nve????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, ano=\r\nther\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. Al=\r\nl I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I =\r\nask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will b=\r\ne delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become b=\r\nig enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai,=\r\n who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself sh=\r\nould come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather pre=\r\nfer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, becaus=\r\ne if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I need to =\r\ndo,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri =\r\nkari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if th=\r\ne results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are=\r\n god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, =\r\nyou won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me.

He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master , to brin=\r\ng him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy,=\r\n his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy.=\r\n Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Equate d=\r\noggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are nev=\r\ner happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butte=\r\nr chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale he=\r\nro, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo go=\r\npaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconscious=\r\nly want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never wan=\r\nt food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, wh=\r\ny are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, a=\r\nlways SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji bring=\r\ns us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, =\r\nbut we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought=\r\n. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the great =\r\ndogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is =\r\nmental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if y=\r\nou become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oye h=\r\noye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

He was getting irritated with the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you wa=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked dow=\r\nn in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in =\r\nsummers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my bod=\r\ny is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for hi=\r\nm in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summ=\r\ners we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his=\r\n face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, h=\r\ne wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbl=\r\ned, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, =\r\nyou know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I lov=\r\ne &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (That last l=\r\nine was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the su=\r\nn, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and =\r\nsince that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, afte=\r\nr all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen w=\r\nhich leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Withou=\r\nt him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s=\r\n , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, =\r\ntrue love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t giv=\r\ne one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking ab=\r\nout people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite =\r\na few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respo=\r\nnd favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because=\r\n she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Del=\r\nhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with=\r\n him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is=\r\n lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these char=\r\nacters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen=\r\n form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask=\r\n of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhna=\r\nth&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya=\r\n aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiy=\r\ne, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is=\r\n far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThen he went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right=\r\n, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sak=\r\ne. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but da=\r\nre I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it w=\r\nill be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i bec=\r\nome big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam=\r\n hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herse=\r\nlf should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rathe=\r\nr prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, b=\r\necause if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can =\r\nthen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. I=\r\nf you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That do=\r\nesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I nee=\r\nd to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki na=\r\nukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even =\r\nif the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, the=\r\ny are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surren=\r\nder, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. It=\r\ns a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 2=\r\n5000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greates=\r\nt men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained=\r\n be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees =\r\nhis master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master , to=\r\n bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is h=\r\nappy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is h=\r\nappy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Equ=\r\nate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We ar=\r\ne never happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expecting =\r\nbutter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waa=\r\nle hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bo=\r\nlo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subcons=\r\nciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I neve=\r\nr want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want hi=\r\nm, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish do=\r\ngs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji =\r\nbrings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that m=\r\nilk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his th=\r\nought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the g=\r\nreat dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nope. Tha=\r\nt is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sir,=\r\n if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\noye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.
