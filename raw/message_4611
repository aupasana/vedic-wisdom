One\nevening, I went to the Shrine of Sri Subramanya and stood for half an=\r\n hour\nbefore the Moolavar (main deity) and the following words flashed into=\r\n my\nconsciousness: &quot;Here I am a God who does not talk. Go to Tiruvannamalai=\r\n;\nMaharshi is a God who talks.&quot; This was how Maharshi&#39;s Grace manifested\nit=\r\nself to me. I had not even seen Maharshi then.\n\nIn December 1932, I wrote t=\r\no Ramanasramam and got the reply conveying\nBhagavan&#39;s upadesa that the body=\r\n is the result of prarabdha (accumulated\nkarma) and the joys and sorrows re=\r\nlating to it are inevitable and they can\nbe borne easily if we put the burd=\r\nen on God.\n\nIn 1933, one day, Vakil Sri Vaikuntam Venkatarama Iyer suddenly=\r\n spoke to me\nabout Maharshi and gave me a copy of Ramana Vijayam in Tamil. =\r\nI read it and\nwhen I came to the part when his mother was crying before him=\r\n to urge him to\nreturn home I was choked with tears.\n\nThen my mother made t=\r\nhe following inspired utterance.&quot;Malaiappan calls you;\ngo to him. This path=\r\n will result in the salvation of twenty-seven\ngenerations of your family. T=\r\nhis is the upadesa (teaching) of Mother Truth.\nGo along this path. Any obst=\r\nacle you meet, regard as maya (illusion). You\nwill soon be liberated.&quot; So s=\r\naying, I was given upadesa of Mahavakyam and\nKarana-Panchaksharam (Vedic tr=\r\nuth of Brahman).\n\nIn February 1933, I wrote to the Ashram again and got a p=\r\nrompt reply.\nBhagavan&#39;s upadesa given in it was as follows: &quot;Sattvic food w=\r\nill keep the\nmind clear and help meditation. This is the experience of sadh=\r\nakas. Eat to\nappease hunger and not to satisfy taste or craving; this will =\r\nin due course\nlead to the control of the senses. Then continued and concent=\r\nrated\nmeditation will result in annihilation of desires.&quot; It is the Atman t=\r\nhat\nactivates the mind and breath. Watching the breath will result in keval=\r\na\nkumbakam (stopping of breath). Control of breath will lead to temporary\nc=\r\nontrol of the mind and vice versa. Intense and constant japa (repetition of=\r\n\na sacred syllable) will lead to ajapa (non-repetition). Sound being subtle=\r\nr\nthan form, japa is preferable to murti (image or form) or worship. Aham\nB=\r\nrahmasmi (I am Brahman ) is the best. To those who seek the source of the\n`=\r\nI&#39; no other mantra or upasana (meditation) is needed.&quot;\n\nWithin a month afte=\r\nr the receipt of this, I proceeded to Ramanasramam to\nstay there permanentl=\r\ny. One day I decided to spend the nights for one\nmandala (cycle of 48 days)=\r\n in the presence of Bhagavan. On the 15th day I\nhad a dream: The attendant =\r\nMadhavan had an epileptic attack and suddenly\ngrasped my hand. I cried for =\r\nhelp to Bhagavan who pulled away Madhavan&#39;s\nhand, and gave me milk to drink=\r\n. When I woke up I still had the taste of the\nmilk in my mouth; I felt I ha=\r\nd drunk the milk of wisdom. From then onward my\nmind turned inwards.\n\nOne m=\r\norning while cutting vegetables, I wanted to do giri pradakshinam\n(circumam=\r\nbulation of the Hill) and asked Bhagavan&#39;s permission. Devotees\nnearby made=\r\n signs pleading to Bhagavan not to let me go. Bhagavan said, &quot;Is\npradakshin=\r\na a sankalpa (intention)? Let him go.&quot; I said, &quot;No. I decided last\nnight to=\r\n go with somebody. That is all.&quot; Bhagavan, &quot;Oh! You already made the\nsankal=\r\npa. Sankalpa leads to samsara. Fulfil the sankalpa . You need not cut\nveget=\r\nables.&quot; I took it as an upadesa (teaching) not to make sankalpas\nthereafter=\r\n.\n\nAnother morning when I was cutting vegetables with Bhagavan, he said:\n&quot;S=\r\nundaram! Take this hurricane light and pick up the mangoes that have\nfallen=\r\n from the tree.&quot; I said &quot;Yes&quot;, but continued cutting up the\nvegetables. Bha=\r\ngavan said, &quot;Sundaram! Attend to what `I&#39; said first. It is\nfrom me that ev=\r\nerything rises. Attend to it first.&quot; I took this as an adesh\nand upadesa (a=\r\ndvice and instruction) to make the enquiry &quot;Who am I?&quot; My\nfriends also felt=\r\n so.\n\nOne day the attendant Madhavan was binding a book. A devotee wanted a=\r\n book\nfrom the library. Bhagavan asked Madhavan to get it saying, &quot;You do m=\r\ny work;\nI will do your work.&quot; And Bhagavan took the book and went on with t=\r\nhe\nbinding while Madhavan got the library book. A devotee interpreted this =\r\nas\nfollows: &quot;My work means looking after the needs which arise in the minds=\r\n of\ndevotees for anything from Bhagavan. Your work is to get liberation whi=\r\nch is\nnot possible without Bhagavan&#39;s Grace and help.&quot; Bhagavan heard this =\r\ncomment\nand said &quot;Hum Hum! That is what it is !&quot;\n\nOnce when meditating in t=\r\nhe presence of Bhagavan, the mind persisted in\nwandering. I couldn&#39;t contro=\r\nl it. So I gave up meditation and opened my\neyes. Bhagavan at once sat up a=\r\nnd said, &quot;Oh! You abandon it thinking it is\nthe swabhava (nature) of the mi=\r\nnd to wander. Whatever we practise becomes\nthe swabhava. If control is prac=\r\ntised persistently that will become the\nswabhava.&quot; Yet another upadesa for =\r\nme.\n\nSources:\n\n1) http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/slg/slg0=\r\n11.html\n2) Arunachala&#39;s Ramana Volume III Book\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636163fb7d99a1c048a4e78a3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;WHEN I was in Tiruchendur in 1932 it came to my mind that I should regar=\r\nd all women as my mother or Valli if I was intent on leading a spiritual li=\r\nfe.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0One evening, I went to the Shrine of Sri Subramanya and sto=\r\nod for half an hour before the Moolavar (main deity) and the following word=\r\ns flashed into my consciousness: &quot;Here I am a God who does not talk.
