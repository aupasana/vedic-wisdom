I currently=\r\n do 3-5 repetitions after my sitting down japa every day. But I admit it wo=\r\nuld be very challenging to do an extra half hour japa every day this month,=\r\n in addition to my current 45 min sit down japa practice- mainly because of=\r\n my continuously changing working hours, and lack of consistent routine fro=\r\nm week to week.  \n&gt; \n&gt; However I will join you in your Mahamrityunjaya wors=\r\nhip to the best of my ability. For the past few weeks, I have been thinking=\r\n about doing a Mahamrityunjaya havan every week for my patients. Your decis=\r\nion to do japa of this mantra has inspired me to take some action on this. =\r\nFor the next 4 weeks, while you are doing your japa, I will do Mahamrityunj=\r\naya havan every weekend- for the wellbeing of my patients and all beings in=\r\n general. \n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, I will make a start with this project this weekend=\r\n- tomorrow will be the first havan. This is a happy weekend for me in gener=\r\nal, because I will complete 250,000 repetitions of Om Namo Narayanaya today=\r\n- I will be doing a Vishnu havan after this today to celebrate. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns for the inspiration LakshmiNarayanji. :) Please keep us updated on your p=\r\nlans with the Mahamrityunjaya japa....hope it goes well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Aparna \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan=\r\n &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Aparnaji,\n&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 My deep thanks for sending this lovingkind healing =\r\nenergy.

Last year I started this one but due to lot of tension and other thin=\r\ngs gave up. I know many people can do lac japa in 40 days or early.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I want to do 501 every day. It takes me 30/35 minutes. So it will take, s=\r\nay about 25/26 days. I do not do haven but as you are doing it it will be a=\r\nmazing for you to do, at the end of it, if you have never done it on your o=\r\nwn.
