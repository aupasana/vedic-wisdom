At that time I made mp3 of atharv shirsham from your mahaganapati homam=\r\n video and got a pleasant satisfaction/contentment/serenity in listening to=\r\n your chanting. If i am not wrong i could sense that somehow the consciousn=\r\ness of the person chanting affects strotra.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I had mailed you that cop=\r\ny with request to make it available for all on your site, I didn&#39;t share or=\r\n uploaded it as I didn&#39;t have your permission)\n&gt; \n&gt; For last 2 days I got a=\r\n great urge to ask you again for LNH chanting with a note that I might have=\r\n to ask through devi first. Guess I jumped the note part. So dont listen to=\r\n your inner voice for next few days, let me talk to devi first. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Rat=\r\nher than going for simpler alternative, I would rather request devi to pers=\r\nuade you. \n&gt; \n&gt; But its nice to know that these kind of samput are allowed.=\r\n Ofcourse its better if these directions come from some serious sadhak rath=\r\ner than ones own inclination.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Priyank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My fri=\r\nend,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi Narayana Hridayas are supposed to be kept secretive. =\r\nI am not \n&gt; &gt; even supposed to mention their existence or my use of those o=\r\nr share \n&gt; &gt; their texts publicly.
