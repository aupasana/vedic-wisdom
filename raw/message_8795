He discusses the failure of atheism,=\r\n the dangers of fundamentalism and the need for genuine Dharma based spirit=\r\nuality. Extending from this Sri Acharyaji considers a very wide range of so=\r\ncial and political issues from a Dharma perspective. You may not agree with=\r\n all of his perspectives but they will challenge you to reconsider your pos=\r\nition on many of these issues rather than taking the conventional secular p=\r\narty line. Sri Acharyaji considers each issue in terms of the Dharma and in=\r\n relation to the society and the spiritual growth of the individual. This i=\r\ns a fascinating work offering a revolutionary approach to political and soc=\r\nial issues based within the spiritual framework of Tradition and the Dharma=\r\n. It is certainly thought provoking and invites us to &#39;think outside the bo=\r\nx&#39; for the betterment of ourselves and mankind.&quot;\n\n- Living Traditions Magaz=\r\nine\n\n\n&quot;Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya is certainly very intelligent and know=\r\nledgeable in many important areas of modern life and culture. His writing i=\r\nn this book is concise and very clear. As would be expected with any kind o=\r\nf &#39;manifesto,&#39; the ideas he puts forth in this book are meant to be revolut=\r\nionary, which he defines as, &#39;=85proactive and constructive in nature, rath=\r\ner than merely utopian or reactionary.&#39; Many folks might be turned off by t=\r\nhat approach to change, but in this work the manner of presenting his views=\r\n is actually quite balanced and intense, but neither idealistic nor emotion=\r\nal.&quot; \n\n- J.M. Jordan\n\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya&#39;s most historically gr=\r\noundbreaking politico-philosophical work, &quot;The Dharma Manifesto&quot;, is now of=\r\nfered to the world at a time when its people are most desperately crying ou=\r\nt for fundamental change.\n\nGet your copy today:\n\nhttp://www.lulu.com/spotli=\r\nght/DharmaNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
