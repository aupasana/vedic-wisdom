Temples are\nthe=\r\n agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all\npl=\r\naces. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our\ngratitu=\r\nde to God.\n\nThat which is within all, which is seen as &quot;This&quot; is the source=\r\n. He who is\nwithin and sees as &quot;This&quot; is God. It is the reality. It is in y=\r\nourself. What\nis limited is Sadhana; what is unlimited is the end.\n\nHe alon=\r\ne is an Acharya, who, after clearly understanding the conclusive\nteachings =\r\nof the Sastras, makes the people of the world gain their welfare\nby making =\r\nthem stick to the path shown in the Sastras and also himself does\neverythin=\r\ng according to Sastras and remains in that experience.\n\nMany acts relating =\r\nto God, like building temples, digging tanks are\nperformed. While executing=\r\n them, there would be many difficulties. There\nwould come also several kind=\r\ns of dishonour. Not minding any of these, they\nwould complete their tasks w=\r\nith mental one-pointedness removing impurities\nfrom their minds and letting=\r\n the mind wander. By straightening their mind,\nthey acquire mind control an=\r\nd at the end, they realise the Reality that is\nto be known. Digging tanks, =\r\nbuilding temples and such other acts are called\npoorttam. The performance o=\r\nf sacrifices, etc., is known as ishtam. Combining\nthese two, we have the wo=\r\nrd Ishtapoortam.\n In all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need=\r\n must be with\nreference to another. Let action be out of love. Passions suc=\r\nh as desire and\nhatred , anger and malice must be totally eschewed. If love=\r\n becomes the\ngrounding principle of all deeds . then most of the ills of th=\r\ne world will\nvanish.\n\nWe know many faults we commit, even if others do not =\r\nknow them. Sometimes we\nrealise we are doing so many evil things and repent=\r\n bitterly and feel why we\nshould be born . Our duty is to pray to God -&quot;I h=\r\nave committed so many\nfaults. Will you not, 0 God, give me the will power n=\r\not do like that in\nfuture and will you not purify my mind?&quot; We must note do=\r\nwn in a diary every\nnight before we go to bed the faults committed by us an=\r\nd pray to God to give\nus courage and intelligence not to do so. This must b=\r\ne propagated widely.\n\nParameswara and Sriman Narayana are one and the same =\r\nin reality. They are\nnot two. This is the conclusive view of all the sastra=\r\ns. Names differ, forms\nare different, occupations vary, but the reality whi=\r\nch is within Them is one\nand the same.\n What is the purpose of human birth?=\r\n To earn, to eat, to undergo misery\neveryday and finally to die? Instead of=\r\n earning and suffering, can we not\ndie now? The purpose of birth is to avoi=\r\nd re-birth. Except man, all animals\ngrow horizontally. Only man grows verti=\r\ncally. Instead of growing\nhorizontally, it is God&#39;s will that he should gro=\r\nw vertically in order to\nlook up. God has given to animals devices for self=\r\n-protection; to man alone\nHe has given intelligence. By doing nothing, we a=\r\nvoid re-birth; By giving up\nattachment, we avoid sins.\n\nWhen any object is =\r\nconsumed by fire, it becomes charred. If that black\nresidue is burnt again,=\r\n it becomes white ash. White ash continues to remain\nwhite even when burnt =\r\nagain. This shows that white is the ultimate and black\nis proximate to it. =\r\nScience tells us that diamond and coal are basically\none. White and black a=\r\nre not colours. The primary colours get separated from\nthe objects to which=\r\n they are attached when subjected to the test of fire\nand ultimately white.=\r\n Similarly, in the mental and spiritual place, the\nUltimate Reality is Siva=\r\n, who is white and proximate to Him is Parvati, who\nis dark. When we test e=\r\nverything in the fire of Jnana, or true knowledge,\nthe residue is Siva. Ash=\r\n in the material plane corresponds to Siva in the\nspiritual plane. We smear=\r\n our bodies with the sacred ash to remind ourselves\nof Siva and the fact th=\r\nat the ultimate goal of life is Siva.\n\nMuch is said about the personal God =\r\nand the impersonal absolute God with\nattributes and without attributes. It =\r\nis only when all the colours in the\nlight mix together that we get the colo=\r\nurless rays of the sun. Similarly by\nthe very virtue of being the abode of =\r\nattributes, God becomes Nirguna,\nattribute-less.\n\nBy education we realise T=\r\nruth. There are many truths, History is one truth.\nGeography is one truth, =\r\nMathematics is one truth. The content of truth is\nthe greatest in Mathemati=\r\ncs. In others, there is an element of imagination.\nIn Geography, we come ac=\r\nross names Asia, Africa, Madras, Calcutta, etc.\nThese names were given by u=\r\ns. By imagination, we have given names &quot;plateau&quot;\n&quot;valley&quot;, etc. By a proces=\r\ns of gradual elimination of all that is imaginary,\nwhen we arrive at truth,=\r\n that Truth is found to be God. To think of Him with\nreal devotion is the f=\r\nruit of education.\n\nWhat is the use of education? Its first use is to devel=\r\nop humility (vinaya).\nIn olden days, the disciple who went to a guru was ca=\r\nlled &quot;vineyan&quot; meaning\na person of humility which is the hall-mark of Instr=\r\nuction he had from his\nguru, the fruit of education. Education without humi=\r\nlity is no education.\nEducation is the same today as it was before, but met=\r\nhods have changed. The\nmedicine is the same but if the diet is changed, the=\r\n medicine becomes\npoison. Education has today become merely the means of li=\r\nvelihood. For true\neducation, the student should go to a guru and follow th=\r\ne guru-kula system.\n\nRight education should make us know that God is the Tr=\r\nuth. Knowledge must\nfill one with good qualities, through which one can rea=\r\nlise the Truth, that\nis God. Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the unders=\r\ntanding of the\nUltimate Truth. The first fruit of education must be humilit=\r\ny and self\ncontrol.\n\nThe total surrender to the Lord is a means of learning=\r\n our insignificance\nand the transcendent grace of the Lord.\n\nIf we engage a=\r\nn inquiry into the Atman, at the end of it, it will be clear\nthat God is in=\r\n us as our very self. When that stage is reached, we have no\nuse for the de=\r\nvas. Then all karmas will fall away from us. But, until then,\nwe must oblig=\r\natorily do the karmas directing them to the Gods.\n\nThose who are the leader=\r\ns of a group, society, or state should not neglect\nthe established religiou=\r\ns customs and usages. For themselves the may mot be\nin need of Church cerem=\r\nonies, for instance, their advance in spirituality\nmay not require them. Bu=\r\nt if they begin to neglect them, the people for whom\nthe rituals are really=\r\n helpful, will also start neglecting them. This would\nbe setting a bad exam=\r\nple. In the words of the Bhagavad Gita, the wise one\nshould not unsettle th=\r\ne minds of those who are ignorant, and are attached to\naction: on the contr=\r\nary, he should encourage them to perform what they\nshould perform, by himse=\r\nlf doing the appropriate actions well and with\ndiligence. It is duty cast u=\r\npon the leaders and those that are at the top to\nlead the people from where=\r\n they are, and not to refrain from participation\nin the traditional ways of=\r\n worship.\n\nOf all scriptures, the Gita has acquired a specialty of its own.=\r\n Like this,\nthere are many other books of wisdom. In the Mahabharata, there=\r\n are many\nchapters teaching wisdom. Besides, in the Sivapurana, Vishnupuran=\r\na,\nSkandham, etc., there is Jnanopadesa.\n\nSo also in agamas. But what is th=\r\ne special importance of Gita due to? Not\nonly in our country but in countri=\r\nes like Java, people follow the Gita. My\ninference is that because it was b=\r\norn in an atmosphere utterly free from\nattachment - attachment to life, att=\r\nachment to body, attachment to kith and\nkin, but out of attachment only to =\r\nReality, it has become so famous.\n\nOn deep consideration, ahimsa appears to=\r\n be good as an ideal or for\npreaching. But practically speaking, it is diff=\r\nicult to follow fully. First\nof all, we must love others. But if we love an=\r\nyone too much, the end is\nsorrow. Therefore we should love God who always g=\r\nives happiness and not\nsorrow. I ask myself if we love God, should we not l=\r\nove anyone else in this\nworld? So long as there is false knowledge which di=\r\nstinguishes God from the\nrest of the world, there will be differences. If w=\r\ne attain Jnana that God is\nall, we will develop the same love for all that =\r\nwe have for God; This is the\nsign of Ahimsa.\n\nFor the sake of food, clothin=\r\ng and shelter, everyone is toiling and\nsorrow-stricken. If sorrow is to be =\r\nbanished and if we are to be ever happy,\nwe must dedicate all our actions t=\r\no God. If we get His grace, then we need\nnot do anything and can be happy. =\r\nGod is a good master. By praising Him\nalways, we cannot please Him. He is i=\r\nndifferent to our praise or dispraise,\naction or inaction. But all our acti=\r\nons are ordained by Him and are meant\nonly to purify our minds.\n\nWhy so man=\r\ny Gods? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak\nof one God=\r\n only and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to\nsatisfy hunge=\r\nr, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger.\nThen why can&#39;t =\r\nwe take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side\ndishes? So, if we=\r\n eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food\ntasty to the pal=\r\nate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a\nparticular God he w=\r\norships that.\n\nSource: http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50.html\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b14ca383df5d0480e10b97\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;The medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows is to develop unshakable=\r\n faith in God and tolerance is the medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrow=\r\ns.

If sor=\r\nrow is to be banished and if we are to be ever happy, we must dedicate all =\r\nour actions to God. If we get His grace, then we need not do anything and c=\r\nan be happy. God is a good master. By praising Him always, we cannot please=\r\n Him. He is indifferent to our praise or dispraise, action or inaction. But=\r\n all our actions are ordained by Him and are meant only to purify our minds=\r\n.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why so many Gods? Is it not enough to have onl=\r\ny one? Other religions speak of one God only and not many. We are assailed =\r\nby such doubts. We eat to satisfy hunger, the stomach becomes full, there i=\r\ns no trouble or hunger. Then why can&#39;t we take cooked rice alone? Why s=\r\nhould we eat so many side dishes? So, if we eat, it is just not to fill the=\r\n stomach, but we want food tasty to the palate and pleasing to the eyes. Wh=\r\noever is attracted to a particular God he worships that.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.kamakoti=\r\n.org/miscl/divine50.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=\r\n=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636b14ca383df5d0480e10b97--\r\n\n"}}
