There may be something in this=\r\n dream to aid your own spiritual progress. Except that, I do not think the =\r\ndream means much literally.\n\n* * *\n\nMy take is that this dream is a message=\r\n to you to start doing pitri tarpana. Pitri tarpana (meaning: satisfying an=\r\ncestral manes) is a procedure that can be finished in 5-10 min in its short=\r\nest form. In fact, a short pitri tarpana used to be an integral part of dai=\r\nly religious sadhana every morning, not so long ago.\n\n* * *\n\nOne can downlo=\r\nad free Pitri tarpana manuals at\n\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n\nT=\r\nhe manuals explain in detail three versions of the procedure - super-short =\r\n(5-10 min), short (12-20 min) and regular (30-45 min). Manuals are availabl=\r\ne with mantras given in various scripts (English, Sanskrit, Bengali, Gujara=\r\nti, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu).\n\n* * *\n\nIf a pitri or anc=\r\nestral mane is stuck in pitri loka, it affects one&#39;s mind. Suppose a lustfu=\r\nl ancestor got stuck upon death in pitri loka (i.e. the realm of consciousn=\r\ness where mind and its predispositions dominate), instead of progressing to=\r\n another realm of consciousness or being reborn to fulfil remaining desires=\r\n. Then minds of some descendants may be genetically/ kaarmically predispose=\r\nd to lust. Same with other weaknesses.\n\nThough one can look at a pitri as a=\r\nn external being, everything external maps internally. One&#39;s pitris are pre=\r\nsent within one as various tendencies based on genetic and kaarmik predispo=\r\nsitions. Freeing a pitri and granting him rebirth is essentially the same a=\r\ns freeing one&#39;s own mind from certain genetic and kaarmik predispositions.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nIn astrology, horas in hora chart are ruled by Sun (fire) or Moon (=\r\nwater). Sun&#39;s horas are controlled by devas (gods) and Moon&#39;s horas are con=\r\ntrolled by pitris (ancestral manes).\n\nWe all have a physical body (lagna), =\r\na mind (Moon) and a soul (Sun). Pitris are beings that self-identify more s=\r\ntrongly with the mind (Moon) and they are best propitiated using the medium=\r\n of water (tarpana). Devas are beings that self-identify more strongly with=\r\n the soul (Sun) and they are best propitiated using the medium of fire (hom=\r\nam).\n\nIf one does a 30-minute homam to any deity (e.g. Ganapathi) and a 10-=\r\nminute pitri tarpana everyday (or every weekend), it can accelerate one&#39;s s=\r\npiritual progress and make everything else one does more effective. In fact=\r\n, a fire ritual and a tarpana were part of the daily routine of learned Hin=\r\ndus not long ago.\n\n* * *\n\nModern world looks down upon rituals, but rituals=\r\n are externalized actions that are carefully designed and that eventually b=\r\nring internal transformation on repetition.\n\nEvery action and every thought=\r\n of ours has an impact and leaves an imprint on our consciousness. If we wa=\r\nnt to shape our consciousness in a particular useful way, some repeated act=\r\nions coupled with some thoughts can be used.\n\nThinking of stuck ancestors a=\r\nnd praying for their freedom, while water flows over some important energy =\r\ncenters in the palm, is certainly a useful exercise. Contemplating a deity =\r\nwhile imagining him/her in fire is certainly a useful exercise.\n\n* * *\n\nThe=\r\n decrease of dharma and increase of adharma in the world places our earth i=\r\nn a precarious position. Though very patient, Mother Earth cannot let her c=\r\nhildren destroy themselves with their careless actions that ruin earth and =\r\nirresponsible inaction in important matters. If Mother Earth takes correcti=\r\nve action to change the course, it will be painful for many people. For cha=\r\nnges to occur smoothly and relatively painlessly, we need to maintain a cer=\r\ntain level of dharma in the world.\n\nIf a few thousands of people are doing =\r\nhomam to various deities on a regular basis, without any selfish material m=\r\notivations but to just increase dharma in the world and to progress spiritu=\r\nally in the process, it will make a big difference to the world.\n\nIn fact, =\r\nthe divine Mother appeared and asked my guru in March 2006 to teach simple =\r\nhomam procedures to anybody who is interested in spiritual progress and hel=\r\np increase dharma in the world. I see that some people who never even lit a=\r\n lamp in their lives are doing a daily homam today and I am convinced that =\r\nthe Mother&#39;s will will be fulfilled in time.\n\nDetailed manuals of a short h=\r\nomam ritual to various deities are available at:\n\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\n\n* * *\n\nInterestingly, I was thinking a few days back to write =\r\na few lines about the importance of pitri tarpana and homam on yahoogroups.=\r\n Your mail gives me the opportunity. .\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- -\n\n--- In vedic-astrology@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;dghole1971&quot; &lt;dghol=\r\ne1971@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Gam Ganapataye Namah ||\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Learned Scho=\r\nlars,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering to the significance of this dream that I had abo=\r\nut 3\n&gt; nights ago around 5:00 AM.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the dream, I saw Shri Vishnu info=\r\nrming the Pitris that soon on a\n&gt; particular day the Pitris will be able to=\r\n communicate with their living\n&gt; descendents and impart knowledge about wha=\r\nt we can to do to help the\n&gt; Pitris move on.
