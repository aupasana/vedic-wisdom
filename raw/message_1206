Praise and criticism are both merely a set of words \nexpressing certain feelings generated by a play of karmas between persons. \nThere is no need to be sensitive. If discussing anything helps one fulfil \none&#39;s dharma, one can do it. Otherwise, it is a distraction and a waste of \ntime.\n\n*        *        *\n\nPeople are criticizing Mitesh&#39;s perceived tone and attitude. That is \nsubjective and irrelevant to growing our knowledge/wisdom. What is relevant \nis an important point he indirectly raised: what is the role of scripture vs \nintuition/judgment/interpretation of people? Though there was some confusion \nbetween him and me on what he asked and what I was saying etc, we can lay it \nto rest. The thing to *take forward* is the question of word of scripture vs \ninterpretation based on one&#39;s intuition.\n\nI want to share my thoughts using a simple analogy.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWord of scripture is like raw rice or wheat. You cannot eat and digest raw \nrice or wheat. You need someone to cook it and give you cooked food. \nHowever, cooked food cannot be stored for too long. It will get spoiled. So \nyou can only store raw food. When you need to eat it, you need to cook it.\n\nSimilarly, scripture only stores raw (uncooked) knowledge. This is done for \na purpose. If interpreted knowledge is stored, it becomes stale or spoiled \nor corrupted with time. So it is wise (and possible) to only store raw and \nuncooked knowledge.\n\nIf raw rice is stored in a nice container, someone has to cook it for you so \nthat you can eat it. Similarly, the raw knowledge in scriptures has to be \nprocessed in the internal fire of a learned person to be fit for consumption \nby people [though I do not consider myself a learned person, my guru gave me \na responsibility and an assurance. I operate on that basis]. Depending on \nhow good the fire is, the food may be properly cooked or improperly cooked \n(and inappropriate for consumption). But the bottomline is that the words of \nscripture have to be interpreted by someone well, for them to be useful.\n\nOf course, the food one cooks may appeal to some and not appeal to others. \nSimilarly, when one processes raw knowledge in one&#39;s internal fire and \noffers the processed knowledge to others, some will be drawn towards it and \nlike it and some will not like it.\n\nBut many people liking some food does not make it good food. It may be bad \nfor health or cause indigestion or be junk food. The goodness of the food \nwill be proved when people digest it well and get strength from it.\n\nSimilarly, the presence on this list of several people who take a liking to \nmy writings and admire me does not mean anything. It is just a play of \nkarmas. IF some of them benefit from my writings, have an internal \ntransformation and start making spiritual progress, then my writings will \nhave served a purpose and then it will suggest that I succeeded in &quot;cooking&quot; \nthe knowedge of scriptures well.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThere was more I wanted to write, but I have to stop for tonight.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n&gt; Namaste Mitesh,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am sure you are not blaming Narasimha but your way of expression\n&gt; clearly shows that you are not familiar with his writings. I had\nthe\n&gt; good fortune of observing him and his writings for over a decade\nnow\n&gt; and I have seen no other person who is as crystal clear in his\n&gt; writings and who is as mindful of his responsibilities and who is\nas\n&gt; etiquette as Narasimha is. He almost never answers unless he feels\n&gt; that what he is going to write is useful not only to the person\nwho\n&gt; has asked the query but to many more. All his posts are very\n&gt; thorough, informative and I for one believe that not only the\npeople\n&gt; in this group but also others who will have the good fortune of\n&gt; seeing his posting in the future will benefit immensely from these\n&gt; postings on the net. When I look at the development and\n&gt; transformation that he has gone through in this period, it amazes\nme\n&gt; to no end. Initially he was (of course still is) a scholar of\nVedic\n&gt; astrology and later is developing in to a spiritual giant. In all\n&gt; these years, he has unselfishly contributed to whatever he takes\nup\n&gt; and made it a point to spread the knowledge all around for the\n&gt; benefit of the humanity in general.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know Narasimha will not appreciate this mail as it contains no\n&gt; valuable information for the seekers and it might sound as though\nI\n&gt; am praising him. My intention is not that, for I believe he has\nrisen\n&gt; above accolade.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can certainly make requests or even oppose/question his\nwritings\n&gt; and can extend other opinions that you may have, in a way that\nwill\n&gt; not offend the members of the group. Particularly the\nparagraph &quot;We\n&gt; eat.&quot; is not at all in good taste, although Utpal has taken them\nas\n&gt; hilarious comments, which shows his magnanimity. It clearly shows\n&gt; your lack of understanding of the context and level of Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; spiritual attainments.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have never written in support of anyone so far nor do I have the\n&gt; habit of participating in the discussions on the various groups. I\n&gt; have been a silent member, as many are, reading the wonderful\n&gt; writings of people like Narasimha and trying to learn from them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope I have not offended you with my comments, I just felt like\n&gt; butting in! I know Narasimha does not need support of anyone, much\n&gt; less from me:-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; RJ\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not blaming him.

That\nin\n&gt; &gt; turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal\nfire\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receiving food right now. That in turn decides which\ntongues\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external fire are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The external fire is a mirror to your internal state. An\n&gt; adept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be able to detect, looking at the fire, which tongues of\nfire\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; active right now and hence guess the state your mind is in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, trying to pay too much attention to this\n&gt; &gt; technicality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and becoming over-conscious of the nature of fire is\n&gt; unneeded.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external can be used to manipulate the internal (within\nsome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; limits),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it can become a distraction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether internal follows external or external follows\n&gt; internal\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invalid question. The reality is that the two change\ntogether.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither is the cause and neither is the effect. They just\n&gt; happen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fire\nwith\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically. It may take time, but it will happen by\nitself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What do the seven &quot;tongues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
