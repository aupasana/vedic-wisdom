It is a case of an Individual running away from suffering but sin=\r\nce the karmic accounts need to be paid it will have to suffer without a bod=\r\ny .\n\nKanchi Paramcharya once explained the riddle of fate vs freewill very =\r\nbeautifully .I am attaching the link below as well as copying the matter fo=\r\nr the benefit of rest of the members.\n\nhttp://www.advaita-vedanta.org/artic=\r\nles/The_Riddle_of_Fate_and_Free.htm\n\n\nThe Riddle of Fate and Free-Will Solv=\r\ned\n\n(A dialogue between His Holiness Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati\n\nMahaswam=\r\ni and a Disciple): [His Holiness was the Sringeri Mathadhipati\n\n1912-1954.]=\r\n\n\n \n\nH.H. : I hope you are pursuing your studies in the Vedanta as usual?\n\n=\r\nD. : Though not regularly, I do make some occasional study.\n\nH.H. : In the =\r\ncourse of your studies, you may have come across many doubts.\n\nD. : Yes, on=\r\ne doubt repeatedly comes up to my mind.\n\nH.H. : What is it?\n\nD. : It is the=\r\n problem of the eternal conflict between fate and free-will.\n\nWhat are thei=\r\nr respective provinces and how can the conflict be\n\navoided?\n\nH.H. : If pre=\r\nsented in the way you have done it, the problem would baffle\n\neven the high=\r\nest of thinkers.\n\nD. : What is wrong with my presentation? I only stated th=\r\ne problem and\n\ndid not even explain how I find it to be a difficult one.\n\nH=\r\n.H. : Your difficulty arises in the very statement of the problem.\n\nD. : Ho=\r\nw?\n\nH.H. : A conflict arises only if there are two things. There can be no\n=\r\n\nconflict if there is only one thing.\n\nD. : But here there are two things, =\r\nfate and free-will.\n\nH.H. : Exacly. It is this assumption of yours that is =\r\nresponsible for your\n\nproblem.\n\nD. : It is not my assumption at all. How ca=\r\nn I ignore the fact that the\n\ntwo things exist as independent factors, whet=\r\nher I grant their\n\nexistence or not?\n\nH.H. : That is where you are wrong ag=\r\nain.\n\nD. : How?\n\nH.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you must know=\r\n that fate is\n\nnothing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum total of th=\r\ne\n\nresults of your past actions.\n\nAs God is but the dispenser of the fruits=\r\n of actions, fate,\n\nrepresenting those fruits, is not his creation but only=\r\n yours.\n\nFre-will is what you exercise when you act now.\n\nD. : Still I do n=\r\not see how they are not two distinct things.\n\nH.H. : Have it this way. Fate=\r\n is past karma; free-will is present karma.\n\nBoth are really one, that is, =\r\nkarma, though they may differ in the\n\nmatter of time. There can be no confl=\r\nict when they are really one.\n\nD. : But the difference in time is a vital d=\r\nifference which we cannot\n\npossibly overlook.\n\nH.H. : I do not want you to =\r\noverlook it, but only to study it more deeply.\n\nThe present is before you a=\r\nnd, by the exercise of free-will, you can\n\nattempt to shape it.\n\nThe past i=\r\ns past and is therefore beyond your vision and is\n\nrightly called adrishta,=\r\n the unseen. You cannot reasonably attempt\n\nto find out the relative streng=\r\nth of two things unless both of them\n\nare before you. But, by our very defi=\r\nnition, free-will, the present\n\nkarma, alone is before you and fate, the pa=\r\nst karma, is invisible.\n\nEven if you see two wrestlers right in front of yo=\r\nu, you cannot\n\ndecide about their relative strength. For, one may have weig=\r\nht, the\n\nother agility; one muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit=\r\n of\n\npractice and the other coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on\n\nb=\r\nuilding arguments on arguments to conclude that a particular\n\nwrestler will=\r\n be the winner.\n\nBut experience shows that each of these qualifications may=\r\n fail\n\nat any time or may prove to be a disqualification. The only practica=\r\nl\n\nmethod of determining their relative strength will be to make them\n\nwres=\r\ntle.\n\nWhile this is so, how do you expect to find by means of\n\narguments a =\r\nsolution to the problem of the relative value of fate\n\nand free-will when t=\r\nhe former by its very nature is unseen!\n\nD. : Is there no way then of solvi=\r\nng this problem?\n\nH.H. : There is this way. The wrestlers must fight with e=\r\nach other and prove\n\nwhich of them is the stronger.\n\nD. : In other words, t=\r\nhe problem of conflict will get solved only at the\n\nend of the conflict. Bu=\r\nt at that time the problem will have ceased to\n\nhave any practical signific=\r\nance.\n\nH.H. : Not only so, it will cease to exist.\n\nD. : That is, before th=\r\ne conflict begins, the problem is incapable of\n\nsolution; and, after the co=\r\nnflict ends, it is no longer necessary to\n\nfind a solution.\n\nH.H. : Just so=\r\n. In either case, it is profitless to embark on the enquiry\n\nas to the rela=\r\ntive stregth of fate and free-will.\n\n \n\nA Guide\n\n \n\nD. : Does Yor Holiness =\r\nthen mean to say that we must resign ourselves to\n\nfate?\n\nH.H. : Certainly =\r\nnot. On the other hand, you must devote yourself to free-\n\nwill.\n\nD. : How =\r\ncan that be?\n\nH.H. : Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exer=\r\ncise of your\n\nfree-will. By exercising your free-will in the past, you brou=\r\nght on\n\nthe resultant fate.\n\nBy exercising your free-will in the present, I=\r\n want you to wipe\n\nout your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if=\r\n you find it\n\nenjoyable.\n\nI any case. whether for acquiring more happiness =\r\nor for reducing\n\nmisery. you have to exercise your free-will in the present=\r\n.\n\nD. : But the exercise of free-will however well-directed, very often\n\nfa=\r\nils to secure the desired result, as fate steps in and nullifies\n\nthe actio=\r\nn of free-will.\n\nH.H. : You are again ignoring our definition of fate. It i=\r\ns not an\n\nextraneous and a new thing which steps in to nullify your free-wi=\r\nll.\n\nOn the other hand, it is already in yourself.\n\nD. : It may be so, but =\r\nits existence is felt only when it comes into\n\nconflict with free-will. How=\r\n can we possibly wipe out the past\n\nrecord when we do not know nor have the=\r\n means of knowing what it is?\n\nH.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced =\r\nsouls, the past certainly\n\nremains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is=\r\n very often an\n\nadvantage to us.\n\nFor, if we happen to know all the results=\r\n we have accumulated\n\nby our actions in this and our past lives, we will be=\r\n so much\n\nshocked as to give up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitig=\r\nate\n\nthem. Even in this life, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful\n\nGo=\r\nd has been pleased to bestow on us, so that we may not be burdened\n\nat any =\r\nmoment with a recollection of all that has happened in the\n\npast.\n\nSimilarl=\r\ny, the divine spark in us is ever bright with hope and\n\nmakes it possible f=\r\nor us to confidently exercise our free-will. It\n\nis not for us to belittle =\r\nthe significance of these two boons--\n\nforgetfulness of the past and hope f=\r\nor the future.\n\nD. : Our ignorance of the past may be useful in not deterri=\r\nng the exercise\n\nof the free-will, and hope may stimulate that exercise. Al=\r\nl the\n\nsame, it cannot be denied that fate very often does present a\n\nformi=\r\ndable obstacle in the way of such exercise.\n\nH.H. : It is not quite correct=\r\n to say that fate places obstacles in the way\n\nof free-will. On the other h=\r\nand, by seeming to oppose our efforts,\n\nit tells us what is the extent of f=\r\nree-will that is necessary now to\n\nbear fruit.\n\nOrdinarily for the purpose =\r\nof securing a single benefit, a\n\nparticular activity is prescribed; but we =\r\ndo not know how\n\nintensively or how repeatedly that activity has to be purs=\r\nued or\n\npesisted in.\n\nIf we do not succed at the very first attempt, we can=\r\n easily\n\ndeduce that in the past we have exercised our free-will just in th=\r\ne\n\nopposite direction, that the resultant of that past activity has\n\nfirst =\r\nto be eliminated and that our present effort must be\n\nproportionate to that=\r\n past activity.\n\nThus, the obstacle which fate seems to offer is just the g=\r\nauge\n\nby which we have to guide our present activities.\n\nH.H. : The obstacl=\r\ne is seen only after the exercise of our free-will; how\n\ncan that help us t=\r\no guide our activities at the start?\n\nH.H. : It need not guide us at the st=\r\nart. At the start, you must not be\n\nobsessed at all with the idea that ther=\r\ne will be any obstacle in\n\nyour way.\n\nStart with boundless hope and with th=\r\ne rpesumption that there\n\nis nothing in the way of your exercising the free=\r\n-will.\n\nIf you do not succeed, tell yourself then that there has been\n\nin t=\r\nhe past a counter-influence brought on by yourself by exercising\n\nyour free=\r\n-will in the other direction and, therefore, you must now\n\nexercise your fr=\r\nee-will with re-doubled vogor and persistence to\n\nachieve your object.\n\nTel=\r\nl yourself that, inasmuch as the seeming obstacle is of your\n\nown making, i=\r\nt is certainly within your competence to overcome it.\n\nIf you do not succee=\r\nd even after this renewed effort, there can\n\nbe absolutely no justification=\r\n for despair, for fate being but a\n\ncreature of your free-will can never be=\r\n stronger than your free-will.\n\nYour failure only means that your present e=\r\nxercise of free-will\n\nis not sufficient to counteract the result of the pas=\r\nt exercise of\n\nit.\n\nIn other words, there is no question of a relative prop=\r\nortion\n\nbetween fate and free-will as distinct factors in life. The relativ=\r\ne\n\nproportion is only as between the intensity of our past action and\n\nthe =\r\nintensity of our present action.\n\nD. : But even so, the relative intensity =\r\ncan be realised only at the end\n\nof our present effort in a particular dire=\r\nction.\n\nH.H. : It is always so in the case of everything which is adrishta =\r\nor\n\nunseen. Take, for example, a nail driven into a wooden pillar. When\n\nyo=\r\nu see it for the first time, you actually see, say, an inch of it\n\nprojecti=\r\nng out of the pillar. The rest of it has gone into the wood\n\nand you cannot=\r\n now see what exact length of the nail is imbedded in\n\nthe wood. That lengt=\r\nh, therefore, is unseen or adrishta, so far as\n\nyou are concerned. Beautifu=\r\nlly varnished as the pillar is, you do\n\nnot know what is the composition of=\r\n the wood in which the nail is\n\ndriven. That also is unseen or adrishta.\n\nN=\r\now, suppose you want to pull that nail out, can you tell me\n\nhow many pulls=\r\n will be necessary and how powerful each pull has to\n\nbe?\n\nD. : How can I? =\r\nThe number and the intensity of the pulls will depend\n\nupon the length whic=\r\nh has gone into the wood.\n\nH.H. : Certainly so. And the length which has go=\r\nne into the wood is not\n\narbitrary, but depended upon the number of strokes=\r\n which drove it in\n\nand the intensity of each of such strokes and the resis=\r\ntance which\n\nthe wood offered to them.\n\nD. : It is so.\n\nH.H. : The number a=\r\nnd intensity of the pulls needed to take out the nail\n\ndepend therefore upo=\r\nn the number and intensity of the strokes which\n\ndrove it in.\n\nD. : Yes.\n\nH=\r\n.H. : But the strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unseeable.\n=\r\n\nThey relate to the past and are adrishta.\n\nD. : Yes.\n\nH.H. : Do we stop fr=\r\nom pulling out the nail simply because we happen to be\n\nignorant of the len=\r\ngth of the nail in the wood or of the number and\n\nintensity of the strokes =\r\nwhich drove it in? Or, do we persist in\n\npulling it out by increasing our e=\r\nffort?\n\nD. : Certainly, as practical men we adopt the latter course.\n\nH.H. =\r\n: Adopt the same course in every effort of yours. Exert yourself as\n\nmuch a=\r\ns you can. Your will must succeed in the end.\n\n \n\nFunction of Shastras:\n\n \n=\r\n\nD. : But there certainly are many things which are impossible to attain\n\ne=\r\nven after the utmost exertion.\n\nH.H. : There you are mistaken. There is not=\r\nhing which is really\n\nunattainable. A thing, however, may be unattainable t=\r\no us at the\n\nparticular stage at which we are, or with the qualifications t=\r\nhat we\n\npossess.\n\nThe attainability or otherwise of a particular thing is t=\r\nhus\n\nnot an absolute characteristic of that thing but is relative and\n\nprop=\r\nortionate to our capacity to attain it.\n\nD. : The success or failure of an =\r\neffort can be known definitely only at\n\nthe end. How are we then to know be=\r\nforehand whether with our\n\npresent capacity we may or may not exert ourselv=\r\nes to attain a\n\nparticular object, and whether it is the right kind of exer=\r\ntion for\n\nthe attainment of that object?\n\nH.H. : Your question is certainly=\r\n a pertinent one. The whole aim of our\n\nDharma Shastras is to give a detail=\r\ned answer to your question.\n\nReligion does not fetter man&#39;s free-will. It l=\r\neaves him quite\n\nfree to act, but tells him at the same time what is good f=\r\nor him and\n\nwhat is not.\n\nThe resposibility is entirely and solely his. He =\r\ncannot escape it by\n\nblaming fate, for fate is of his own making, nor by bl=\r\naming God, for\n\nhe is but the dispenser of fruits in accordance with the me=\r\nrits of\n\nactions. You are the master of your own destiny. It is for you to\n=\r\n\nmake it, to better it or to mar it. This is your privilege. This is\n\nyour =\r\nresponsibility.\n\nD. : I quite realise this. But often it so happens that I =\r\nam not really\n\nmaster of myself. I know, for instance, quite well that a pa=\r\nrticular\n\nact is wrong; at the same time, I feel impelled to do it. Similar=\r\nly,\n\nI know that another act is right; at the same time, however, I feel\n\np=\r\nowerless to do it. It seems that there is some power which is able\n\nto cont=\r\nrol or defy my free-will. So long as that power is potent,\n\nhow can I be ca=\r\nlled the master of my own destiny? Whatis that power\n\nbut fate?\n\nH.H. : You=\r\n are evidently confusing together two distinct things. Fate is a\n\nthing qui=\r\nte different from the other one which you call a power.\n\nSuppose you handle=\r\n an instrument for the first time. You will do it\n\nvery clumsily and with g=\r\nreat effort.\n\nThe next time, however, you use it, you will do so less\n\nclum=\r\nsily and with less effort. With repeated uses, you will have\n\nlearnt to use=\r\n it easily and without any effort. That is, the facility\n\nand ease with whi=\r\nch you use a particular thing increase with the\n\nnumber of times you use it=\r\n.\n\nThe first time a man steals, he does so with great effort and\n\nmuch fear=\r\n; the next time both his effort and fear are much less. As\n\nopportunities i=\r\nncrease, stealing will become a normal habit with him\n\nand will require no =\r\neffort at all. This habit will generate in him a\n\ntendency to steal even wh=\r\nen there is no necessity to steal. It is\n\nthis tendency which goes by the n=\r\name vasana. The power which makes\n\nyou act as if against your will is only =\r\nthe vasana which itself is of\n\nyour own making. This is not fate.\n\nThe puni=\r\nshment or reward, in the shape of pain or pleasure,\n\nwhich is the inevitabl=\r\ne consequence of an act, good or bad, is alone\n\nthe province of fate or des=\r\ntiny.\n\nThe vasana which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind\n\nin t=\r\nhe shape of a taste, a greater facility or a greater tendency for\n\ndoing th=\r\ne same act once again, is quite a different thing. It may be\n\nthat the puni=\r\nshment or the reward of the past act is, in ordinary\n\ncircumstances, unavoi=\r\ndable, if there is no counter-effort; but the\n\nvasana can be easily handled=\r\n if only we exercise our free-will\n\ncorrectly.\n\nD. : But the number of vasa=\r\nnas or tendencies that rule our hearts are\n\nendless. How can we possibly co=\r\nntrol them?\n\nH.H. : The essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression =\r\nin outward\n\nacts. This characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and ba=\r\nd.\n\nThe stream of vasanas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two\n\ncurr=\r\nents, the good and the bad.\n\nIf you try to dam up the entire stream, there =\r\nmey be danger.\n\nThe Shastras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On=\r\n the\n\nother hand, they ask you to submit yourself to be led by the good\n\nva=\r\nsana current and to resist being led away by the bad vasana\n\ncurrent.\n\nWhen=\r\n you know that a particular vasana is rising up in your\n\nmind, you cannot p=\r\nossibly say that you are at its mercy. You have\n\nyour wits about you and th=\r\ne responsibility of deciding whether you\n\nwill encourage it or not is entir=\r\nely yours.\n\nThe Shastras ennciate in detail what vasanas are good and\n\nhave=\r\n to be encouraged and what vasanas are bad and have to be\n\novercome.\n\n&gt;When=\r\n, by dint of practice, you have made all your vasanas\n\ngood and practically=\r\n eliminated the charge of any bad vasanas\n\nleading you astray, the Shastras=\r\n take upon themselves the function\n\nof teaching you how to free your free-w=\r\nill even from the need of\n\nbeing led by good vasanas.\n\nYou will gradually b=\r\ne led on to a stage when your free-will\n\nbe entirely free from any sort of =\r\ncoloring due to any vasanas.\n\nAt that stage, your mind will be pure as crys=\r\ntal and all\n\nmotive for particular action will cease to be. Freedom from th=\r\ne\n\nresults of particular actions is an inevitable consequence. Both\n\nfate a=\r\nnd vasana disappear. There is freedom for ever more and that\n\nfreedom is ca=\r\nlled Moksha.\n\n_____________________________________________________________=\r\n_______________\n\n \n\n.. shrii shaN^karaarpaNamastu ..\n\n \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, Murahari Vadapalli &lt;murahariv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste N=\r\narasimha, \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Prarabdha karma is considered as fate or destiny.

But you can either do it with an attached and agitated mind or a ca=\r\nlm mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; People in the examples I mentioned above engaged in what may =\r\nseem like material actions, but they did them after overcoming attachments =\r\nand with an equanimous mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I keep saying, what you do is a second=\r\nary factor and how you do it is primary. Even as we engage in actions that =\r\nwe believe to be our dharma, we should work on our attitude and increase su=\r\nrrender. When one has surrendered to god and is able to look at pleasure an=\r\nd pain, praise and censure in the same way, then one&#39;s dharma will be far c=\r\nlearer to one. One whose mind is densely conditioned by duality and desires=\r\n will see one&#39;s dharma through the coloring of that conditioning and may mi=\r\nsjudge. On the other hand, one with a clear mind with very little condition=\r\ning will see one&#39;s dharma clearer.\n&gt; \n&gt; In simpler words, one who heavily i=\r\ndentifies with the body and wants comforts and pleasures of the body will s=\r\nee one&#39;s dharma from that motivation. One may identify with body, with a gr=\r\noup of people, with a deity etc. As is the identification, so is the condit=\r\nioning and so is one&#39;s vision of one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though everyone is play=\r\ning their allotted role, some have densely conditioned minds and unable to =\r\nsee their dharma clearly and pursuing adharma. As a result, they may contin=\r\nue to be allotted roles where densely conditioned minds restrict their acti=\r\nons, in future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some have very clear minds and able to see their dharm=\r\na clearly and pursuing higher dharma. As a result, they may continue to all=\r\notted roles where lighter and lighter mental conditioning restricts them an=\r\nd eventually they become free.\n&gt; \n&gt; One can try to use free will to move fr=\r\nom the former case to the latter case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Films that make a difference: http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org\n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Raj Nambisan &lt;rajnambisan@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; i have a question: if everyone is playing the allotted role, =\r\nas the peerless maharshi alludes to, then what&#39;s the point in our debating =\r\nthese things? \n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t the thesis apply to osama, nehru, ga=\r\nndhiji equally -- that is, each one is/was playing the exact role he is/was=\r\n supposed to, right or wrong?\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; which begs the question, when =\r\ndoes free will begin and fate end?\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; enlightenment, please..\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; raj\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarsh=\r\ni14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear KK,\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Great question!\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Also, I personally do not agree that a saint cannot interfere in the polit=\r\nical situation of a country.
