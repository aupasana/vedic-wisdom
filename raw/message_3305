Faith is needed in religion, but corruptions do take place and it is us=\r\neful to question. Blind faith in some things is useful to make progress, bu=\r\nt one cannot place blind faith in everything attributed to a religion and s=\r\nhun logic completely. Truth is arrived at by a combination of reason and fa=\r\nith. Without faith, only reason cannot take one to the highest truths. With=\r\nout reason, blind faith cannot take one to the highest truths, especially i=\r\nf one starts off with faith in wrong notions (e.g. one may believe that you=\r\n reach god if you kill people not belonging to one&#39;s religion).\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Fortunate is one who finds the right balance between faith and reason, use=\r\ns reason to find the right notions to place faith in and makes quick progre=\r\nss.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (1) In practical physical terms, cow milk is a simple and nutritious food =\r\nwith plenty of poteins and easy to digest. It is very saattwik and has many=\r\n useful properties as per ayurveda.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; However, if you replace cow=\r\ns that live a relaxed lifestyle feeding in open grasslands on grass and lea=\r\nves with cows that live a hectic and stressful lifestyle in congested facto=\r\nries feeding on chicken etc, the gunas of milk are considerably different. =\r\nIt&#39;s not the same anymore.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; A cow can produce more milk than wha=\r\nt is needed by its calf. People in the old days never deprived calves of mo=\r\nther&#39;s milk and took milk after the calf was fed. Instead, if one deprives =\r\nthe calf and steals all the milk (like many factories may be doing), that k=\r\narma will follow the milk and go to various people handling, using and cons=\r\numing that milk, in different proportions.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; (2) Yes, a cloth mad=\r\ne of silk carries a lot of negative karma. Putting so many worms in boiling=\r\n water and killing them is negative karma. I feel far more comfortable putt=\r\ning in homam fire a cotton cloth made from a tree than putting a silk cloth=\r\n made by killing many worms. Though silk clothes are fashionable in religio=\r\nus ceremonies now, one cannot be sure whether this was a custom in ancient =\r\ntimes or the current silk is a substitute for another kind of cloth made no=\r\nn-violently in ancient times.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; When people cannot find something=\r\n that is used traditionally, they try to find a substitute to feel good tha=\r\nt they are following the customs. If they do not clearly understand the mot=\r\nivation/rationale/spirit behind a custom, they may end up with a bad substi=\r\ntute. For example, I have seen people decorating idols with nice looking pl=\r\nastic flowers and plastic flower garlands. Plastic is a really bad substitu=\r\nte for a real flower. People only use them for decorating idols and do not =\r\nput them in homam fire, but who knows, people may start offering plastic fl=\r\nowers in homam fire after a few hundred years.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Like that, silk =\r\nclothes may have come into usage as a bad substitute for something else.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; (3) Supreme god understands everything.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; The purpose o=\r\nf a mantra is not for requesting god for a specific thing. The purpose of a=\r\n mantra is to stabilize an overactive mind and focus it on something. Mind =\r\nis like a monkey jumping up and down and running here and there. Mantra is =\r\nlike a rope that ties it to a fixed pole (a deity or a focus point). As one=\r\n tries to focus the mind on a deity/mantra and give up all other thoughts, =\r\na moment will come (perhaps after minutes of sadhana or hours or days or ye=\r\nars or lives) when mind will let all other thoughts go. Mind will then reve=\r\nrberate with the mantra, with no other thoughts in it whatsoever. One forge=\r\nts oneself completely and gets absorbed in the mantra *fully*. That is when=\r\n one *experiences* a mantra and a deity.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Such a thing is possib=\r\nle with any combination of sounds. One can repeat &quot;I bow to the holy father=\r\n&quot; for ever and reach such a state.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; However, depending on the ma=\r\nntra being repeated in the mind and the deity being focused on, the experie=\r\nnce of the mind when the mantra fills the mind and all other thoughts cease=\r\n will be different. Different mantras will give different experiences. Vari=\r\nous deities, their Sanskrit mantras and beejas were experimented by many gr=\r\neat yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. If you want to tie a m=\r\nonkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope was tested before, it=\r\n may be good to use that rope.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Secondly, arrangement of sounds =\r\nin Sanskrit alphabet has a deep significance and correlation to the subtle =\r\nbody. Different sounds are vibrating in different parts of the subtle body.=\r\n Sanskrit alphabet and mantras are constructed beautifully. When one&#39;s self=\r\n-awareness ascends from the regular plane of consciousness, one can experie=\r\nnce other realms of consciousness that are vibrating with different sounds.=\r\n Sanskrit captures that well.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Thirdly, each tangible article (s=\r\nuch as a book or an email or a mantra) has some remnants of the energy of p=\r\nersons who associated with it. When I say a specific combination of words, =\r\nit may have one impact on you. When a saint says the same combination of wo=\r\nrds with the same tone, it may have another impact on you. A sentence one w=\r\nrites when one is in a bad mood or bad spiritual state may not have any imp=\r\nact on readers. A sentence one writes in a very good state of mind after a =\r\nlot of sadhana and control over mind may inspire readers more\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhat is because one&#39;s shakti works through one&#39;s words and other tangible ac=\r\ntions. For this reason, mantras that were composed by great yogis or used b=\r\ny great yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some of th=\r\neir shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of tha=\r\nt shakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras compose=\r\nd by great souls like Adi Shankara.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; So it is a good idea to use=\r\n well-known Sanskrit mantras that were used by generations of great saints =\r\nand yogis.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =A0 Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Films=\r\n that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; =A0 Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 12/17/=\r\n09, ramypras &lt;ramypras@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; From: ramypras &lt;ramypras@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Basic queries\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date=\r\n: Thursday, December 17, 2009, 12:02 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n      Namaskara!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have some very basic questions and wa=\r\ns not convinced by answers that are usually given.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Ho=\r\nw can milk be considered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely being a=\r\nnd is worshiped as `Kamadenu&#39;. But in actual sense we are extracting milk a=\r\nnd preventing the calf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin to=\r\n stop a young calf from having milk from its mother?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. =\r\nHow can silk cloth be considered sacred for worship? Silk is obtained by ki=\r\nlling thousand&#39;s of cocoon. Using a product which is obtained by killing so=\r\n many living beings and we being a cause for such an action...Are we not do=\r\ning sin?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. I tell my daily prayers but I have not learn=\r\nt Sanskrit and don&#39;t understand the meaning of many prayers that I say ever=\r\nyday. Why is it necessary to say the slokas in Sanskrit and not other langu=\r\nage??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Will our Supreme Lord not understand other languages ?? or i=\r\ns it just bcos Sanskrit has been used from the very early times it is still=\r\n in practice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~Ramya\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
