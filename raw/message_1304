Please see below.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is interesting that she considers Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa as \n&gt; her guru. It \n&gt; &gt; is interesting that Ramakrishna t=\r\nold her she had to &quot;do fire \n&gt; ceremonies and \n&gt; &gt; show what is truth&quot; and =\r\n&quot;at that time the whole world will be \n&gt; peace&quot;. This \n&gt; &gt; is similar to wh=\r\nat my guru was told by Divine Mother when she \n&gt; appeared to \n&gt; &gt; him durin=\r\ng Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She told him that many people are=\r\n and will be born who will \n&gt; perform a short \n&gt; &gt; fire ritual on a regular=\r\n basis, establish sanatana dharma and \n&gt; peace in the \n&gt; &gt; world and also m=\r\nake quick spiritual progress individually in that \n&gt; process. \n&gt; &gt; Shree Ma=\r\na&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along \n&gt; similar \n&gt; &gt; line=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular \n=\r\n&gt; Chandi homam \n&gt; &gt; should be established around the world, where Chandi ho=\r\nmam is \ndone \n&gt; 3 times a \n&gt; &gt; day. These places do not need to be near any=\r\n temples or famous \n&gt; places and \n&gt; &gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not =\r\nbe elaborate. For example, \n&gt; there is no \n&gt; &gt; need to offer silk sarees et=\r\nc in fire. A simple ritual with bare \n&gt; minimum \n&gt; &gt; offerings is enough, b=\r\nut it needs to be performed 3 times \n&gt; everyday. When a \n&gt; &gt; few such centr=\r\nes are established, it will apparently lead to a \n&gt; chain of \n&gt; &gt; events th=\r\nat will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though not 3 times a da=\r\ny, these people have done a Chandi homam \n&gt; everyday for \n&gt; &gt; 3 years in th=\r\ne same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is \n&gt; fantastic! \n&gt; &gt; It is=\r\n the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and \n&gt; brings \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndeities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any \n&gt; divine=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; presence these days, new places of divine presence may be created \n&gt; =\r\nby pure \n&gt; &gt; souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in t=\r\nhe \n&gt; world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Cha=\r\nndi homam \n&gt; during which \n&gt; &gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my =\r\nguru on spreading \n&gt; homam was \n&gt; &gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversa=\r\nry and the time of sankalpa \n&gt; was within \n&gt; &gt; a few minutes from the actua=\r\nl Tithi Pravesha time of the birth \n&gt; anniversary. \n&gt; &gt; All of this was a c=\r\noincidence and we were unaware of this \n&gt; significance when \n&gt; &gt; we decided=\r\n the muhurta. It is interesting to know that \nRamakrishna \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; menti=\r\non fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his \n&gt; words are \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsimilar to the words of Mother.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is=\r\n the very interesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pasted for your=\r\n benefit), from an interview found here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa .org/drup=\r\nal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, m=\r\ny Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go \n&gt; now for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our country, and all =\r\nother country, you have to go do fire \n&gt; ceremonies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and show what is =\r\ntruth, what is dignity, and at that time the \n&gt; whole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world will be p=\r\neace.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Sara=\r\nswati (of American \n&gt; descent),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that same page describes his backgrou=\r\nnd, how he met her and all \n&gt; that;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but another interesting snippet i=\r\nn there:-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle A=\r\nsia was arduous \nat \n&gt; best,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to Indi=\r\na&#39;s interior where he \n&gt; studied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a number of gurus, coming to em=\r\nbrace the worship of Chandi \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagy=\r\na, as his primary system of \n&gt; worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and meditation, while undertak=\r\ning great austerities in the \n&gt; process.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;They undertoo=\r\nk the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire \n&gt; ceremony\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and worship=\r\n of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; humble temple=\r\n grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!

This &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nis similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; appe=\r\nared to &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; She told him that many people are and will be born who wil=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; perform a short &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fire ritual on a regular basis, es=\r\ntablish sanatana dharma and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; peace in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world and a=\r\nlso make quick spiritual progress individually in that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; process. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; similar &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lines.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My guru wa=\r\ns also told by Mother that a few centres of regular &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Chandi homam &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;done &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3 times a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; day. These places do not need to =\r\nbe near any temples or famous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; places and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can be anyw=\r\nhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there is no &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with ba=\r\nre\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; minimum &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; offerings is enough, but it needs to be =\r\nperformed 3 times &lt;BR&gt;&gt; everyday. When a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; few such centres =\r\nare established, it will apparently lead to a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; chain of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; everyday for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3 years in the same place and finished 1000=\r\n such homas. That is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fantastic! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is the sadhana an=\r\nd purity of sadhakas that creates energy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; brings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ndeities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ndivine &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; presence these days, new places of divine presence may=\r\n be created &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; souls engaged in selfless sadhan=\r\na for establishing dharma in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; d=\r\nuring which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru =\r\non spreading &lt;BR&gt;&gt; homam was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth=\r\n anniversary and the time of sankalpa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was within &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a f=\r\new minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; annive=\r\nrsary. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of t=\r\nhis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; significance when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; we decided the muhurta. It is =\r\ninteresting to know that &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mention=\r\n fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; words are &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; similar to the words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Do Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicast=\r\nro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. hom=\r\ne.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; She co=\r\nnsiders Shri Ramakrishna as her&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Master, has a small ashra=\r\nm here near\n the Bay Area&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is t=\r\nhe very interesting part (snippets from her website&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; paste=\r\nd for your benefit), from an interview found here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonomy_menu/54/86&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ra=\r\nmakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go &lt;BR&gt;&gt; now for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; our country, and all other country, you have to go do fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; ceremonies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and=\r\n at that time the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; whole&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world will be peace.&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Her main =\r\ndisciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American &lt;BR&gt;&gt; descent),&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her and a=\r\nll &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n that;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but another interesting snippet in the=\r\nre:-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At a time when journ=\r\neying throughout Middle Asia was arduous &lt;BR&gt;at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; best,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; studied&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the w=\r\norship of Chandi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the sacred fire ceremony, t=\r\nhe yagya, as his primary system of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; worship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and m=\r\neditation, while undertaking great austerities in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; process.&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra =\r\nChandi Yagya, a three year fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ceremony&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and wor=\r\nship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from &lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; humble temple grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--6--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Add mo=\r\nre friends to your messenger and enjoy! &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/t=\r\nagline_messenger_6/*http://messenger.yahoo.com/invite/&quot;&gt; Invite them now.&lt;/=\r\na&gt;\r\n--0-996895581-1235538192=:96329--\r\n\n"}}
