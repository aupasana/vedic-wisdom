He\nsaid that\n\n(1) Brahman is real,\n(2) the universe is unr=\r\neal, and\n(3) The universe is Brahman.\n\nHe did not stop at the second, becau=\r\nse the third explains the other two. It\nsignifies that the universe is real=\r\n if perceived as the Self, and unreal if\nperceived apart from the Self. Hen=\r\nce maya and reality are one and the same.\n\nQ: So the world is not really il=\r\nlusory?\n\nA: At the level of the spiritual seeker you have got to say that t=\r\nhe world\nis an illusion. There is no other way. When a man forgets that he =\r\nis\nBrahman, who is real, permanent and omnipresent, and deludes himself int=\r\no\nthinking that he is a body in the universe which is filled with bodies th=\r\nat\nare transitory, and labours under that delusion, you have got to remind =\r\nhim\nthat the world is unreal and a delusion. Why?\n\nBecause his vision which=\r\n has forgotten its own Self is dwelling in the\nexternal, material universe.=\r\n It will not turn inwards into introspection\nunless you impress on him that=\r\n all this external, material universe is\nunreal. When once he realizes his =\r\nown Self he will know that there is\nnothing other than his own Self and he =\r\nwill come to look upon the whole\nuniverse as Brahman. There is no universe =\r\nwithout the Self.\n\nSo long as a man does not see the Self which is the orig=\r\nin of all, but looks\nonly at the external world as real and permanent, you =\r\nhave to tell him that\nall this external universe is an illusion. You cannot=\r\n help it.\n\nTake a paper. We see only the script, and nobody notices the pap=\r\ner on which\nthe script is written. The paper is there whether the script on=\r\n it is there\nor not.To those who look upon the script as real, you have to =\r\nsay that it is\nunreal, an illusion, since it rests upon the paper. The wise=\r\n man looks upon\nboth the Paper and script as one. So also with Brahman and =\r\nthe universe.\n\nQ: So the world is real when it is experienced as the Self a=\r\nnd unreal when\nit is seen as separate names and forms?\n\nA:Just as fire is o=\r\nbscured by smoke, the shining light of consciousness is\nobscured by the ass=\r\nemblage of names and forms,the world. When by\ncompassionate divine grace th=\r\ne mind becomes clear, the nature of the world\nwill be known to be not the i=\r\nllusory forms but only the reality.\n\nOnly those people whose minds are devo=\r\nid of the evil power of maya, having\ngiven up the knowledge of the world an=\r\nd being unattached to it, and having\nthereby attained the knowledge of the =\r\nself-shining supreme reality, can\ncorrectly know the meaning of the stateme=\r\nnt `The world is real.&#39; If one&#39;s\noutlook has been transformed to the nature=\r\n of real knowledge, the world of\nthe five elements beginning with ether [ak=\r\nasa] will be real, being the\nsupreme reality,which is the nature of knowled=\r\nge.\n\nThe original state of this empty world,which is bewildering and crowde=\r\nd with\nmany names and forms, is bliss, which is one, just as the egg-yolk o=\r\nf a\nmulti-coloured peacock is only one. Know this truth by abiding in the s=\r\ntate\nof Self.\n\nSource: from Creation theories and the reality of the world =\r\nchapter, from Be\nAs You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi,edited by=\r\n David Godman\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=\r\n=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e659fc22f83f57048a1232c8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nQ: Sri Bhagavan often says that maya [illusion] and reality are =\r\nthe same.
