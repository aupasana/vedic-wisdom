I have already implemented som=\r\ne of the recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam Tva=\r\n Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot; from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! \n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians spe=\r\nak Hindi, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, =\r\n&quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit=\r\n that a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel=\r\n. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They ca=\r\nrry that habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the N=\r\north Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bh=\r\naja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, =\r\nwhich sounded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages lik=\r\ne Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manas=\r\na&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadh=\r\ni also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that,=\r\n that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana Sar=\r\noja\n&gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Guruch=\r\naran saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on this aspect as well. \n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRe: Common Sanskrit Pronunciation Errors (Part 1)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just igno=\r\nre this idiot!&quot;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear narasimha guruji \n&gt; \n&gt; you are doing a great job=\r\n to this universe by sharing your knwledge\n&gt; and correcting,but you are too=\r\nooo humble!!!.Truth ia truth and what ever you are saying is also truth .no=\r\n need to consider yourself as an idiot\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once said that even Vedas are corrupted these day=\r\ns. It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my f=\r\neeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scholars, pronounce=\r\n some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the sp=\r\nirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation is =\r\na factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Veda m=\r\nantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most com=\r\nplete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can me=\r\nmorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; =\r\na mantra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on corre=\r\nct pronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that=\r\n correct pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment o=\r\nf the errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ign=\r\nore my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to chan=\r\nging your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt =\r\nmy suggestions if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take t=\r\nhe &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, =\r\n&quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrect=\r\nly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There=\r\n is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption=\r\n nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/s=\r\nyllable/akshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowe=\r\nl sound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of a=\r\nksharas, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still e=\r\nxperience something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never exper=\r\nience the mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Akshara m=\r\neans &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshar=\r\na. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no pr=\r\naana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pro=\r\nnounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the =\r\nsound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has =\r\nno life force.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one ak=\r\nshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara =\r\n&quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that aks=\r\nhara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pro=\r\nnounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure =\r\nwhether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens =\r\ncarefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and =\r\nabrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; This makes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or =\r\nsome other vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana=\r\n and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhand=\r\nas changes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; =\r\nas &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to he=\r\nar, so that his students would not get confused when learning. Probably the=\r\n students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used t=\r\no that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standard practice after a=\r\n couple of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, yo=\r\nu do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a co=\r\nnsonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at t=\r\nhe end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to all consonants=\r\n and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. There can be wo=\r\nrds that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normally add an art=\r\nificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas and alterin=\r\ng the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).=\r\n Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In T=\r\nelugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar an=\r\nd just one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that some people =\r\nstarted mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot=\r\n and others started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream=\r\n and one pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanskri=\r\nt is not English. We never have two different symbols for the same sound or=\r\n two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are =\r\ndifferent and their sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =\r\n=3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as i=\r\nn &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people =\r\nsay &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This =\r\nmeans &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharm=\r\na (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) a=\r\nnd moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaa=\r\nrtha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma,=\r\n kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purusha=\r\nardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mi=\r\nstake and I have seen it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the diff=\r\nerence between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. Whe=\r\nn you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that =\r\nyou are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are severa=\r\nl other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pronuncia=\r\ntion of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next fe=\r\nw months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please give me your co=\r\nnsideration and take my input into consideration in altering your pronuncia=\r\ntion (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I am sa=\r\nying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand that. I =\r\nam not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She inspired =\r\nme to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are SOME w=\r\nho are destined to change their pronunciation based on my views. That is wh=\r\ny I am writing these mails.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you do not like this discussion, I =\r\nam sorry and just ignore this idiot!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do Ganapa=\r\nthi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): =\r\nhttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-192195998-1302346894=:43832\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Sri Utpalji, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;I have gone thru this and my observations are exactly like Shri Narasimh=\r\na&#39;s!

I have already implemented some of the recommendati=\r\nons you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam Tva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot; =\r\nfrom your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n In the recent\n times I was pondering about how north Indians speak Hindi, =\r\nwhere they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Kr=\r\nishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a co=\r\nnsonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel. But for =\r\nwhatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that h=\r\nabit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the North India=\r\nn bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govind=\r\nam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which soun=\r\nded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bha=\r\nsha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more=\r\n important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also wit=\r\nhout proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that appr=\r\noach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana Saroja&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; raja&quot;\n should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Guruchara=\r\nn saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on this aspect as well. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nagraj &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswi=\r\nnefy2003@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: aswinefy2003 &lt;as=\r\nwinefy2003@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Common Sanskrit Pron=\r\nunciation Errors (Part 1)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo=\r\n.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot=\r\n!&quot;&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear narasimha guruji &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you are doing =\r\na great job to this universe by sharing your knwledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and correctin=\r\ng,but you are tooooo\n humble!!!.Truth ia truth and what ever you are saying=\r\n is also truth .no need to consider yourself as an idiot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -=\r\n-- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdo=\r\nm%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic=\r\n-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V=\r\n.R.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everythin=\r\ng.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, including =\r\nhighly learned Vedic scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (i=\r\nncluding Veda mantras) incorrectly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, p=\r\nronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the spirit of surrender=\r\n to god is even more important. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Esp=\r\necially, correct\n pronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pr=\r\nonunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most complete experience=\r\n of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can memorize and repea=\r\nt Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on cor=\r\nrect pronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think th=\r\nat correct pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment=\r\n of the errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please i=\r\ngnore my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to ch=\r\nanging your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adop=\r\nt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words =\r\nlike &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and s=\r\ncholars\n pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something lik=\r\ne &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corruption cam=\r\ne into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. I=\r\nf you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end=\r\n, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes t=\r\nhe chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience somethin=\r\ng when meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra t=\r\no the fullest with that pronunciation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Akshara m=\r\neans &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshar=\r\na. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no pr=\r\naana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pro=\r\nnounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the\n=\r\n sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has=\r\n no life force.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sou=\r\nnd &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply jo=\r\nins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becom=\r\nes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one =\r\nguru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listene=\r\nr to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possi=\r\nble if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end i=\r\ns a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to he=\r\nar clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This makes people add some vowel to =\r\nit (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them=\r\n) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It sudde=\r\nnly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that =\r\n&quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his stu=\r\ndents would not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought t=\r\nhe mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunci=\r\nation. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centurie=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you=\r\n do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a con=\r\nsonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at th=\r\ne end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in c=\r\nonsonants applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more co=\r\nmmonly encountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. The=\r\nre also, people normally add an artificial vowel sound\n at the end and end =\r\nup changing the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. Tha=\r\nt is also wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Mo=\r\nst south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telu=\r\ngu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and j=\r\nust one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that some people sta=\r\nrted mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot an=\r\nd others started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream an=\r\nd one pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for th=\r\ne same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot;=\r\n and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; =\r\n(as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a\n stress/aspiration to=\r\n get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the san=\r\nkalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha =\r\npurushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (pur=\r\nposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and mon=\r\ney), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most p=\r\neople end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama m=\r\noksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; mea=\r\nns &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronuncia=\r\ntion in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many=\r\n many trained priests!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taa=\r\nntrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and=\r\n &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot;=\r\n in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure\n that you are not confusing t=\r\nha for dha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The=\r\nre are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in =\r\nthe pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly i=\r\nn the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into considera=\r\ntion in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t=\r\n find any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by your g=\r\nurus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciat=\r\nion. But, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am=\r\n guessing that there are SOME who are destined to change their pronunciatio=\r\nn based on my views.
