All the things you loved, all the thin=\r\ngs you claimed to be yours, I take them and tear everything apart. I burn y=\r\nour IIIT degree in front of you, and leave no trace of your very claim to b=\r\ne from IIIT.\n\nI take your real estate papers and feed it to the dogs.\n\nAnd =\r\nthen lets say I take your arm in my hand , and cut it off. And then I take =\r\nthe other and I cut it off. Then I take the blood that is pouring out and D=\r\nrink it, while you are still alive. And then I grab the back of your head a=\r\nnd slash it off. \n\nAnd this all happens on one fine Sunday morning without =\r\nwarning.\n\nMr. Tripathi, I abolish all that is &quot;Gaurav Tripathi&quot; in your lif=\r\ne, and make you realize who you truly are and merge your tiny blob of light=\r\n into the infinite light that is me, and I&#39;ll do it in the manner described=\r\n above, are you willing to love me??\nAre you willing to call me in your hom=\r\ne??\nAre you willing to wash my feet and drink the water??\n\nYour eyes percei=\r\nve that I have slashed your arms off, but in reality I have taken your karm=\r\nas off, isn&#39;t that the best thing?\n\nYour eyes perceive that I have destroye=\r\nd everything that you ever had, but what did you bring in the world when yo=\r\nu were born?? Thus, by apparently destroying what you claim to be yours, ha=\r\nven&#39;t I broken an illusion of yours??\n\nYour eyes perceive your death, but i=\r\nn reality i am just taking my baby back whom i love.\n\nThe more attached you=\r\n are to the false notion of &quot;you&quot;, the more fierce she appears. But if afte=\r\nr doing strenuous penance, you realize that &quot;oh my gawd, all my life I have=\r\n been identifying with this and that, and that and this.&quot;, then she will ap=\r\npear to be the most loveliest being out there. Easy to type and easy to rea=\r\nd, difficult to be at this stage.\n\nWho says you are to fear your own mother=\r\n? If you truly surrender to your mother then she can do anything with your =\r\nexistence, right? After all she is your mother. \n\nThis is why they say be c=\r\nareful while saying I surrender and do anything god but I only want you. Be=\r\n prepared then to do &quot;anything&quot;.\n\nAnyways keep on doing penance, its the on=\r\nly purpose of this birth.\n\nJai girnari!!!\n\nWarm Regards,\nNobody\n\n--- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, gaurav tripathi &lt;gaurav_alld@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dea=\r\nr PVR =C3=82=C2=A0Sir,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0Thank =C3=82=C2=A0you for=\r\n =C3=82=C2=A0clearing my =C3=82=C2=A0doubts.=C3=82=C2=A0After=C3=82=C2=A0 r=\r\neading your explanation some more =C3=82=C2=A0questions have =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0erupted\n&gt; in =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0 mind.

One may accept whatever mate=\r\nrial results god gives, but be prepared for any results and take what god g=\r\nives as mahaprasad. Sure, some people have gotten great material results fr=\r\nom homam, but there are no guarantees.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; If you have a dharm=\r\nik material result in mind (e.g. marriage, childbirth, getting a job etc), =\r\nit is ok to think of it, but do not get into the frame of mind that homam w=\r\nill solve your problem. Use homam as a way to reach god and then let god de=\r\ncide what is right for you. Accept that what you currently want may or may =\r\nnot be the best for you.

Her slaying o=\r\nf Mahisha, Nishumbha, Shumbha etc symbolize slaying one&#39;s pride (over one&#39;s=\r\n achievements), one&#39;s mamata or mine-ness (looking at things, including bod=\r\ny, as &quot;mine&quot;), one&#39;s asmita or I-am-ness (the very notion that one exists a=\r\ns a being separate from Brahman) etc. As anyone trying to overcome those wi=\r\nll know, it is not an easy task at all. Chandi represents a very fierce app=\r\nroach to it, which simply destroys those (and puts one in samadhi!). In sad=\r\nhana and rituals, we use symbols and eventually external symbols resonate w=\r\nith internal happenings.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; For most people, Chandi is too fi=\r\nerce. Though phalasruti entices with all kinds of nice results (which is th=\r\ne case with most prayers in Hinduism!), please note that Chandi is not for =\r\neveryone.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Especially so with Chandi homam. Fire amplifies =\r\nthings and the energy of the prayer resonates in the internal fire faster. =\r\nI humbly suggest that people should not rush into Chandi homam. Not that it=\r\n produces bad results. It may produce supreme results, but you may not be l=\r\nooking for those or be ready for them!\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; It is better to do =\r\nChandipath for a few weeks or months, before trying Chandi homam.\n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Also, don&#39;t think that=\r\n Chandi homam is the only homam for fast progress. Most higher deities (Kri=\r\nshna, Vishnu, Shiva, Lakshmi, Hanuman etc) are capable of giving all materi=\r\nal and spiritual results one may imagine.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; If you can find =\r\na deity whose homam generates love and feeling inside your heart, THAT homa=\r\nm is the right homam for you.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; In fact, even Ganapathi homa=\r\nm is capable of giving everything. Because we worship Ganapathi in the begi=\r\nnning of every homam, people look at Ganapathi homam as an &quot;appetizer&quot; and =\r\nChandi homam etc as the &quot;full meal&quot;. That&#39;s not correct. Even Ganapathi hom=\r\nam can be a &quot;full meal&quot;. What makes a homam complete is the love, surrender=\r\n and feeling for the deity in your heart.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; On Mon, May 7, 2012 at 2:10 PM, g=\r\naurav tripathi wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 Dear=C3=82=C2=A0 All , =\r\n\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 Namste..!!!=C3=82=C2=A0 After=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0 a long=C3=82=C2=A0 thinking i=C3=82=C2=A0 decided=C3=82=C2=A0 to=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 do=C3=82=C2=A0 the=C3=82=C2=A0 Chandi=C3=82=C2=A0 Homam.

Her slaying of Mahisha, Nishumbha, Shu=\r\nmbha etc symbolize slaying one&#39;s pride (over one&#39;s achievements), one&#39;s mam=\r\nata or mine-ness (looking at things, including body, as &quot;mine&quot;), one&#39;s asmi=\r\nta or I-am-ness (the very notion that one exists as a being separate from B=\r\nrahman) etc. As anyone trying to overcome those will know, it is not an eas=\r\ny task at all. Chandi represents a very fierce approach to it, which simply=\r\n destroys those (and puts one in samadhi!). In sadhana and rituals, we use =\r\nsymbols and eventually external symbols resonate with internal happenings.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For most people, Chandi is too fierce. Thoug=\r\nh phalasruti entices with all kinds of nice results (which is the case with=\r\n most prayers in Hinduism!), please note that Chandi is not for everyone.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Especially so with Chandi homam. Fire amplifi=\r\nes things and the energy of the prayer resonates in the internal fire faste=\r\nr. I humbly suggest that people should not rush into Chandi homam. Not that=\r\n it produces bad results. It may produce supreme results, but you may not b=\r\ne looking for those or be ready for them!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It=\r\n is better to do Chandipath for a few weeks or months, before trying Chandi=\r\n homam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Also, don&#39;t think that Chandi homam is the only homam fo=\r\nr fast progress. Most higher deities (Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Lakshmi, Hanu=\r\nman etc) are capable of giving all material and spiritual results one may i=\r\nmagine.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you can find a deity whose homam =\r\ngenerates love and feeling inside your heart, THAT homam is the right homam=\r\n for you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In fact, even Ganapathi homam is c=\r\napable of giving everything. Because we worship Ganapathi in the beginning =\r\nof every homam, people look at Ganapathi homam as an &quot;appetizer&quot; and Chandi=\r\n homam etc as the &quot;full meal&quot;. That&#39;s not correct. Even Ganapathi homam can=\r\n be a &quot;full meal&quot;.
