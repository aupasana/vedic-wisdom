I would like to suggest from my own method\n&gt; which may =\r\nhelp you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) First of all, It=\r\n is advisable to avoid Aluminum\n&gt; Foil. Aluminum foil cutting for correct s=\r\nize and then\n&gt; adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amount of time. I did\n=\r\n&gt; it for some 6 months initially and then there was a Message\n&gt; from Narasi=\r\nmha that it is better to avoid Aluminum foil\n&gt; because Aluminum being a rel=\r\natively modern metal and may\n&gt; carry Rahu&#39;s predominance. I stopped foil si=\r\nnce then...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) No need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I do i=\r\nt once\n&gt; in a month or so. Let it be black and dark.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the=\r\n above 2 points are observed, it can save some 5\n&gt; to 7 minutes easily.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, one can do following arrangements previous nights\n&gt; (the p=\r\neople who do Homa in the morning)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Empty the Homa Kundam and=\r\n keep it clean (Tissue\n&gt; papers are very handy for this) and ready for next=\r\n morning\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Keep the Dry Coconut pieces or Wood ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Keep =\r\nthe Lamp ready with Wick\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Keep Camphor, Rice mixed with ghee and tu=\r\nrmeric,\n&gt; Flowers,  etc... ready. (I do not use flowers any more. Use\n&gt; Aks=\r\nhatas mixed with Turmeric as flowers..Bhagwan ko bolta\n&gt; hun BhavnaO ko Sam=\r\njho! Phul ki jagape Chawal se kaam\n&gt; chalalo:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when I ge=\r\nt ready for Homam, I just have to fill up\n&gt; the copper tumbler with water a=\r\nnd heat up the ghee and few\n&gt; other such activities which takes around 5to7=\r\n Minutes in\n&gt; total.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before i forget i must remind that ther=\r\ne is no need to\n&gt; keep the Darbha in 4 directions every time. One can keep\n=\r\n&gt; those Darbhas at the same place as many days as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please ignore this Fool if the post did not make much\n&gt; sense.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; HavanOtpal\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nat was=C3=82=C2=A0a nice post Ajit. I am also one of\n&gt; those people who, be=\r\ncause of guilt factor of skipping\n&gt; sandhyavandana, unable to do the homa d=\r\naily. I do it every\n&gt; week. But there is a little other logistics issue for=\r\n me. I\n&gt; live in the US and I do my homa in my living room where the\n&gt; Wood=\r\n burning Fireplace (east facing)=C3=82=C2=A0is located. My pooja\n&gt; room how=\r\never, is in a different location towards north of\n&gt; the house. I have a big=\r\n Shiva Lingam in my pooja room for\n&gt; which I do daily abhishekam in the mor=\r\nning, (with Rudra\n&gt; Adhyaya on Mondays). So, if I have do both nithyapooja =\r\nand\n&gt; homam daily, it is really time taking as arranging for homam\n&gt; takes =\r\nalmost 20 minutes, on a routine basis. Any ideas for\n&gt; managing this better=\r\n? For instance, arrangements include, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. cl=\r\neaning up the previous homam residues, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. putting new aluminium f=\r\noil in the homa kunda\n&gt; and below the homakunda, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. putting alumi=\r\nnium foils before the homa kunda\n&gt; where I keep the ghee so that any spills=\r\n would happen on the\n&gt; foil, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting chand=\r\nan and kumkum\n&gt; for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting a flowe=\r\nr\n&gt; in the kalasa.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. putting da=\r\nrbhas around the homa kunda\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the h=\r\noma kunda\n&gt; along with camphor and darbhas\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All these take from 15-20 minutes. If I have\n&gt;=\r\n time, I do have a ninth step of cooking some food for\n&gt; mahanaivedyam whic=\r\nh takes an additional 20-30 minutes. With\n&gt; all these, doing a homam and re=\r\ngular pooja in=C3=82=C2=A0a different\n&gt; place is really difficult on a dail=\r\ny basis. But I want to do\n&gt; that.

Someone I respect,\n&gt; mentioned of AupAsana=\r\n homam ...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the past, I have asked exactly the same\n&gt; =\r\nquestion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are not already doing sandhyAvandana an=\r\nd\n&gt; aupAsana (and are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing homa), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip=\r\n\n&gt; this mail altogether. If\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t wa=\r\nnt to\n&gt; stop doing it (because of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the guilt factor), and want to b=\r\netter integrate\n&gt; it with homa, this\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mail may be of some limited v=\r\nalue. I have studied\n&gt; several\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sandhyAvandana, aupAsana and homa m=\r\nanuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two\n&gt; =\r\nparts: (a) purificatory\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to=\r\n\n&gt; integrate with homa, do\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa between parts (a) and (b). The fir=\r\nst part,\n&gt; with the mArjana etc\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hardly takes 1-2 minutes. After th=\r\nat, do the\n&gt; homa. After the purnahuti\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc, you can do the second =\r\npart of sandhyAvandana\n&gt; (gayatri japa)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with the AvAhana.=\r\n Spend as much time in\n&gt; this meditation as\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can. Then, you can=\r\n do the upasthAna etc,\n&gt; which will add another 2\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes or so. C=\r\nonsider skipping all the\n&gt; elaborate nyAsas, and the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated prAn=\r\nAyAmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Really speaking, everything important is already=\r\n\n&gt; there in the homa\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; manual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot;\n&gt; proc=\r\nedure, you can pull in a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; few veda mantras if you choose to. But, i=\r\nt really\n&gt; isn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you look at aupAsana proc=\r\nedures, you will find\n&gt; that Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; manual is more elaborate =\r\nthan the aupAsana. Homa\n&gt; is basically a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; superset of aupAsana. Whe=\r\nre the manual differs,\n&gt; it is more relevant\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for our modern lifest=\r\nyle, and you don&#39;t need\n&gt; to add anything to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, I basica=\r\nlly follow Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sankalp=\r\na. They are that similar. The fire in\n&gt; which you do\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;upAsana&quot; is =\r\n&quot;aupAsana&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
