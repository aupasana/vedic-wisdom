Disregard the body\na=\r\nnd the mind. To identify with them is misery. Dive deep into the Heart, the=\r\n\nsource of being and peace, and establish yourself there.&#39;\n\nI then asked hi=\r\nm how I could attain Self-realisation and he gave me a\nsimilar answer: &#39;If =\r\nyou give up identifying with the body and meditate on\nthe Self, which you a=\r\nlready are, you can attain Self-realisation.&#39;\n\nAs I was pondering on these =\r\nremarks Bhagavan surprised me by saying, &#39;I was\nwaiting for you. I was wond=\r\nering when you would come.&#39;\n\nAs a newcomer I was still too afraid of him to=\r\n follow this up by asking how\nhe knew, or how long he had been waiting. How=\r\never, I was delighted to hear\nhim speak like this because it seemed to indi=\r\ncate that it was my destiny to\nstay with him.\n\nA few days later I asked ano=\r\nther question: &#39;Scientists have invented and\nproduced aircraft which can tr=\r\navel at great speeds in the sky. Why do you\nnot make and give us a spiritua=\r\nl aircraft in which we can quickly and easily\ncross over the sea of samsara=\r\n?&#39;\n\nRamana Maharshi: &#39;The path of self-enquiry,&#39; replied Bhagavan, &#39;is the\n=\r\naircraft you need. It is direct, fast and easy to use. You are already\ntrav=\r\nelling very quickly towards realisation. It is only because of your mind\nth=\r\nat it seems that there is no movement.In the old days, when people first\nro=\r\nde on trains, some of them believed that the trees and countryside were\nmov=\r\ning and that the train was standing still.
