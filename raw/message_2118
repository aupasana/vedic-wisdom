I am\n&gt; &gt; reproducin=\r\ng extract from Narasimha&#39;s message regarding Sanskrit grammar.\n&gt; &gt; One impo=\r\nrtant thing which has come to my mind is that, because it is\n&gt; &gt; Visarga, i=\r\nn Sanskrit scripts, it is denoted by : and NOT by  &#39;Ha&#39; akshar\n&gt; &gt; written =\r\nin devanagari. that shows that there is some important\n&gt; &gt; difference in pr=\r\nonunciation and the sound should not be made explicitly\n&gt; &gt; as Ha but one s=\r\nhould let go the air while pronouncing it.  it is\n&gt; &gt; different thing that =\r\napparently it sounds like Ha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot;=\r\n in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in\n&gt; &gt; Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated =\r\nin itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed=\r\n to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation.\n&gt; &gt; Pronunciation\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again,\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhis is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially sou=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; Indians, make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an ex=\r\ntra syllable (ha) is\n&gt; &gt; added to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mantra and that messes up eve=\r\nrything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this style of mispronounci=\r\nng visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; pronounced\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differently in &quot;r=\r\naamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounc=\r\ned as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words,\n&gt; &gt; respectively\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. ra=\r\namaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\netting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the\n&gt; &gt; 3\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; words.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also need confirmation about Vighne=\r\nshwara whom we worship as remover\n&gt; &gt; of obstacles being &gt;the creator of ob=\r\nstacles as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First time i thought about Vigneshwara in line wi=\r\nth what you mentioned.\n&gt; &gt; if we split the word which are joined then it is=\r\n Vigna + Ishwara =3D God\n&gt; &gt; of Obstacle. it can very well mean that the Go=\r\nd who controls obstacles.\n&gt; &gt; now if we derive meaning that Ganapati (Vigne=\r\nshwara) is the controller\n&gt; &gt; of Obstacles then what you mentioned seems qu=\r\nite correct because the one\n&gt; &gt; who controls obstacle has the power to put =\r\nforth the obstacle as well as\n&gt; &gt; remove it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, is the=\r\nre some significance of the trunk turned to the\n&gt; &gt; right as opposed to the=\r\n left &gt;or the middle?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do not know WHY but It is a popular opinio=\r\nn in Maharashtra and Gujarat\n&gt; &gt; (may be in the other places as well) that =\r\nMurti or picture of Ganapati\n&gt; &gt; having Right Sided trunk are very active (=\r\nLive) and hence they should be\n&gt; &gt; handled with extreme care. i mean, the i=\r\ndol or picture should never\n&gt; &gt; remain without Pujan etc... Generally peopl=\r\ne are afraid of keeping such\n&gt; &gt; a idol in their homes because they feel th=\r\nat if they are no able to\n&gt; &gt; properly worship the idol then some kind of m=\r\nisfortune will befall on\n&gt; &gt; them. Other thing is that, there is also belie=\r\nf that if the idol is\n&gt; &gt; properly propitiated then it can give great fortu=\r\nne.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; it is not out of place to mention here that about a year back =\r\nsomebody\n&gt; &gt; gave me a Ganapati idol having Right side trunk. i kept it in =\r\nmy small\n&gt; &gt; puja place. i think i hardly ever worship the idol but when i =\r\nstarted\n&gt; &gt; Homam i used to keep the idol in the homam. although i knew the=\r\n above\n&gt; &gt; belief, i was never afraid of misfortune. afterwards i came to M=\r\numbai\n&gt; &gt; for vacation and i bought another idol of metal. now i had (still=\r\n have)\n&gt; &gt; 2 idols and i used to keep only metal idol (with left side trunk=\r\n) but i\n&gt; &gt; had some kind of guilt feeling that i am not able to keep the e=\r\narlier\n&gt; &gt; one idol so i decided to give the metal idol to one of my collea=\r\ngues who\n&gt; &gt; was going to shift to a new house. i gave them the idol but th=\r\ney were\n&gt; &gt; little hesitant and gave me back. i asked my Guru about it and =\r\nhe asked\n&gt; &gt; to keep both the idols in the Homam and i started doing that. =\r\nnow during\n&gt; &gt; my Homam, there are both Ganapati present, one with Right si=\r\nde trunk and\n&gt; &gt; one with left side. one who is ready to punish and the one=\r\n who just let\n&gt; &gt; go like visarga :).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; but truly speaking, my fear =\r\nfor such things have almost gone. No\n&gt; &gt; trepidation by whatever beliefs. W=\r\nhether it is Ganapati of Right sided\n&gt; &gt; trunk or mistakes in rituals or wr=\r\nong pronunciation of veda mantra or\n&gt; &gt; such other things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have no answers for the rest of the things you asked.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; sorry if i&#39;ve deviated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, Utpalji for pointing out the correction in &quot;Ga=\r\nnapataye&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is not &quot;Nama:&quot; equivalent of NamaH?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I al=\r\nso need confirmation about Vighneshwara whom we worship as remover\n&gt; &gt; of o=\r\nbstacles being the creator of obstacles as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Afterall was h=\r\ne not the vighna in is father&#39;s path as a result of\n&gt; &gt; which he lost his h=\r\nead?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, is there some significance of the trunk turne=\r\nd to the\n&gt; &gt; right as opposed to the left or the middle?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any me=\r\naning attached to what Ganapati holds in his hands and in the\n&gt; &gt; trunk?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the meaning of &quot;Gana&quot;?...is it the elements or the energi=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; that underlie creation?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or is it the Ganas in Shiva&#39;s re=\r\ntinue?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Who are the ganas who accompany Shiva?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i saw=\r\n some videos of ganapati &quot;drinking&quot; milk and was very impressed!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Regards and best wishes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; vedic_pathak@\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nne correction for the Mantra in your message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The correct i=\r\ns &quot;Gam Ganapataye Nama:&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; na=\r\nmaste narasimha ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does the same apply to &quot;gam&quot;? yeste=\r\nrday while discussing the\n&gt; &gt; mantra &quot;Om\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gam Ganapatiye Namah&quot; wi=\r\nth a friend, she told me that &quot;gam&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pronounced as &quot;gong&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
