I think Bagavathechha is important to begin. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, \n&gt; Srin=\r\nivas \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Mar 15, 2011 at 11:50 AM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@...&gt; w=\r\nrote: \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Utpal, \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Rajarshi is correct. It is very=\r\n very difficult to burn a watery coconut with \n&gt; just copra. You need wood.=\r\n You should stick to half/whole dry coconuts instead \n&gt; of watery coconuts.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; I also use the same kind shown by Rajarshi ( http://goo.gl=\r\n/U7vzW). Though it is \n&gt; possible to offer the green ones ( http://goo.gl/2=\r\nLMio), it will take a lot more \n&gt; time (or a much bigger fire) to burn it f=\r\nully. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; I arrange two logs in parallel, separated by an inch =\r\nor so, within my homa \n&gt; kundam. I place the coconut in the middle, on top =\r\nof them. I offer it at the end \n&gt; of offerings to Ganapathi, kind of like a=\r\n poornaahuti to Ganapathi (I say &quot;OM \n&gt; gaM gaNapataye namaH, pUrNa phalaM =\r\nsamarpayaami&quot;, i.e. I offer a whole fruit). \n&gt; Then I proceed to invoke Cha=\r\nndi in the fire. By the time Chandi is invoked, the \n&gt; coconut fully cathes=\r\n fire and there is a really big fire. Then I start making \n&gt; offerings with=\r\n Chandipath (sesame seeds, ghee etc). The way I arrange the two \n&gt; logs, th=\r\ney touch the firepit walls at the edges of the logs only and they do not \n&gt;=\r\n touch the bottom surface of the pit that contains burning materials (e.g. =\r\nsesame \n&gt; seeds, murmura, nuts, copra pieces etc). So, except the edges, th=\r\ne logs are \n&gt; effectively suspended in air a little height above the burnin=\r\ng materials. That \n&gt; helps things burn nicely, with a big fire. The coconut=\r\n also burns fast and with \n&gt; a big fire. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; By the time I am i=\r\nn the middle of the second chapter, the bottom of the coconut \n&gt; starts to =\r\ncrack. If I keep it a little more time, it will break and coconut \n&gt; water =\r\nwill fall in fire. Before that happens, I turn the coconut around so that \n=\r\n&gt; the weaker (cracked) side faces up. This way, water spills in fire rarely=\r\n. \n&gt; Usually most of the water just evaporates and only small amounts spill=\r\n into \n&gt; fire. IF a lot of water falls in fire, just pour some drops of ghe=\r\ne and sprinke \n&gt; sesame seeds to increase the fire again. By the time I fin=\r\nish 13 chapters \n&gt; (sometimes even earlier), the coconut is reduced to ashe=\r\ns. At the end, I offer a \n&gt; dry coconut as poornaahuti and meditate peacefu=\r\nlly. Dry coconut burns fully by \n&gt; itself, once it catches fire. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; I experimented with various whole fresh fruits, but coconut is the b=\r\nest. \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; In general, one simple thumbrule is that materials need o=\r\nxygen supply to burn \n&gt; well. So, if wood and coconut are exposed to oxygen=\r\n (air) from as many sides as \n&gt; possible, they will burn well and with a bi=\r\ng fire. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; This is just for giving some ideas to some people w=\r\nho may be doing homam with a \n&gt; big fire. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Best regards, \n&gt; =\r\nNarasimha \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- \n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writin=\r\ngs, \n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: \n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWrit=\r\nings\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam10=\r\n8 \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Mar 15, 2011 at 7:51 AM, vedic_pathak wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi, \n&gt; \n&gt; I understood which coconut you meant. ac=\r\ntually i once offered Coconut as \n&gt; purnahuti during my last visit to India=\r\n where in My native place, i had \n&gt; performed a chandi homam with lot of wo=\r\nods.

The c=\r\noconut would take at least one and half hours to \n&gt; &gt;burn \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prop=\r\nerly. I would use that time to meditate, while pouring ghee on the \n&gt; &gt;coco=\r\nnut \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at frequent intervals. But the coconut will at one point s=\r\npurt hot water. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Normally it will spray and=C3=82=C2=A0diffuse the =\r\nfire,=C3=82=C2=A0so keep enough ghee and \n&gt; &gt;camphor \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ready!=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes however=C3=82=C2=A0the water may=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0get=C3=82=C2=A0sprayed=C3=82=C2=A0on the body of the person. \n&gt; &gt;T=\r\nhat is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why it is best if there is some reasonable gap between =\r\nthe person and the \n&gt; &gt;homa \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kunda, like in a fire pit. Prefer =\r\nlarge coconuts than smaller ones. Large \n&gt; &gt;ones \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are easier to=\r\n control in fire. Smaller coconuts are more unpredictable. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a different note, I have had a few occassions when coconuts h=\r\nave burst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uncomfortably in the kunda spraying water on me. Once my=\r\n face got scalded \n&gt; &gt;such \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I could not shave for a few we=\r\neks. However, the interesting thing is \n&gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bursting o=\r\nf a coconut and water getting sprayed maybe uncomfortable and \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npainful, BUT invariable it=C3=82=C2=A0sublimates some major karma that is c=\r\noming. It \n&gt; &gt;is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEVER a radom act. I have learnt through expe=\r\nrience. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And coconut will produce a lot of smoke =\r\ntoo. That is another factor to be \n&gt; &gt;taken \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into account.

Though dry coconu=\r\nt (copra) can also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be offered, normal fresh whole coconut with wat=\r\ner in it is a fantastic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material. Traditionally this is what was o=\r\nffered as poornaahuti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (symbolic of head, i.e. ego). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; BTW, those who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; should ignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire is practical only for those who do homam with a big fire usin=\r\ng logs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wood. You want to offer something only if you can fully =\r\nburn it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a fresh coconut is offered in fire, it will t=\r\nake a while to burn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely, because it has layers (fiber, shel=\r\nl, white stuff and water \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc, just like our own ego-consciousness!=\r\n). If one offers it in the end \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of homam, it will be a challenge to=\r\n make it burn fully. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One idea is to offer it in the begin=\r\nning instead of the end, and give it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to burn, as one goes thr=\r\nough homam. I, for example, offer a fresh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coconut in my daily homa=\r\nm at the end of offerings to Ganapathi at the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning of homam. =\r\nThen I invoke Chandi and offer Chandipath in fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with various off=\r\nerings. During the course, the fresh coconut burns fully \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and gets =\r\nreduced to ashes by the end. Having offered a whole fresh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coconut =\r\nin homam daily for six months, I can tell you that it is a very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go=\r\nod idea (if and only if it is practical in your case). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On=\r\ne risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gush at \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little understanding \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the dynamics, one should not do this if one is worried about the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inhury. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
