The thing is that\nplease understand, the differen=\r\nce between your surface personality and\nyour true self( which you realize e=\r\nventually by penance).\n\nSadhana is basically a process in which you/deity k=\r\nill your&quot;self&quot;. Let\nus say that you are\n&quot;Puneet/Nikhil/Gaurav/Chetna/Savitr=\r\ni/Mark/Andrew/John/Ali&quot;. You see, all\nahutis in the homam are actually mean=\r\nt to be sacrifice of parts of this\npersonality and eventually the whole per=\r\nsonality in the purna -ahuti\nwhere in you sacrifice your entire self to the=\r\n deity in the fire.\nActually the purna- ahuti is your funeral, if you are a=\r\nble to look at it\nin that manner.\n\nPlease understand that all joys and sorr=\r\nows are limited to your own\nfalse self. What you think is the best for your=\r\nself ,actually is more\noften than not that good. It might be good for your =\r\nlimited self, but\nmind you , it isn&#39;t good for &quot;you&quot;. And to tell you very =\r\nhonestly, god\ndoesn&#39;t really care much for your limited self and its endles=\r\ns desires,\nwants, desires. Mr god wants you to be out of this convoluted me=\r\nss, and\nbe back with him/her/it ASAP and the only way you are coming back i=\r\ns\nwhen the false self is completely free.\n\nNow how is that? You pay off Kar=\r\nma&#39;s. Now how the hell do you that? You\nsuffer and stay silent. You do not =\r\nmake a cry and hue about it and\ncontinuously chant. Crying and shouting act=\r\nually makes god sentimental\nand you extract out some stuff, maybe in the sh=\r\nort run, but it will\nscrew the &quot;real you&quot; in the long run.\n\nPlease understa=\r\nnd, none can escape suffering, for it is the only way you\ncan pay back. You=\r\n have to pay. When suffering, continuously remind\nyourself of your own conf=\r\nusion as to who you are and keep doing simple\npenance. The navagraha&#39;s and =\r\nespecially my beloved Mr Saturn are only\ndoing their duty to get you back o=\r\nn track. Their duty is to break your\nshackles, now whether they decide to d=\r\no it by breaking your back, well,\nit is their will.\n\nWhen Mr Ram, Arjun, Ka=\r\nrna, couldn&#39;t escape, who the hell are we guys\nexactly?\n\nAnd what actually =\r\nis suffering?\nbasic lack of acceptance of your own destiny and fate. Suffer=\r\ning is\nattributed to a sense of &quot; Why ME?&quot; and &quot;why not ME?&quot;, &quot; why MY thin=\r\ngs\nwere taken&quot; and &quot; Why I don&#39;t have these things&quot;\n\nKundalini shundalini i=\r\ns all too far away for 95 out of 100 of us. Let&#39;s\nleave those, because unle=\r\nss you experience it yourself , you are bound\nto confuse yourself and attri=\r\nbute mundane things to experiences to\npeople who are now progressed and thu=\r\ns digging yourself into a bigger\nhole. Apart from one book here and there, =\r\nyou won&#39;t know who is saying\nwhat. And who do you trust, the author is huma=\r\nn after all.\n\n&quot;You&quot; will have to die, no matter what if you ever hope to re=\r\nach god.\nHow do you die?\nWhen your supposed joys and things are taken from =\r\nyou, do you ever look\nat god, and cry back. That is merely the beginning. B=\r\necause without\nthese things taken from you , you will never ever look at go=\r\nd, unless\nyou are some hi-fi being from your previous birth. once you look =\r\nand\nunderstand the purpose behind it all, your cries will stop, and you wil=\r\nl\nactually be able to laugh at your own silliness in the beginning. Homam\na=\r\nccelerates this progress.\n\nHere are some wise words from Mr Nanak ------\n&quot;I=\r\nf you have to reach heaven, you have to die&quot;\nor\n&quot;Everyone wants heaven, nob=\r\nody wants to die&quot;\n\nI think then there was this another point of doing homam=\r\n on somebody&#39;&#39;s\nhalf. Here is a true story, once a girl who was facing incr=\r\nemental\ndifficulty in getting married to the boy of her dreams due to her\np=\r\narents rejection, requested another woman who regularly does homam to\ndo so=\r\nmething. Hearing her story, the homam waali woman , decided to do a\nhomam o=\r\nn the girl&#39;s behalf. here is what was said to god when he was\npresent in th=\r\ne fire.\n\n&quot; Dear God, I dedicate this one to the girl who suffers. I can&#39;t s=\r\nee her\ngetting beat by her parents and her lying in torment due to such and=\r\n\nsuch problem. eventually she is you only, why do you make yourself\nsuffer =\r\nso much? If the marriage is ordained for her, remove obstacles,\nand get her=\r\n married, and if it is not ordained, break her ties off with\nthe boy and ge=\r\nt her parents to send her off wherever you deem fit. Don&#39;t\nsatiate the desi=\r\nres of the personality, do what is best for the being\npowering the personal=\r\nity and if that best is that she is not with the\nboy of her dreams, so be i=\r\nt. but stop suffering through her&quot;\n\nThe next week, all her ties with the bo=\r\ny were severed, she got engaged\nto someone else, and is married now.\nWhat i=\r\ns the lesson??\nThe girl was wanting based on her own belief that she wants =\r\nthis and\nthat, but the homam waali woman was little more surrender -ful to =\r\ngod\nand left the whole scenario. The whole damn point of any penance is end=\r\n\nof your constant belief and desires based on your own limited self. And\nif=\r\n you keep on harping, well it defeats the purpose.\n\nRegarding the lower eth=\r\nereal beings being easily satiated and giving you\nwhat you want=85=85\nHave =\r\nyou seriously considered the price you will pay??\nThis time around mr Bhupe=\r\nndra Janmadas may get some money or the job,\nbut next time lets say your ar=\r\ne born as maithali gupta , the price you\nwill have to pay will be too immen=\r\nse.\nThen you will ask &quot;why me?&quot; and again start the whole process, thus\nsli=\r\nding further and further.\nDon&#39;t go down those routes, this is not a one bir=\r\nth game, you won&#39;t be\ndead, no matter how many personalities you may shed a=\r\nnd die in, you will\nstill be there and boy you will pay.\n\nAnd the fees of t=\r\nhe ethereal beings? I can&#39;t shake my head enough.\nLets skip ethereal beings=\r\n , access to them is anyways blocked for 99 out\n100 for us.\n\nAap ke toh naa=\r\nm mein hi sir, janmadas hai, janmo ke das, aap sarne ke\nliye aaye hain, sar=\r\n li jiye, jab achha hona hoga, ho jayega, if you\nthink you can force a chan=\r\nge, forget it.\n\nAur aapki saran is only limited to bhupinder, yeh bechara t=\r\noh kabhi bhi\nmar jaayega, jald hi naak mein rui aur muh mein ghee, aur para=\r\n hoga jal\nraha hoga, lekin tum reh jaaoge.\n\nKeep doing your homams, they wi=\r\nll help &quot;you&quot;, trust god on this.\n\nRegarding the prarbadha karma&#39;s, sanchit=\r\n karma&#39;s and everything else,\nyou will end up confusing yourself, seriously=\r\n, it is a mess to\nunderstand without penance and a deity or a deity like gu=\r\nru. Everybody\nis trying to calculate based on whatever information about th=\r\ne system\nthey have. Here is a fun fact:  _--------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\nYOU CAN&#39;T CALCULAT=\r\nE.\n\nThis system is too layered, too complex, and without you in touch with\n=\r\nan advance being and god, forget it. Forget all of this. Focus on god as\nmu=\r\nch as one can. And please let go of this expectation that worshipping\ngod c=\r\nan get you the monies, the comforts. If actual progress is there,\nquite the=\r\n opposite is going to happen in most cases, but there is no\nformula and qui=\r\nte a lot of good can happen.\nIt just depends on what god decides. If you ar=\r\ne meant to enjoy, you\nwill, if no oh well, that too.\n\nDekho bhaiyon aur beh=\r\neno, pichle janmon ka ab toh kuch nahin kar sakte\nwoh kaand to ho gaye, ab =\r\niss baar sambhal jaao, aur bhagwan ki taraf\nrukh karlo, is baar mauka hai, =\r\nnahin toh next time around again the same\nroutine ------\nborn crying\nsuckin=\r\ng on breast\nplaying with toy\nhitting puberty\ngoing mad with lust\ncareer iss=\r\nues\njob issues\nhealth issues\nwife\nchild\nchildren\nHeart attack\nPHAT!\n\nand ag=\r\nain crying without a body what did i do , what did i do, making\nthe pledge =\r\nin the womb, that god i&#39;ll worship you and coming out then\nforgetting every=\r\nthing. The circle won&#39;t end. It just won&#39;t end.\n\nAnd do it not for exiting,=\r\n do it for the love of god. Develop this love,\nhow can you then afford to s=\r\ntay away from your lover.\n\nIf the lover/owner of your &quot;self&quot; decides that y=\r\nou so &quot;suffer&quot; so that\nyou can visit him/her, oh well then Suffer.\n\nYour su=\r\nffering is actually false, stop crying &quot;me, me, me, me , why me\netc&quot; and yo=\r\nu will likely move to where you are trying to be sent.\nContinue with this r=\r\nadio, you are digging yourself a grave.
