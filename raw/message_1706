If a \nday is a special day and/or one has more time, one option is to repeat the \nsame mantra used everyday more times. If one does a mantra 28 times everyday \nin homam, one can do it 108 times when one has time. If one has more time, \none can do it 216 times. And so on. Mind always wants variety and finds it \ndifficult to focus on ONE thing and wants variety. But it is a tendency we \nneed to eventually overcome.\n\nAlso, Ramakrishna used to say &quot;if you want water, dig 100 feet in one place \ninstead of digging 5 ft in 20 places.&quot; All the energy one has for spiritual \nsadhana can be directed at ONE thing - one mantra, one deity and one \nsadhana.\n\nOf course, those who have a taste for many things can do many things based \non the occasion, but I want to point out the other option.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 1:36 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Any suuggestions for Shani amavasya ?&lt;EOM&gt;\n\n\n&gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you, i understand your point.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was asking the question over n above the regular homam that i do daily, \n&gt; thinking if on these special days, will it help us a bit more if we also \n&gt; offer anything specific to those dieties in the homam.Sorry for the \n&gt; confusion if i have created any.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Instead of doing a different\n&gt;&gt; mantra/sadhana/pooja based on the occasion, do the same thing at every\n&gt;&gt; opportunity. Whether you pick Mahaganapathi homam or Hare Krishna mantra \n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; Chandipath or Vishnu sahasra or a Narasimha mantra or a Shiva mantra,\n&gt;&gt; whatever it is, do it whenever you get a chance. Whether it is a regular \n&gt;&gt; day\n&gt;&gt; or Shani Amavasya or Akshaya Triteeya or Rishi Panchami or Vaisakha \n&gt;&gt; Pournima\n&gt;&gt; or whatever special day, keep doing the same thing again and again\n&gt;&gt; tirelessly. That way you will eventually succeed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Friday, April 24, 2009 2:40 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Any suuggestions for Shani amavasya ?&lt;EOM&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n"}}
