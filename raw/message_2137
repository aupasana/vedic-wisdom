I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n=C2=A0\nN=\r\near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and =\r\nyogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expre=\r\nssed before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had co=\r\nme for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was =\r\nto manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence=\r\n into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as E=\r\narth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within he=\r\nr material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurob=\r\nindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, w=\r\nho later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of=\r\n intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal un=\r\ncertainties we face today.\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo saw that the divine forc=\r\ne permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consci=\r\nousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is ca=\r\nlled involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out o=\r\nf matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reac=\r\nhed a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his=\r\n inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of =\r\nwhat he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD tha=\r\nt would entirely change everything on Earth.\n=EF=BF=BD\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatn=\r\ness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible=\r\n. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most p=\r\neople, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from des=\r\ncent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divin=\r\ne plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contrad=\r\nict it.\n\nSri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolut=\r\nionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tr=\r\nemendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prev=\r\nent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified bef=\r\nore her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind,=\r\n what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fie=\r\nlds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down int=\r\no cellular consciousness.\n\nEvolution took a great leap forward with the ori=\r\ngins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the thres=\r\nhold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the em=\r\nergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human e=\r\nvolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Ea=\r\nrth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a ra=\r\ntional being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from=\r\n contacting and merging with it.\n=EF=BF=BD\nNext is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human=\r\n,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the infl=\r\nuence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able =\r\nto merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a d=\r\nense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which i=\r\ns supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular conscious=\r\nness. \n=C2=A0\nFinally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupra=\r\nmental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms o=\r\nf matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Mast=\r\ners.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be full=\r\ny realized upon Earth.\n\nThe great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was =\r\nin bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness =\r\nof their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that=\r\n the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the co=\r\nnsciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower i=\r\nnto its full manifestation in collective matter.\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=\r\n=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and th=\r\ne Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD =\r\nessentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the As=\r\nura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the As=\r\nura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and whic=\r\nh seem to be in control of current global events. According to them the Asu=\r\nra of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and t=\r\nhe Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two st=\r\nill remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura =\r\nof Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War I=\r\nI, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It wo=\r\nuld not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other wo=\r\nrld leaders in the current political sphere.\n\nWith the descent of this new =\r\nvibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demol=\r\nished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be =\r\nenormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth aut=\r\nomatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Fa=\r\nlsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonizat=\r\nion which could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic strug=\r\ngle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their origina=\r\nl emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to sp=\r\neculate, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might=\r\n have experienced if not for this power of harmonization!\n\nWhen does all th=\r\nis happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was s=\r\net for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother sai=\r\nd in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that=\r\n it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this =\r\nminimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would b=\r\ne a turning point.\n=C2=A0\nThis was a very interesting read and matches what=\r\n Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0=\r\nRajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Love Cricket?

I am posting it here for anyo=\r\nne interested.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter=\r\n and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been =\r\nexpressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time h=\r\nad come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine=\r\n was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emer=\r\ngence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even=\r\n as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held with=\r\nin her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra=\r\n Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a=\r\n journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the =\r\ncolossal uncertainties we face today.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo saw tha=\r\nt the divine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has =\r\na force of\n consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down=\r\n into matter is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends =\r\nback upwards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo,=\r\n humanity has reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultan=\r\neously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experien=\r\ncing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciou=\r\nsness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but i=\r\nn what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if=\r\n seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, eve=\r\nn if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality=\r\n. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer=\r\n senses seems to contradict it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutio=\r\nnary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made trem=\r\nendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to preven=\r\nt its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified befor=\r\ne her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, w=\r\nhat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the field=\r\ns of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into =\r\ncellular consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Evolution took a great leap forward =\r\nwith the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now =\r\nat the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepar=\r\ne for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stage=\r\ns of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurre=\r\nntly upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current s=\r\npecies, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obs=\r\ntructed from contacting and merging with it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =\r\nbirth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=\r\nhat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=\r\nind-consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a=\r\n dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which=\r\n is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular conscio=\r\nusness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Fi=\r\nnally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This w=\r\nill be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In=\r\n this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon =\r\nEarth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in=\r\n bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of=\r\n their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that t=\r\nhe supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the cons=\r\nciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower int=\r\no its full manifestation in collective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Whenever there is a =EF=\r\n=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and=\r\n the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is th=\r\ne Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and th=\r\ne Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and =\r\nwhich seem to be in control of current global events. According to them the=\r\n Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, a=\r\nnd the Asura of Suffering has\n returned to Source, and so only the latter t=\r\nwo still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the A=\r\nsura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World =\r\nWar II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. =\r\nIt would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing oth=\r\ner world leaders in the current political sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With the d=\r\nescent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human struc=\r\ntures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although t=\r\nhe changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The=\r\n power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most =\r\npart consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a =\r\npower of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means other =\r\nthan dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed=\r\n into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may b=\r\ne interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the d=\r\nestruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization=\r\n!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother=\r\n believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that i=\r\nt was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transfor=\r\nmation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of =\r\ndestruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD=\r\n She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/=\r\nU&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This was a very interesting read and matches what Naras=\r\nimhaji says about changes coming in the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT co=\r\nlor=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Sh=\r\niva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABL=\r\nE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--3--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Lookin=\r\ng for local information?
