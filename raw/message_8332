deities, which dir=\r\nection should the idol be in, this , that , its too much noise.\nWorship god=\r\n as an ignorant child ,a lover lost in love, then you will automatically kn=\r\now what to do.\n\nTumhen bhagwan chahiye, ya experiences???\n Everybody is aft=\r\ner the results of a homam, kyun bhai business deal chal rahi yahan pe, yah =\r\npooja??\n\nYeh blog waali sadhna tum tab karna ya karmon ka hisaab lagana jab=\r\n tumhen pehle bhagwaan se sacha pyaar ho, jab sacha pyaar hoga, toh &quot;tum&quot; t=\r\noh beech mein hoge nahin, sadhana bhi siddh, minimal karmas, plus connectio=\r\nn with god will come then.\n\nFools approach these practices for &quot;experiences=\r\n&quot;, &quot;powers&quot;, and get stuck there.\n\nFirst have the love to play this to your=\r\n chosen form of your wroship\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DzkbaRP8xtLI\n=\r\n\nAnd for saadhnas like those mentioned in that blog, try playing the song f=\r\nor beings who appear &quot;fierce&quot;, for beings whom &quot;you&quot; are ready to die for, =\r\nfor a form of god that you will go all out for.\n\nOnce there was a man in Gu=\r\njrat, who hankered on and on and on how will do anything for god, one night=\r\n in a cremation ground  he was given an axe, a bottle of whiskey ( to get D=\r\nrunk), and was told , Cut your arm off for god, you said you will do anythi=\r\nng right??? Plus you are not the body this the dialogue you have been givin=\r\ng to everyone, now stay true to your words.\n\nBete, jo saadhnaayen sab ko it=\r\nna lubhati hain na, woh tumhe acchi tarah se test bhi karti hain. A &quot;right&quot;=\r\n person as mentioned by Rajarshi equates to a person first in love with god=\r\n, then toh you can walk on this path, otherwise instead of going up, you wi=\r\nll crash and burn for millions of existences, till a higher being takes pit=\r\ny on you.\n\nIsliye chuck all this and focus on doing as much worship as poss=\r\nible in this birth, chant as much as you can, as many homams, as much celib=\r\nacy.\n\nIf any of these sadhnas are in your destiny, don&#39;t worry god will ope=\r\nn doors, automatically, till then worship, worship with love.\n\nDo a homam t=\r\no celebrate god, not to do a business deal subconsciously EVER.  \n\nKhair ch=\r\nhoro, whom am I, it was not directed at you priyank, never take it as that,=\r\n aaj scotch thori kam rah gayi saali, isliye gusaa aa raha tha, bare dino s=\r\ne socha ki kuch type karen, aaj mauka mila.\n\nBhagwan ko pyaar karne ke liye=\r\n pooja karo, wohi siddh hai baki sab bakwaas hai\n\nBhagwaan se pyaar karo ja=\r\nise baaki larke larkiyon se karte ho, sachcha pyar jisme jaan bhi jaaye toh=\r\n kya gum hai, hamara mehboob khush hona chahiye. Jab yeh aajaaye phir vam m=\r\narga pe chalo toh 3 second mein assamn mein ur jaaoge, nahin toh kabar khud=\r\n jaayegi..\n\nLeft can&#39;t ever exist without the right. Right is imperative, n=\r\not for safety, but its too much filled with love. For the one who can actua=\r\nlly love god, there are no heights high enough. \n\nChant any name of god as =\r\nmuch as you can. Once god becomes your beloved, then you&#39;ll be telling this=\r\n to others. You will not care for puraan&#39;s, reading materials, religious te=\r\nxts, you won&#39;t have time to think, you&#39;ll be lost, and combine that with a =\r\nritual like a homam =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D ( Equals to ) =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D\nThis song will be playing in the background once that combinat=\r\nion is achieved\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DFbO9RUMTfvA\n\nEverything w=\r\nill automatically make sense to you, all the texts, all the stuff.\n\nKhair, =\r\nanyways, repeat the sweet sweet name of god, leave aside all these karmic c=\r\nalculations and everything else.

Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are often done for material g=\r\nains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras of various deities contain a =\r\nphalastuti (the expected results), is that not material gain? Doing a Maham=\r\nrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn&#39;t that a material gain? It is no=\r\nt the path, but the attitude of the sadhaka which determines for what he/sh=\r\ne is performing a certain sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yogis and/or those who do =\r\nsadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, wh=\r\nich can come as a byproduct of the path. The problem is not with siddhis pe=\r\nr se, it is with misusing them or commercializing them or hanging on to the=\r\nm. Any sadhaka who can gain a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenev=\r\ner he/she wants. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma o=\r\nf it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it stands today, is roughly divided into two major g=\r\neographic and philosophical demarcations. The style practiced in South Indi=\r\na - mostly Dakshina Margi - and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent areas=\r\n - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal opinion, the adherents of the path in =\r\nboth cases, generally speaking, have been trapped in two delusions born out=\r\n of collateral byproducts of their respective paths. The first step of Shak=\r\nti sadhana is generating shakti. Second step is holding the shakti. Third s=\r\ntep is channeling the shakti. In view of this, one school of Tantra that is=\r\n prevalent today has tied itself up in too much of technicalities, such tha=\r\nt on an average they forget to capture shakti (here shakti means energy, no=\r\nt Shakti the supreme Goddess). WHile the other school is able to generate a=\r\nnd hold shakti much better, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it=\r\n (generally speaking,\n&gt; &gt;  expcetions are there too). End result, both even=\r\ntually do not end up producing enough genuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one mig=\r\nht be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vima=\r\nlananda says. Theoretically, when the *right person* performs many of the t=\r\nhings mentioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff there is not exactly a=\r\nccurately portrayed), he/she will know how to balance the karmic impact wel=\r\nl. In the hands of an immature individual, it can lead to disaster. Further=\r\n, the so called division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is no=\r\nt as sharp and clear as it is made out there. Each influences the other and=\r\n is very much intermingled.=C2=A0 Every sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a =\r\nfirm spiritual basis. Performed correctly, with the right attitude, and by =\r\nthe right individual, it leads to very high spiritual states.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Reg=\r\nards\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain=\r\n duniya mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; &gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masia=\r\nh mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;  From: priy=\r\nank_priyank &lt;aks_day@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tues=\r\nday, 12 June 2012 10:14 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Karmic liability for=\r\n Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Hello all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI have been following some tantra groups and in tantra there seems to be 3 =\r\nattitudes. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. IShta sadhana - complete surrender\n&gt; &gt; 2. Siddhi sa=\r\ndhana - for gaining specific siddhi (part bhog part moksha)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. Mat=\r\nerial sadhana - related to bhog part of life. you do this specifically for =\r\nthe result you want. here there are sadhanas right from kuber sadhanas to a=\r\npsara/urvashi to making pact with lot of entities (from ghosts to whatnot).=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities =\r\none might be getting into ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; related reading\n&gt; &gt; http://aghorpir.bl=\r\nogspot.in/2012/05/classical-and-folk-tantra.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; priya=\r\nnk\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
