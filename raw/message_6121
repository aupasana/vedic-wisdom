Does one need to keep any caution or =\r\nfollow rules while praying Lord Hanuman. \n\n2) There is a priest in a temple=\r\n in Mumbai who claims that divine energy enters his body every evening. He =\r\nstarts dancing till blood oozes of his mouth and nose. Just like people get=\r\n possessed with ghosts is there something like divine energy entering a bod=\r\ny. Is there any truth to this or just fake? \n\nThanks and regards,\n\nPriya\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
