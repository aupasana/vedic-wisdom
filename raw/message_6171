It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit\n&gt; t=\r\nhat a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel.\n=\r\n&gt; But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They ca=\r\nrry\n&gt; that habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the=\r\n North\n&gt; Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;=\r\ns Bhaja\n&gt; Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh m=\r\natE&quot;, which\n&gt; sounded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to langu=\r\nages like Braj\n&gt; Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacha=\r\nrita Manasa&quot; is\n&gt; more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pro=\r\nnounce Avadhi also\n&gt; without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong=\r\n feeling that, that\n&gt; approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri=\r\n Gurucharana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Saroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like=\r\n that and not like &quot;Sri\n&gt; Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned V=\r\nedic\n&gt; scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda =\r\nmantras)\n&gt; incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is=\r\n not everything. Having devotion and\n&gt; the spirit of surrender to god is ev=\r\nen more important. However,\n&gt; pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, co=\r\nrrect pronunciation is very\n&gt; important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciatio=\r\nn of a Veda mantra can stop one\n&gt; from the most complete experience of the =\r\nmantra. In fact, we have a lot of\n&gt; people who can memorize and repeat Veda=\r\n mantras, but very few who can\n&gt; actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct\n&gt; =\r\npronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that\n&gt; =\r\ncorrect pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of=\r\n\n&gt; the errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ig=\r\nnore\n&gt; my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to c=\r\nhanging\n&gt; your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and a=\r\ndopt my\n&gt; suggestions if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words l=\r\nike &quot;prachodayaat&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and =\r\nscholars pronounce this\n&gt; sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something l=\r\nike &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot;\n&gt; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corruption=\r\n came into practice, but it\n&gt; is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one\n&gt; letter/syllable/aksha=\r\nra. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding\n&gt; a vowel sound at =\r\nthe end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number\n&gt; of aksharas, =\r\nchanges the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may\n&gt; still experien=\r\nce something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never\n&gt; experience=\r\n the mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life\n&gt; force) =\r\nof an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it,\n&gt; the=\r\nn it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For\n&gt; exa=\r\nmple, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you\n&gt; c=\r\nannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you\n&gt;=\r\n pronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat=\r\n&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because\n&gt; &quot;t&quot; has no praana by it=\r\nself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has\n&gt; the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as i=\r\nts praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas,\n&gt; &quot;yaat&quot; is consi=\r\ndered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot;\n&gt; correctly, it is d=\r\nifficult for the listener to know for sure whether you\n&gt; said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;ya=\r\nak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully,\n&gt; but otherwise dif=\r\nficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt\n&gt; transient sound wit=\r\nhout praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This make=\r\ns people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;i&quot; or some othe=\r\nr vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a\n&gt; praana and be=\r\ncomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the\n&gt; chhandas ch=\r\nanges.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronounci=\r\nng &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot;\n&gt; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very=\r\n clear to hear, so that\n&gt; his students would not get confused when learning=\r\n. Probably the students\n&gt; thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;=\r\n) and got used to that\n&gt; mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standar=\r\nd practice after a couple\n&gt; of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pr=\r\nonounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to\n&gt; &quot;paaththu&quot;. You =\r\nsay &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it\n&gt; there. You don&#39;=\r\nt force an vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing\n&gt; holds for &quot;=\r\nt&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n What I said about words ending in consonants applies to all\n&gt; consonants a=\r\nnd not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. There\n&gt; can be wo=\r\nrds that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normally\n&gt; add an a=\r\nrtificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas\n&gt; and alt=\r\nering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound=\r\n &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D\n&gt; story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;=\r\ndha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money).\n&gt; In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbol=\r\ns of tha and dha looks very similar\n&gt; and just one dot in the middle is dif=\r\nferent. It is possible that some people\n&gt; started mispronouncing this sound=\r\n because of their inability to see the dot\n&gt; and others started following. =\r\nNow pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream\n&gt; and one pronouncing correctl=\r\ny will be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not Engli=\r\nsh. We never have two different symbols for\n&gt; the same sound or two differe=\r\nnt sounds for the same symbol. The letters\n&gt; &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different =\r\nand their sounds are different too. Pronounce\n&gt; &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body =\r\nor &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to\n&gt; get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kath=\r\naa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas,=\r\n people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama\n&gt; moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyarth=\r\nam&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the\n&gt; purusharthas (purposes of human existe=\r\nnce) - dharma (fulfilling duties),\n&gt; artha (work and money), kaama (fulfill=\r\ning desires) and moksha (developing\n&gt; detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pron=\r\nouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as\n&gt; &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It mean=\r\ns &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;.\n&gt; Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half atta=\r\ninment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a\n&gt; human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in thi=\r\ns sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen\n&gt; it committed by many many tra=\r\nined priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Poura=\r\nnika mantras, pay attention\n&gt; to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and=\r\n learn to pronounce them\n&gt; differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the =\r\nmantra, pay extra attention\n&gt; to ensure that you are not confusing tha for =\r\ndha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are severa=\r\nl other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by\n&gt; most people in the pronunc=\r\niation of Sanskrit mantras.

It is=\r\n indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist b=\r\ny itself and its life is given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason in Hin=\r\ndi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other language=\r\ns as well and recently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers (I do=\r\nn&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bh=\r\naj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded =\r\nquite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha =\r\nand Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; i=\r\ns more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadh=\r\ni also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that,=\r\n that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharan=\r\na&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Saroja&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounc=\r\ned exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.

Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even mo=\r\nre important. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct p=\r\nronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Ve=\r\nda mantra can stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In =\r\nfact, we have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but=\r\n very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will=\r\n write my views on correct pronunciation and point out some common errors. =\r\nIf you do not think that correct pronunciation is important or if you disag=\r\nree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want to change your p=\r\nronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On the other hand,=\r\n if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give a consideratio=\r\nn to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the=\r\n end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;,=\r\n &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this soun=\r\nd incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason w=\r\nhy this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachod=\r\nayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If =\r\nyou change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowe=\r\nl sound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of a=\r\nksharas, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still e=\r\nxperience something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never exper=\r\nience the mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot=\r\n;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have j=\r\nust a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is ksha=\r\nra and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&q=\r\nuot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound =\r\nand the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no lif=\r\ne force.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot=\r\n;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Becau=\r\nse &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &q=\r\nuot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and become=\r\ns part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one let=\r\nter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is diffic=\r\nult for the listener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or =\r\n&quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens careful=\r\nly, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick a=\r\nnd abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add=\r\n some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or =\r\n&quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;=\r\nt&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly become=\r\ns an akshara and the chhandas changes.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;=\r\nyaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itse=\r\nlf and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students would not get confu=\r\nsed when learning. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu=\r\n&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation=\r\n. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce th=\r\ne English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quo=\r\nt;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant an=\r\nd leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end=\r\n. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in =\r\nconsonants applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &qu=\r\not;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. There can be words that end in &qu=\r\not;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normally add an ar=\r\ntificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas and alteri=\r\nng the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&=\r\nquot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce th=\r\nis as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Ka=\r\nnnada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one d=\r\not in the middle is different. It is possible that some people started misp=\r\nronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot and others =\r\nstarted following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pro=\r\nnouncing correctly will be the odd person out.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two di=\r\nfferent symbols for the same sound or two different sounds for the same sym=\r\nbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and thei=\r\nr sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot;=\r\n =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get=\r\n &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, pe=\r\nople say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyarth=\r\nam&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of huma=\r\nn existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (f=\r\nulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people en=\r\nd up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha =\r\nkaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. =\r\nEven &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;pu=\r\nrushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this =\r\nsankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many many trained=\r\n priests!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When yo=\r\nu read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference=\r\n between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them di=\r\nfferently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, p=\r\nay extra attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (i=\r\nn my view) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit ma=\r\nntras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever =\r\nthe Mother allows me to.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into considerat=\r\nion in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#3=\r\n9;t find any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by you=\r\nr gurus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pro=\r\nnunciation. But, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the worl=\r\nd, I am guessing that there are SOME who are destined to change their pronu=\r\nnciation based on my views. That is why I am writing these mails.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do not like this di=\r\nscussion, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nrasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.SriJagannath.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n =\r\n   \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Hari Sarma.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0016e644def2fb39a004a0973986--\r\n\n"}}
