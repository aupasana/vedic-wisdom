We have read\nsevera=\r\nl books on philosophy and are attracted by Vedanta. So we read the\nUpanisha=\r\nds, Yoga Vasishta, Bhagavad Gita, etc. We try to meditate, but there\nis no =\r\nprogress in our meditation. We do not understand how to realise. Can\nyou ki=\r\nndly help us towards realisation?\n\nB.: How do you meditate?\n\nL.: I begin by=\r\n asking myself `Who am I?&#39; and eliminate the body as not `I&#39;,\nthe breath as=\r\n not `I&#39;, the mind as not `I&#39;, but then I am unable to proceed\nfurther.\n\nB.=\r\n: Well, that is all right so far as the mind goes. Your process is only\nmen=\r\ntal. Actually all the scriptures mention this process only in order to\nguid=\r\ne the seeker to the Truth. The Truth cannot be directly indicated; that\nis =\r\nwhy this mental process is used. You see, he who eliminates all the\n`not-I&#39;=\r\n cannot eliminate the `I&#39;. In order to be able to say `I am not this&#39;\nor `I=\r\n am That&#39;, there must be the `I&#39; to say it. This `I&#39; is only the ego,\nor th=\r\ne `I&#39;-thought. After the rising up of this `I&#39;-thought, all other\nthoughts =\r\narise. The `I&#39;-thought is therefore the root thought. If the root\nis pulled=\r\n out, all the rest is uprooted at the same time. Therefore seek the\nroot `I=\r\n&#39;; question yourself: `Who am I?&#39;; find out the source of the `I&#39;.\nThen all=\r\n these problems will vanish and the pure Self alone will remain.\n\nL.: But h=\r\now am I to do it?\n\nB.: The `I&#39; is always there, whether in deep sleep, in d=\r\nream or in the\nwaking state. The one who sleeps is the same as the one who =\r\nis now speaking.\nThere is always the feeling of `I&#39;. If it were not so you =\r\nwould have to deny\nyour existence. But you do not. You say: `I am&#39;. Find ou=\r\nt who is.\n\nL.: I still do not understand. You say the `I&#39; is now the false =\r\n`I&#39;. How am\nI to eliminate this wrong `I&#39;?\n\nB.: You need not eliminate any =\r\nfalse `I&#39;. How can `I&#39; eliminate itself? All\nthat you need do is to find ou=\r\nt its origin and stay there. Your effort can\nextend only so far. Then the B=\r\neyond will take care of itself. You are\nhelpless there. No effort can reach=\r\n It.\n\nL.: If `I&#39; am always -- here and now -- why do I not feel so?\n\nB.: Wh=\r\no says that you do not? Does the real `I&#39; or the false `I&#39;? Ask\nyourself an=\r\nd you will find that it is the false `I&#39;. The false `I&#39; is the\nobstruction =\r\nwhich has to be removed in order that the true `I&#39; may cease to\nbe hidden. =\r\nThe feeling `I have not realised&#39; is the obstruction to\nrealisation. In fac=\r\nt, it is already realised. There is nothing more to be\nrealised. If there w=\r\nere, realisation would be something new which did not\nyet exist, but was to=\r\n come about in the future; but whatever is born will\nalso die. If realisati=\r\non is not eternal, it is not worth having. Therefore,\nwhat we seek is not s=\r\nomething that must begin to exist but only that which\nis eternal but is vei=\r\nled from us by obstructions. All that we need do is to\nremove the obstructi=\r\non. What is eternal is not recognised as such, owing to\nignorance. Ignoranc=\r\ne is the obstruction. Get rid of it and all will be well.\nThis ignorance is=\r\n identical with the `I&#39;-thought. Find its source and it\nwill vanish.\n\nThe `=\r\nI&#39;-thought is like a spirit which, although not palpable, rises up\nsimultan=\r\neously with the body, flourishes with it and disappears with it. The\nbody-c=\r\nonsciousness is the wrong `I&#39;. Give it up. You can do so by seeking\nthe sou=\r\nrce of `I&#39;. The body does not say: `I am&#39;. It is you who say `I am\nthe body=\r\n.&#39; Find out who this `I&#39; is. Seek its source and it will vanish.\n\nSource: f=\r\nrom The Teachings of Bhagavan in His Own Words\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd5946c2bc1d20489494b7f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nTwo Parsi ladies arrived from Ahmedabad and spoke with Bhagavan.=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L.: Bhagavan, we have been spiritually inclined from childhoo=\r\nd.
