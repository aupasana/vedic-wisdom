It is a state of intense =\r\nmental concentration on something.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kalpa means create or perceive =\r\n(the word kalpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variet=\r\ny. Savikalpa means &quot;with vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense =\r\nconcentration of the mind, while creational variety or objectification stil=\r\nl exists in the mind. One perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;oth=\r\ner&quot; objects (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus th=\r\ne mind intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness w=\r\nith that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and =\r\nmany great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In nirvi=\r\nkalpa samadhi, the creational variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalp=\r\na=3D nir+vikalpa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no =\r\nperception of I and &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness is absorbed in sup=\r\nreme consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety=\r\n of objects. This state is reached by very very few yogis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sahaja =\r\nsamadhi is a state where the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety =\r\nof objects *and* absorbed in the supreme consciousness!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; When one is normally perceiving a variety objects, one&#39;s mind is absor=\r\nbed in an *individualized* consciousness that is colored with the condition=\r\ning of that individual&#39;s experiences over various lives. When one sees a be=\r\nautiful person, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts (depending on the exper=\r\niences, values and desires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is p=\r\nraising one, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. When somebody is criticiz=\r\ning one, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. And so on. One&#39;s mind has lik=\r\nes, dislikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experie=\r\nnces, values and desires of that individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In =\r\nsahaja samadhi, one has no individualized consciousness and one&#39;s mind is a=\r\nbsorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness that is not colored by the ex=\r\nperiences and conditioning of a single individual. One is actively living i=\r\nn the material world; one&#39;s mind is perceiving various objects of various a=\r\nttributes through jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind is engaging in various acti=\r\nons in the material world though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualiz=\r\ned conditioning or I-ness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Very very very few beings, mostly re-in=\r\ncarnations of rishis and gods, can reach that state. For most others, that =\r\nstate is not really a possibility.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I gave an analog=\r\ny earlier to explain various aspects of consciousness, using parts of a com=\r\nputer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU\n&gt; &gt; chitta (conditioning) - DRAM\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; buddhi - ALU or logic coprocessor\n&gt; &gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt; &gt; jnanend=\r\nriyas - input channels\n&gt; &gt; karmendriyas - output channels\n&gt; &gt; praanas - on-=\r\nboard power supply\n&gt; &gt; deha (body) - mechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Normally, CPU is running a complex program where a lot of input channels a=\r\nnd output channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is ref=\r\nreshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms based on stored da=\r\nta and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This=\r\n is analogous to a person&#39;s normal state.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is li=\r\nke a state where the computer is in a power standby. On-board power supply =\r\nis hardly supplying any power, all input and output channels are turned off=\r\n, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is not running any algorithms. If a =\r\ncomputer goes into power standy and exits it quickly, it will resume what i=\r\nt was doing before. Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and lea=\r\nving it quickly will resume previous activities. If a computer stays in the=\r\n power standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state may be los=\r\nt, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, =\r\none will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activities.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer running a bare minimum program t=\r\nhat accesses a program running on a central super computer on a network. CP=\r\nU, ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer and our individu=\r\nal computer&#39;s CPU simply has a small routine that accesses the results of t=\r\nhe algorithm running on the super computer and controls the local I/O contr=\r\noller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much data stored locally and there is no alg=\r\norithm running locally. One&#39;s praanas are supplying power, one&#39;s jnanendriy=\r\nas are getting inputs and one&#39;s karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one&#39;s=\r\n manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is contr=\r\nolling all this by running a small program that accesses a super computer t=\r\nhat is monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding what this com=\r\nputer should do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I said, very very very few bein=\r\ngs can reach sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of even the greatest=\r\n yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some re=\r\nach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness after a while an=\r\nd start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is ru=\r\nnning some program or the other, however small, and accumulating more data =\r\nin DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is poss=\r\nible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very difficult! If any li=\r\nmited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I need this, I like t=\r\nhis etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack o=\r\nf limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme universal I-ness dir=\r\nectly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I cannot make judgments on individua=\r\nl claims, as it is none of my business. I will take on individuals only whe=\r\nn they interfere with my dharma and my sense of dharma dictates that I shou=\r\nld take them on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state i=\r\ns no joke and only yogis of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Thos=\r\ne who reach this state are like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me give another analogy. This life is like a lon=\r\ng dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa =\r\nsamadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in t=\r\nhe dream and yet being awake.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This may confuse people, but this an=\r\nalogy shows how complex and difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous compu=\r\nter analogy highlights how things work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not sh=\r\now why and how difficult it is.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and how is it different from nirvikalpa samadhi?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is =\r\na fully Enlightened Master living in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n      Keep up with people you care about with Yahoo!

In sahaja samadhi, one is=\r\n simultaneously aware of Shiva and Shakti and aware of them as One.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nNormally, when the mind is perceiving the objects of dual polarities using =\r\njnanendriyas and the mind is engaging in actions of dual polarities using k=\r\narmendriyas, it is difficult to not accumulate any conditioning such as lik=\r\nes, dislikes and impressions, and keep the consciousness absorbed in the Ab=\r\nsolute.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- =\r\nvedic_pathak &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dv=\r\nedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:v=\r\nedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Let me give another analogy.

It is a state of intense mental concentration on=\r\n something.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kalpa means create or perceive (the =\r\nword kalpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Sa=\r\nvikalpa means &quot;with vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense conce=\r\nntration of the mind, while creational variety or objectification still exi=\r\nsts in the mind. One perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;other&quot; o=\r\nbjects (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the min=\r\nd intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with t=\r\nhat object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many =\r\ngreat yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; In nirvikalpa samadhi,\n the creational variety and objectification cea=\r\nses (nirvikalpa=3D nir+vikalpa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state wher=\r\ne there is no perception of I and &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness is a=\r\nbsorbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perceptio=\r\nn of a variety of objects. This state is reached by very very few yogis.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is a state where the mind is *simul=\r\ntaneously* perceiving a variety of objects *and* absorbed in the supreme co=\r\nnsciousness!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen one is normally perceiving a variety objects, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in =\r\nan *individualized* consciousness that is colored with the conditioning of =\r\nthat individual&#39;s experiences over various lives. When one sees a beautiful=\r\n person, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts (depending on the experiences,=\r\n values and desires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is praising=\r\n one, one&#39;s mind may get\n certain thoughts. When somebody is criticizing on=\r\ne, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. And so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, di=\r\nslikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, =\r\nvalues and desires of that individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; In sahaja samadhi, one has no individualized consciousness and one=\r\n&#39;s mind is absorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness that is not color=\r\ned by the experiences and conditioning of a single individual. One is activ=\r\nely living in the material world; one&#39;s mind is perceiving various objects =\r\nof various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind is engaging in =\r\nvarious actions in the material world though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no =\r\nindividualized conditioning or I-ness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Very very=\r\n very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can reach that=\r\n state. For most others, that state is not really a possibility.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *\n * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I gave an analogy earlie=\r\nr to explain various aspects of consciousness, using parts of a computer.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; chitta (con=\r\nditioning) - DRAM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; buddhi - ALU or logic coprocessor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; manas - I/O controller&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; jnanendriyas - input channels&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; karmendriyas - output channels&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; praanas - on-board power=\r\n supply&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deha (body) - mechanical parts, chassis etc&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Normally, CPU is running a complex program where a lot of =\r\ninput channels and output channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored dat=\r\na and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms ba=\r\nsed on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM al=\r\nl the time. This is analogous to a person&#39;s normal state.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in a pow=\r\ner standby.\n On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all input=\r\n and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU i=\r\ns not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy and exit=\r\ns it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similarly, a person =\r\nreaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previous act=\r\nivities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it will be =\r\nturned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays i=\r\nn nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman and can=\r\nnot resume previous activities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi i=\r\ns akin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program=\r\n running on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are=\r\n running on a central super computer and our individual computer&#39;s CPU simp=\r\nly has a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running o=\r\nn the\n super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. Th=\r\nere isn&#39;t much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running locall=\r\ny. One&#39;s praanas are supplying power, one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs=\r\n and one&#39;s karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling=\r\n this Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by ru=\r\nnning a small program that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all=\r\n the computers of the world and deciding what this computer should do.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said, very ver=\r\ny very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of ev=\r\nen the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa s=\r\namadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness a=\r\nfter a while and start to accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM)=\r\n. The CPU is running some program or the other, however small, and\n accumul=\r\nating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization o=\r\nf I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very diff=\r\nicult! If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I nee=\r\nd this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja sam=\r\nadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the supreme univ=\r\nersal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I =\r\ncannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business. I=\r\n will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my se=\r\nnse of dharma dictates that I should take them on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; But the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogi=\r\ns of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state =\r\nare like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me give another\n analogy. This life=\r\n is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the drea=\r\nm. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is l=\r\nike being in the dream and yet being awake.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This=\r\n may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and difficult sahaj=\r\na samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things work in a=\r\n sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\ntarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannat=\r\nh.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and how is\n it differ=\r\nent from nirvikalpa samadhi?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; best rega=\r\nrds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sr=\r\ni Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Sahaj Samadhi all times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;=\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--3--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; From cricket scores to your f=\r\nriends.
