Firstly I suggest\n&gt; using copra as it doesn&#39;t produce much smoke. S=\r\necondly, after you&#39;re\n&gt; comfortable with the homam content and fire managem=\r\nent, you will be able to\n&gt; optimize on the copra usage and reduce the smoke=\r\n further. Using camphor can\n&gt; also produce much smoke, so use it sparingly.=\r\n Ensure, you raise the window&#39;s\n&gt; a bit, so that there&#39;s circulation in the=\r\n house. However, please ensure that\n&gt; wind is not blowing in the direction =\r\nof smoke alarm, as this would cause it\n&gt; to raise the alarm. For example, o=\r\nnce I performed Ganesha Homam with windows\n&gt; close as it was very cold outs=\r\nide, by the end of it the room got stuffier,\n&gt; and when I opened the window=\r\ns a bit in both the rooms, the wind caused all\n&gt; the smoke in one direction=\r\n, passing the smoke alarm causing it to go off!\n&gt;\n&gt; Once the homam is over,=\r\n you can go ahead and place the kundam in the\n&gt; balcony, provided there&#39;s n=\r\no fire in it. So, please wait the fire to die and\n&gt; then move it outside, a=\r\ns we don&#39;t want to attract any attention. People in\n&gt; western continent are=\r\n not aware of fire rituals, and can freak out on seeing\n&gt; fire. So. when yo=\r\nu perform homam in the night, please ensure some light is\n&gt; on, otherwise i=\r\nf the lights are off, then one can see the flames from\n&gt; outside the apartm=\r\nent, causing some people to call the fire department. We\n&gt; certainly dont w=\r\nant to get into such a situation!\n&gt;\n&gt; Too much of clarified butter (ghee) c=\r\nan also cause too much smoke. The ghee\n&gt; has to be poured the right amount.=\r\n It would also help, if you could clean up\n&gt; the homa kundam so that you st=\r\nart empty. This also reduces smoke. Also\n&gt; proficiency in estimating the am=\r\nount of ghee for a size of copra to keep the\n&gt; fire going (including turnin=\r\ng at the right moment) all helps reducing the\n&gt; residual smoke effect.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nSo, with more practice you will get a better idea on all the above\n&gt; parame=\r\nters. Others may add their experience. If you have any more questions,\n&gt; pl=\r\nease feel free to ask.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, I would like to mention, that the smoke=\r\n from the homa kundam is\n&gt; very therapeutic in nature and offers a lot of b=\r\nenefits.
