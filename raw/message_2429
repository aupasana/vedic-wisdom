How can there be pleasure or removal\n=\r\nof pain so long as it continues?\n\nOnly those who need not engage in action,=\r\n are happy; they are perfectly\ncontent, and self-contained, and they experi=\r\nence a happiness which extends\nto all the pores of the body.\n\nWrongly do th=\r\ney ever engage in work, being deluded; such is the plight of\nhumanity stupe=\r\nfied by the poison of the sense of obligation.\n\nConfounding dispassion (vai=\r\nragya) with misery,and the pleasures of the world\nwith happiness (sukha), a=\r\n man suffers in the cycle of births and deaths,\nwhile powerful ignorance pr=\r\nevails.\n\nAssociation with the Sages is alone said to lead to the highest go=\r\nod. Your\ncontact with Samvarta has led you to this stage of enlightenment, =\r\nwhich is\nthe forerunner of emancipation. On being approached, the Sages tea=\r\nch the\ngreatest good.\n\nMisery is of two kinds, external and internal.The fo=\r\nrmer pertains to the\nbody and is caused by the nerves, etc.; the latter per=\r\ntains to the mind and\nis caused by desire.\n\nMental distraction is worse tha=\r\nn physical pain and the whole world has\nfallen a victim to it. Desire is th=\r\ne seed of the tree of misery and never\nfails in its fruits.\n\nRespite gained=\r\n by the fulfilment of one desire before another takes its\nplace, is not hap=\r\npiness, because the seeds of pain are still latent. Such\nrespite is enjoyed=\r\n by the insects also (which certainly do not typify\nperfect happiness).Yet =\r\nis their enjoyment distinctly better than that of men\nbecause their desires=\r\n are less complex?\n\nFatigue is certainly produced for everybody after the f=\r\nlurry (or passion) of\ncopulation, just as there is fatigue for an animal ca=\r\nrrying a load\n\nBeauty is only a mental concept, as is evident from the simi=\r\nlar feeling in\nsimilar enjoyments of lovers in dreams.\n\nThe idea of beauty =\r\nlies in one=92s own desire innate in the mind.\n\nEven the most accomplished =\r\namong men have fallen into the habit of seeking\npleasure from woman, for al=\r\nl consider her the best hunting ground for\ndelight.Similarly also a man=92s=\r\n body is thought by women to be the highest\nsource of enjoyment.Shaped of f=\r\nat and flesh, filled with blood,topped by the\nhead, covered by skin, ribbed=\r\n by bones,covered with hair, containing bile\nand phlegm, a pitcher of faece=\r\ns and urine, generated from semen and ovum,\nand born from the opening from =\r\nwhere urine is ejected =97 such is the body.\nJust think of it! Finding deli=\r\nght in such a thing, how are men any better\nthan worms growing in offal?\n\nW=\r\nhat is known as the mind is, after all, always like a restless monkey. So\nt=\r\nhe ordinary man is always afflicted with troubles. Everybody knows that a\nr=\r\nestless mind is the channel of endless troubles; whereas one is happy in\nsl=\r\neep in the absence of such restlessness.Hearing with a distracted mind is\na=\r\ns good as not hearing, for the words serve no useful purpose, resembling\nth=\r\ne fruit-laden tree seen in a painting.\n\nMen earn their food, gods their nec=\r\ntar, pious ascetics the highest beatitude\nand others their desires, by indi=\r\nvidual exertion alone.\n\nWhatever has the impress of misery on it cannot be =\r\ngood. Such are wealth,\nchildren, wife, kingdom, treasury, army, fame, learn=\r\ning, intellect, body,\nbeauty and prosperity. For they are all transient and=\r\n already in the jaws of\ndeath, otherwise called time.\n\nTherefore worship th=\r\ne Primal Cause of the universe as the starting point; be\ndevoted to Him; He=\r\n will soon enable you to succeed in your attempts to\ndestroy the illusion.\n=\r\n\nAmong the methods of approach to God, there are (1) worship to overcome\ntr=\r\noubles, (2) worship to gain wealth, etc., and (3) loving dedication of\nones=\r\nelf. The last one is the best and surest in its results.\n\nA human master ma=\r\ny take long to recognise unselfish work;but God, the Lord\nof the Universe, =\r\nthe Dweller in our hearts, knows everything and soon\nbestows appropriate fr=\r\nuits. In the case of other kinds of devotees, God has\nto await the course o=\r\nf destiny =97 that being His own ordainment; whereas for\nthe selfless devot=\r\nee, God, the\nLord and the sole refuge, is all in all and takes care of him =\r\nwithout\nreference to the devotee=92s predestiny or His own ordained laws. H=\r\ne\ncompensates the devotee quickly, and that is because He is supreme and\nse=\r\nlf-contained without depending on anything else.\n\nPredestiny or divine will=\r\n is powerless before Him. Everyone knows how He set\naside predestiny and di=\r\nvine laws in the case of His famous devotee,\nMarkandeya.\n\n[Note: A Rishi, M=\r\nrikandu by name, who was childless,pleased Siva by his\npenance. When Siva a=\r\nppeared to him,he prayed that a son might be born to\nhim. Siva asked him if=\r\n he wished to have a dull boy long-lived, or a bright\nboy short-lived. Mrik=\r\nandu preferred the latter. So Siva said =91You will have\na very brilliant s=\r\non; but he will only live for sixteen years=92. Accordingly\na son was born =\r\nwho was very good and dutiful, and most intelligent and\npious,charming all =\r\nwho saw him. The parents were delighted with him but grew\nsad as he grew up=\r\n. He asked them the reason for their sadness and they told\nhim of Siva=92s =\r\nboon.He said, =91Never mind. I will see=92, and took to\npenance.Siva was pl=\r\neased with his intense devotion and ordained that he\nshould remain sixteen =\r\nyears of age for all eternity.]\n\nThe current notion that one cannot escape =\r\none=92s destiny is applicable only\nto weak-minded and senseless wastrels.\n\n=\r\nThe Primal Being is Siva with five faces and three eyes, the Creator would\n=\r\nin that case be like an ordinary potter making pots, endowed with a body an=\r\nd\nbrain. True, there is no art found in the world, without a body and some\n=\r\nintellect. In fact, the creative faculty in men belongs to something betwee=\r\nn\nthe body and pure intelligence.\n\n[Note: Body being insentient cannot act =\r\nof its own accord; nor can intellect\ndo so without a tool.]\n\nTherefore the =\r\nmind operates apart from the gross body,in dreams; being\nintelligent it cre=\r\nates an environment suitable to its latent desires. This\nclearly indicates =\r\nthat the body is only a tool for a purpose and the agent\nis intelligence.In=\r\nstruments are necessary for human agents because their\ncapacities are limit=\r\ned and they are not self-contained.Whereas the Creator\nof the universe is p=\r\nerfect in Himself and creates the whole universe without\nany external aid.T=\r\nhis leads to the important conclusion that God has no\nbody.Otherwise, He wo=\r\nuld be reduced to a glorified human being, requiring\ninnumerable accessorie=\r\ns for work and influenced by seasons and environments,\nin no way different =\r\nfrom a creature, and not the Lord. Moreover,\npreexistence of accessories wo=\r\nuld quash His unique mastery and imply limits\nto His powers of creation. Th=\r\nis is absurd, as being contrary to the original\npremises. Therefore, He has=\r\n no body nor the other aids, yet He still creates\nthe world, O Lord of my l=\r\nife! Fools are taken in by the notion of giving a\nbody to the transcendenta=\r\nl Being. Still, if devotees worship and contemplate\nHim with a body accordi=\r\nng to their own inclinations, He shows them grace,\nassuming such a body. Fo=\r\nr He is unique and fulfils the desires of His\ndevotees.\n\nNevertheless, the =\r\nconclusion must be reached that He is pure intelligence\nand His consciousne=\r\nss is absolute and transcendental.Such is the\nconsciousness-intelligence in=\r\n purity,Absolute Being, the One Queen,\nParameswari (Transcendental Goddess)=\r\n, overwhelming the three states and\nhence called Tripura. Though She is the=\r\n undivided whole, the universe\nmanifests in all its variety in Her, being r=\r\neflected as it were,in a\nself-luminous mirror. The reflection cannot be apa=\r\nrt from the mirror and is\ntherefore one with it. Such being the case, there=\r\n cannot be difference in\ndegrees (e.g., Siva, or Vishnu being superior to e=\r\nach other). Bodies are\nmere conceptions in the lower order of beings and th=\r\ney are not to the point\nin the case of God. Therefore, be wise,and worship =\r\nthe one pure, unblemished\nTranscendence.\n\nAs long as you are contaminated w=\r\nith notions of me or mine (e.g., my home,\nmy body, my mind, my intellect),t=\r\nhe Self will not be found, for it lies\nbeyond cognition and cannot be reali=\r\nsed as =91my Self =92.\n\nRetire into solitude, analyse and see what those th=\r\nings are which are\ncognised as mine; discard them all and transcending them=\r\n, look for the Real\nSelf.\n\nIs there any moment when the Self is not the Sel=\r\nf? Neither is control of\nmind used to gain it. I shall give you some exampl=\r\nes:\n\nJust as things unseen in darkness are found on its removal by means of=\r\n a\nlamp, and are therefore said to be recovered from oblivion.\n\nJust as a c=\r\nonfused man forgets his purse, but remembers and locates it on\nkeeping his =\r\nmind unruffled and steady, yet still says that he has gained the\nlost purse=\r\n,though the steadying of his mind did not produce it.\n\nSo also the control =\r\nof your mind is not the cause of your Self-realisation;\nthough the Self is =\r\nalways there, it is not recognised by you even with a\ncontrolled mind becau=\r\nse you are not conversant with it.\n\nJust as an infant tries to take hold of=\r\n his own reflection being unaware of\nthe mirror, so also common people are =\r\ntaken in by their mental reflections\nin the mirror of the pure, luminous Se=\r\nlf and are not aware of the mirror,\nbecause they have no acquaintance with =\r\nthe Self.\n\nThe mind should be brought to the condition of a newborn baby.Th=\r\nen he feels\nas if he were separate from all gross materials and only the fe=\r\neling =91I am=92\npersists.\n\nSource: TRIPURA RAHASYA OR THE MYSTERY BEYOND T=\r\nHE TRINITY Translated by\nSWAMI SRI RAMANANANDA SARASWATHI (Munagala S.
