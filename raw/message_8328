Also if by some chance, you =\r\ntravel to these remote parts (Norforlk), do let me know! \n\nIn the meantime,=\r\n it would be good to speak on the phone if you&#39;re willing. I&#39;d be intereste=\r\nd to know about your homam practice so far, and your experiences with it.  =\r\nIt&#39;s great to hear that you live locally and also do this practice.

I\n&gt; did a bit last year=\r\n, then stopped and started again last week. I know the\n&gt; best motivator is =\r\none&#39;s own personal experience by doing the practice and I\n&gt; intend to do ho=\r\nmams regularly- well, at least once in two weeks at present\n&gt; (given my wor=\r\nk schedule as a trainee doctor). \n&gt; \n&gt; However, in the meantime, it would h=\r\nelp to hear about others&#39; positive\n&gt; experiences with their practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nDo people feel that their homam practice brings more peace, happiness in\n&gt; =\r\ntheir lives? \n&gt; \n&gt; I live in the UK and there is nobody in the city where I=\r\n live to talk to\n&gt; about homams so it is pretty lonely, and quite hard to g=\r\net motivated. My\n&gt; family are supportive of me in many ways, but not really=\r\n interested when it\n&gt; comes to homams/japa etc...they are quite amused/bemu=\r\nsed by it all and\n&gt; tolerate it politely. \n&gt; \n&gt; Any ladies/people living in=\r\n the UK who are interested in starting a\n&gt; homam-at-home group to motivate/=\r\nsupport each other? (There must be at least\n&gt; one other woman in the UK who=\r\n&#39;s in this group and interested in\n&gt; homams...please email me!) I&#39;m delight=\r\ned that women are allowed to do\n&gt; homams....it would be great to have a gro=\r\nup to support each other (I&#39;m sure\n&gt; this is a long shot, but it&#39;s worth as=\r\nking). \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
