It was a strong resolve, but wavering in between, in the last 24 hou=\r\nrs that I shopped yes&#39;day evening and started today.\n\nBut again, thanks for=\r\n all your answers. \n\nregards\nrAma\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Aji=\r\nt Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Congratulations on =\r\nyour first homam !\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m able to repeat answers to some of your question=\r\ns only because they\n&gt; have come up in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Partially burnt po=\r\nornahuti / ahutis -- leave it in the homa kundam\n&gt; so that it finishes burn=\r\ning in the next homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Ashes / Cleaning the kunda -- you can leave=\r\n it in the homa kunda,\n&gt; or clean it. It is a tradeoff ... if you want less=\r\n smoke, it is better\n&gt; to clean it, but there are also likely to be some pa=\r\nrtially burnt\n&gt; particles in the ash. If you leave it, some small partially=\r\n burnt\n&gt; particles may finish burning, but there is likely to be a little m=\r\nore\n&gt; smoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Disposing of ashes. As Narasimha has written, you wan=\r\nt to\n&gt; distribute the energy in the ashes back to nature in a respectful wa=\r\ny.\n&gt; Do whatever is possible given your constraints. If no other\n&gt; alternat=\r\nive presents itself, throw them out in the garbage.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) Twigs & Ghee -=\r\n- The twigs are dipped in ghee before they are\n&gt; offered. After that you of=\r\nfer ghee ahutis to the fire (and thus, the\n&gt; twigs) until they burn.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\n5) Copper vs Iron -- Narasimha has told us that iron is unlikely to\n&gt; have =\r\na good mix of gunas, and copper is a much better choice. If you\n&gt; have to g=\r\net a new kunda, why not get a copper one?\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) Size -- The size of the =\r\nhoma kinda is a matter of preference based\n&gt; on the size of the fire that y=\r\nou light. With a smaller kunda, you may\n&gt; have trouble  exposing all sides =\r\nof all ahutis to air, which might\n&gt; prevent them from burning well. With a =\r\nlarger kunda, if you don&#39;t keep\n&gt; an equivalently large fire ablaze, you ma=\r\ny have more smoke. Once you\n&gt; do homam repeatedly, you will figure out if y=\r\nou need (or want) a kunda\n&gt; of a different size.\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) Washing & Cleanin=\r\ng -- You do not have to wash the kunda daily\n&gt; (though you can if you choos=\r\ne to). It is a good idea to keep the\n&gt; prayer area relatively clean ... you=\r\n should be comfortable with it.\n&gt; Using something like aluminum foil can ma=\r\nke regular cleanup easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; (8) Bali -- After puja, bali is offered to an=\r\nimals, and is not\n&gt; consumed by us. If this is not possible, you can throw =\r\nit out.\n&gt; \n&gt; (9) Base of the kunda -- Putting the kunda on newspaper is a b=\r\nad idea\n&gt; ... it may easily catch on fire. A wooden plank may work, though =\r\nit is\n&gt; better if it is raised (i.e. has a gap of air between the main plan=\r\nk\n&gt; and the ground). Even with a wooden plank, two bricks between the\n&gt; pla=\r\nnk and kunda is a good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you have extra free time, consider s=\r\nearching the group archives\n&gt; for these same questions. You&#39;ll come across =\r\nmany other interesting\n&gt; points from previous discussions on the same topic=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 =A0ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Jun 24=\r\n, 2011 at 11:45 PM, Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Oh ! and lastly, wh=\r\nat do I do with the &quot;bali&quot; fruit pieces ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Also, I bought a metal homa kund (not copper, probably iron), 6x6 inches=\r\n in the interior and probably a sq.ft exterior. I am thinking now it is too=\r\n big if I want to start daily homams.

If I cannot use br=\r\nicks, can I just place the copper kund on a wooden plank or newspaper piece=\r\n !\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, do we need to wash and clean the homa kund, the wooden ladle =\r\nand the whole prayer area daily ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rAma\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sh Narasimha, et al. - I have done my first homam (SriKrsna hom=\r\nam) today, hopefully it was fine, as I made some minor mistakes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Fir=\r\nst of all, the fire got put off twice, as the twigs did not catch fire easi=\r\nly. I learnt that the twigs need to be cut vertically for them to burn bett=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Secondly, the full dry coconut did not burn completely in the po=\r\nornahuti and if I put a half one or a piece it would have burnt completely.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Also, the dharbhas I have were a bit bent and I could not put them =\r\npointed to north or south or the other directions correctly. Hope that was =\r\nok too !\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now some questions (I am sure these have been answer=\r\ned, I apologize, but would appreciate if you respond again); btw, if these =\r\ncould be put in FAQ, will be much obliged.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. what do I do with the =\r\npartially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use it tomorrow ? Also, what does one do=\r\n with all the ash and the burnt part? What is the holy way to dispose it of=\r\nf ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! Do I put them under a tree and pour=\r\n water ? Not many trees, only plants, in the apts I live here.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If=\r\n there are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use them again? Or do they =\r\nneed to be disposed off ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Is it advisable to dip (not pour) the t=\r\nwigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let me know of othe=\r\nr points I might have known for a beginner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, a millio=\r\nn thanks and appreciations for all who are responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc=\r\n.) for the KT.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
