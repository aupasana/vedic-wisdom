However, water cools it. Rishis did \nGayatri mantra while standing in river water. That is a great way to do \nGayatri. Some people like Vimalananda actually recommend sitting in a tub of \nwater when doing an intensive Gayatri japam.\n\nI can personally attest that intensive and focused chanting of Gayatri \nmantra generates tremendous heat inside. There was a day when I sat the \nwhole day and did Gayatri mantra from 5 am till 9:30 pm. I felt extremely \nlight and tremendously hot at the end of it. It is not because of sitting \nfor too long and Gayatri mantra IS a factor. For example, when I chanted \nDevi Sooktam from 5 am till 11 pm on another occasion, that heat was \nmissing. Even when I spent 5 am-9 pm doing Chandi homam continuously for 2 \nconsecutive days (i.e. sitting in front of fire continuously), I did not \nfeel that kind of heat. Intensive chanting of Gayatri mantra definitely \nproduces heat inside.\n\nHowever, I do not think that that means contact with water is bad. On the \ncontrary, contact with cool things in the gross and subtle planes balances \nthat heat. My recommendation is: Feel free to chant Gayatri mantra while \nimmersed in water.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Harihara Krishnan&quot; &lt;harih2002@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 09, 2009 3:54 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantras, Kavachas and Stotras\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram. Thank you for your quick reply to my query. I am encouraged to \n&gt; ask more of the questions troubling me from time to time. Please bear with \n&gt; me.\n&gt;\n&gt; While reading Devi Bhagavatham I came across a passage which states that \n&gt; since Gayatri is AgniMukhi, one should not recite the holy Gayatri mantram \n&gt; while immersed in water. However I have come across the sayings of \n&gt; Bhagavan Sathya Sai Baba wherein he mentions the time of bathing as most \n&gt; suited for chanting the holy Gayatri mantram. Can both suggestions be true \n&gt; at the same time?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Hari\n\n\n"}}
