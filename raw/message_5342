Human body is naturally suited for an omnivo=\r\nrous diet. Just like \n&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not=\r\n eat raw vegetables as well. \n&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human societ=\r\ny. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and lo=\r\nok at REAL \n&gt; research in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scie=\r\nntific papers in \n&gt; clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 jun=\r\ne/july, you would find \n&gt; ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for man=\r\ny milleniums have relied on an \n&gt; omnivorous diet:-\n&gt; \n&gt; a) Human ancestral=\r\n diets changed substantially approximately four to five \n&gt; million years ag=\r\no with major climatic changes creating open grassland \n&gt; environments. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler \n&gt; g=\r\nastrointestinal tract=C3=82=C2=A0 requiring=C3=82=C2=A0foods based around m=\r\neat protein and fat. For \n&gt; example since the time of Australopithecus afar=\r\nensis, some four to five million \n&gt; years ago, brain size has increased thr=\r\neefold - chemical requirement for \n&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid =\r\nchains in the brain - without a \n&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Meta=\r\nbolic Rate. This is possible only with a \n&gt; diet that is rich is animal pro=\r\ntein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain \n&gt; would not have reached the =\r\nsize and mass as it is today, had it not been for \n&gt; diet comprising of mea=\r\nt, fruits and vegetables. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; c) The gut morphology of the human body =\r\nas it stand todays is ideally \n&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as wel=\r\nl as herbivores. That is because \n&gt; humans are designed to be omnivores. Th=\r\ne lack of a well developed caecum and \n&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it=\r\n difficult for the body to absorve plant \n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, w=\r\nhich is why, a=C3=82=C2=A0major part of the leafy vegetable \n&gt; based diet e=\r\nventually ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining \n&gt; of =\r\nhumans do not contain=C3=82=C2=A0 the kind of strong acids which is present=\r\n in a typical \n&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature =\r\nthrough=C3=82=C2=A0 the natural \n&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be o=\r\nmnivorous. It may further interest you \n&gt; to know that the teeth structure =\r\nof humans is actually identical to, guess what, \n&gt; rats who also are omnivo=\r\nres.\n&gt; \n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0research into \n&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that absor=\r\nption ability of the human \n&gt; body for=C3=82=C2=A0w.r.t different foods=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, \n&gt; and lowest for =\r\nred meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered negative \n&gt; calorie fo=\r\nod, since it requires the body to waste more calories in absorving it \n&gt; th=\r\nan the amount it gains from them.

Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just li=\r\nke &lt;BR&gt;&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw veg=\r\netables as well. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human society. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved =\r\nideas and look at REAL &lt;BR&gt;&gt; research in the most unbiased way possible,=\r\n and accessed scientific papers in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; clinical nutrition and dietetic=\r\ns, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ample evidence tha=\r\nt humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; omni=\r\nvorous diet:-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substantial=\r\nly approximately four to five &lt;BR&gt;&gt; million years ago with major climati=\r\nc changes creating open grassland &lt;BR&gt;&gt; environments. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82&nbsp; requiring=C3=82&nbsp;foods base=\r\nd around meat protein and fat. For &lt;BR&gt;&gt; example since the time of Austr=\r\nalopithecus afarensis, some four to five million &lt;BR&gt;&gt; years ago, brain =\r\nsize has increased threefold - chemical requirement for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; long-chain=\r\n polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; corres=\r\nponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with a =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, =\r\nour brain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would not have reached the\n size and mass as it is today=\r\n, had it not been for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetabl=\r\nes. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; c) The gut morphology of the human body as i=\r\nt stand todays is ideally &lt;BR&gt;&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as w=\r\nell as herbivores. That is because &lt;BR&gt;&gt; humans are designed to be omniv=\r\nores. The lack of a well developed caecum and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rumen, unlike herbiv=\r\nores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cellulose i=\r\nnto usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82&nbsp;major part of the leafy veget=\r\nable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other hand,=\r\n the stomach lining &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82&nbsp; the kind =\r\nof strong acids which is present in a typical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; carnivore. This is b=\r\necause, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82&nbsp; the natural &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may further inter=\r\nest you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to know that the teeth structure\n of humans is actually id=\r\nentical to, guess what, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rats who also are omnivores.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\nresearch into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that absor=\r\nption ability of the human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; body for=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t different foo=\r\nds=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and =\r\nlowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered negative &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calories in a=\r\nbsorving it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the ea=\r\nsiet to digest. You can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; look up actual BV (biological value)=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;charts for more details.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; All this is science.
