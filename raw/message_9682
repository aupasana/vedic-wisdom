Here is\n&gt;&gt; a simple description of what&#39;s involved.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First, approach the house with auspicious items, and enter it with a lit\n&gt;&gt; fire (eg. lamp). This fire is then established in the house. Next, a big\n&gt;&gt; pot of water is filled with water, and a vastu homam is performed. After\n&gt;&gt; the homam, the house is sprinkled inside and out with the water from the\n&gt;&gt; pot.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In South India, after entering the house, the first thing that is done is\n&gt;&gt; to boil some milk on the stove. Some people specifically ensure that the\n&gt;&gt; milk boils over and a little falls out of the pot. One of the books I\n&gt;&gt; consulted has a nice prescription -- &quot;anyasmAt pachanAt pUrvam gRhamadhye\n&gt;&gt; carum pacet&quot;. Before any normal cooking happens in the house, first cook\n&gt;&gt; the &#39;caru&#39; in the homa fire, and offer it to the fire. In olden days, there\n&gt;&gt; was no stove, and all cooking was also done on a fire. Some people had a\n&gt;&gt; separate fire for cooking and homam. Others had a single fire in which they\n&gt;&gt; cooked and did homam. As part of the griha pravesha homa, they cooked\n&gt;&gt; something first in the homa fire (same as cooking fire), and offered some\n&gt;&gt; of it into the fire. It is entirely possible that this became simplified\n&gt;&gt; and the tradition of cooking the caru and offering it into the fire turned\n&gt;&gt; into heating some milk on the stove and then letting it spill on top of the\n&gt;&gt; stove !\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here is a simple procedure that tries to retain the spirit of the\n&gt;&gt; &quot;rules&quot;. Enter the house with a lamp. Put it where you want to do your\n&gt;&gt; regular homam, and establish a kalasha nearby. As part of your naivedya,\n&gt;&gt; keep some milk in a small pot as close to the homa kunda as possible (so\n&gt;&gt; that it can absorb the heat and get &quot;cooked&quot;). Do your regular homa. If you\n&gt;&gt; know how, offer some ahutis with the mantras for vatoshpati. When you do\n&gt;&gt; the naivedya, offer a little of the milk into the fire (if and only if your\n&gt;&gt; fire is big enough so that it won&#39;t get extinguished). After the homam is\n&gt;&gt; over, take the water and sprinkle it all over the house. Drink the milk as\n&gt;&gt; the prasadam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; sasneham,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     ajit\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--089e0158cb9299b1a304e4d2144a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear Sri Bhat,&lt;br&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_ext=\r\nra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&gt;=A0i need to know how to take =\r\nthe soil samples from the site and use it during my regular homams&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry ...
