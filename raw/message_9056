But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises fr=\r\nom non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, s=\r\nuch as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in oth=\r\ner words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or t=\r\nhe result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. \n&gt;\n&gt;However=\r\n most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; pat=\r\nients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend t=\r\no be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my hea=\r\nd&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. \n&gt;\n&gt;About vata, most of our patients=\r\n have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable to s=\r\nleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try an=\r\nd help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannabis =\r\nand other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this does no good for =\r\nvata.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on her beh=\r\nalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient. \n&gt;\n&gt;C=\r\nan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini patient? M=\r\nost doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and will advise anti-ps=\r\nychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm them, th=\r\nough I doubt it will help.\n&gt;\n&gt;Advice and thoughts from all members would be=\r\n much appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;Om Dum Durgayai Namaha\n&gt;\n&gt;Aparna\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

You are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of e=\r\nnjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(when looked at by an exter=\r\nnal observer). However the internal joy of Kundalini is something which fil=\r\nls that saint so completely that some great ones were completely unaware of=\r\n their external problems.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts =\r\nthe external world to sleep.I sometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a ba=\r\nby being thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremend=\r\nous because the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t =\r\ndo anything without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The prob=\r\nlem with adults is that they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of =\r\nego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painless process unlike th=\r\nat of the baby.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges&quot; of =\r\nenergy may=C2=A0result=C2=A0in mental havoc.=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, =\r\nmany people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of japa=\r\n. Japa which deals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can cause =\r\nserious instability in these people.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Some=C2=A0of the=C2=A0people who h=\r\nave Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a s=\r\ningle worthwhile thing in their lives and think that the faking of Kundalin=\r\ni rises may help them get some esteem in the eye of the general public.=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, for any doctor, the sepa=\r\nration of the true from the false claims must precede any attempt at helpin=\r\ng the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tend=\r\ns to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, tr=\r\navel.=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all=C2=A0that must be regimentalised, then =\r\nappropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. A=\r\npplication of oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppos=\r\ne even Shiro basti in difficult real cases may be useful.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Then institut=\r\ne small=C2=A0Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by t=\r\nhe patient. That should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of t=\r\nhe Muladhara.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two years.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, M=\r\narch 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience what sounds l=\r\nike a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be one.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It mus=\r\nt be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various na=\r\ndis without one having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. f=\r\nine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and development of detachment) CAN create havo=\r\nc!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in =\r\na layman with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is jus=\r\nt A SMALL\n&gt;&gt; STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapida=\r\nted house (this\n&gt;&gt; body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may =\r\nfirst construct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. =\r\nAlternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under c=\r\nonstruction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is=\r\n it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is sa=\r\nfer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards comple=\r\nte Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not my w=\r\nord&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Second=\r\nly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient ef=\r\nfort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous=\r\n life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it no=\r\nw. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it=\r\n comes in this life.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy t=\r\noo many specific\n&gt;&gt; desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your =\r\ndesires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, aris=\r\ning from YOUR\n&gt;&gt; OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what =\r\nyou want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For examp=\r\nle, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich bu=\r\nt very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole =\r\nlife for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not h=\r\nave any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt;&gt; case, one may deeply desire to a=\r\nct in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in a=\r\n famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt;&gt; experience. Basically, people k=\r\neep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they=\r\n are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one d=\r\neeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one=\r\n&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be bo=\r\nrn in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is=\r\n enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is w=\r\nell-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I s=\r\naw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so b=\r\nadly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow =\r\ndeath and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like =\r\nthat chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and sc=\r\nared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If our id=\r\neas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and=\r\n if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realizati=\r\non of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, wi=\r\nthout being scared?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kunda=\r\nlini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better th=\r\nan\n&gt;&gt; Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is st=\r\nill left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problema=\r\ntic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay bur=\r\nied deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If o=\r\nne overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one=\r\n&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor=\r\n, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme exampl=\r\ne, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues th=\r\ne world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the=\r\n world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to an=\r\ny such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progre=\r\nss and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awa=\r\nkened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate on=\r\ne&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and =\r\nspiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The b=\r\nest approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise=\r\n. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n&gt;&gt; weaknesses and improve your detachment =\r\nover time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or dis=\r\ntaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin =\r\nof attachment. It is a negative attachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t wo=\r\nrry about \n&gt;&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you =\r\nare able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pas=\r\nhas) or \n&gt;&gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are maki=\r\nng progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making pr=\r\nogress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to =\r\na personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have=\r\n it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be offended by my =\r\nwords, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will =\r\npray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I wi=\r\nll pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. T=\r\nhere is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no pl=\r\nace for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing=\r\n oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is =\r\naccepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or high=\r\nly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is=\r\n thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and d=\r\nuring) Death.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many =\r\ndesires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be tr=\r\napped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want=\r\n to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering.=\r\n If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was t=\r\nrying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes=\r\n one *run away* from God&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a co=\r\nnditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or=\r\n surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is tem=\r\nporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doin=\r\ng your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment an=\r\nd a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can p=\r\nrotect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning a=\r\nnd impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness=\r\n) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how=\r\n light your conditioning is.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;_____________=\r\n___________________\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;mailto:vedic-wisd=\r\nom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: T=\r\nhursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundal=\r\nini syndrome\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 ,=\r\n perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=\r\n=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of th=\r\ne hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal=\r\n deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes=\r\n who play havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protect=\r\nion of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitel=\r\ny=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the vari=\r\nous elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words t=\r\nhis translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness=\r\n, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalin=\r\ni awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with grea=\r\nter force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then tak=\r\nes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens =\r\n- IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to var=\r\nious other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whi=\r\nle some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the in=\r\ndividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=\r\nr and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=\r\ns even more\n&gt;&gt; vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an=\r\n experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies o=\r\nf psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by wes=\r\nt today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also=\r\n possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from =\r\nvarious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, ca=\r\nn get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lif=\r\nestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside =\r\nthe mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these ar=\r\ne very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to li=\r\nst down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done,=\r\n very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who c=\r\nlaim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess=\r\n work.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to b=\r\ne achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the anci=\r\nent Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |par=\r\nam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From:=\r\n sunrise_1080 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sen=\r\nt: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundal=\r\nini syndrome\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn pe=\r\nople of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mi=\r\nne. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the c=\r\nare of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of th=\r\neir kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences an=\r\nd surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never h=\r\neard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explan=\r\nation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (al=\r\nl tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Man=\r\ny people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual cri=\r\nsis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered intere=\r\nst and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately the=\r\nse patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no =\r\ntreatments for deranged\n&gt;&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis =\r\ntry to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed=\r\n my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants=\r\n to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is=\r\n so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot esca=\r\npe from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logica=\r\nl one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to r=\r\nelieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the st=\r\nrength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray =\r\nfor her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering=\r\n really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end =\r\nup in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the=\r\n safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave =\r\nthe kundalini\n&gt;&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.

But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini =\r\nrises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experi=\r\nences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience=\r\n- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinati=\r\nons or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seekin=\r\ng &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their st=\r\nories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voic=\r\nes in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;About vata, most=\r\n of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usu=\r\nally unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derang=\r\nement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The =\r\nuse of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m\n sure this =\r\ndoes no good for vata.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I wi=\r\nll do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this =\r\nto any patient. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in=\r\n the kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis=\r\n&quot; and will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope th=\r\nis will not harm them, though I doubt it will help.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Advice and thoug=\r\nhts from all members would be much appreciated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Om Dum Durgayai Nama=\r\nha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Aparna&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you=\r\n. in actual fact, that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited =\r\nyou&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;However,&nbsp;the hold of=\r\n the I ness on everything is so tremendous that its difficult to let go eno=\r\nugh that you can allow this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors who see these &quot;p=\r\natients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because they are conditioned to think =\r\nin words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God completely anyw=\r\nay.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This,&nbsp;combined with the fact that for&nbsp;most people, Ku=\r\nndalini is not wanted because these\n people&nbsp;want the objects which God=\r\n can give, not God Herself, means that the scope for misunderstanding is tr=\r\nemendous.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but most are unable to real=\r\nise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely to s=\r\nee even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of =\r\nmisery(when looked at by an external observer). However the internal joy of=\r\n Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely that some grea=\r\nt ones were completely unaware of their external problems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;When=\r\n Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I some=\r\ntimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by the =\r\nparent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender i=\r\ns complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so =\r\nit&#39;s feeling is that of\n joy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that t=\r\nhey have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother =\r\ntakes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;r=\r\nesult&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Sec=\r\nondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept =\r\nof japa. Japa which deals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can=\r\n cause serious instability in these people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nb=\r\nsp;people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they h=\r\naven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and think that the fak=\r\ning of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the eye of the gene=\r\nral public.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, fo=\r\nr any doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must precede=\r\n any attempt at\n helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to=\r\n finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping hab=\r\nits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp;tha=\r\nt must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is =\r\nessential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totally ca=\r\nlm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases m=\r\nay be useful.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati a=\r\nnd the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should really impro=\r\nve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole =\r\nprocess may be chalked out over one-two years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non real=\r\n cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nJai Shree Rama&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha=\r\n P.V.R.\n Rao wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience=\r\n what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that Kundalini spo=\r\nntaneously rising through various nadis without one having gone through pro=\r\nper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and develo=\r\npment of detachment) CAN create havoc!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no =\r\nsadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement.

In fact, it comes=\r\n with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Simi=\r\nlarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any out o=\r\nf body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words=\r\n to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does no=\r\nt get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it=\r\n. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may h=\r\nave put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may =\r\nbe unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this =\r\nlife.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try\n not to=\r\n fancy too many specific&lt;BR&gt;&gt; desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in g=\r\nranting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you ri=\r\nght now, arising from YOUR&lt;BR&gt;&gt; OWN previous actions). So Nature sometim=\r\nes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want somethi=\r\nng else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be=\r\n born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that weal=\r\nth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very =\r\nhealthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another &lt;BR&gt;&gt; case, one=\r\n may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as a=\r\n tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; experience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives=\r\n, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply\n desires an ou=\r\nt of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas =\r\nconstrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life wit=\r\nh this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik forc=\r\ne behind it).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily s=\r\ncary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachmen=\r\nt.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a =\r\nmouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake=\r\n violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared t=\r\nhat I would kill it!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like tha=\r\nt chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scare=\r\nd of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind comple=\r\nx) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t =\r\na complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this b=\r\nody-mind complex, without being scared?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise af=\r\nter most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; K=\r\nundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still lef=\r\nt in one&#39;s system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcen=\r\nds one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another noti=\r\non that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and to=\r\nrment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be anothe=\r\nr notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s\n awareness clings on to (e.g=\r\n. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As a=\r\nn extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great sou=\r\nl who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who=\r\n will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) dee=\r\nply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some=\r\n signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with unde=\r\nsirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heav=\r\nily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and it=\r\ns rise. Just do sadhana, overcome\n your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; weaknesses and improve your=\r\n detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not di=\r\nsgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other s=\r\nide of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; whether you=\r\nr Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 inte=\r\nrnal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not. If =\r\nyour ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF=\r\n your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you com=\r\npletely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will automa=\r\ntically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nOne word on surrendering to\n a personal deity. Though true surrender is hel=\r\npful, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though =\r\npeople may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please g=\r\nive it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and pleas=\r\ne protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you wa=\r\nnt and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires=\r\n, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascin=\r\nation for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord =\r\nthrows one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s pr=\r\nasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with f=\r\nascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many de=\r\nsires and wrong\n notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be tra=\r\npped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want =\r\nto &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. =\r\nIf you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was tr=\r\nying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes =\r\none *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to =\r\na conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispass=\r\nion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken awa=\r\ny anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepare=\r\nd to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental condi=\r\ntioning\n (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundal=\r\nini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nad=\r\nis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meetin=\r\ng True Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how lig=\r\nht your conditioning is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regard=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Astro=\r\nlogy &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymail=\r\nto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/A&gt;&quot; &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursda=\r\ny, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Kundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly =\r\ncorrect&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes =\r\nthe ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and ma=\r\nnthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play hav=\r\noc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are under the protection of&nbsp; =\r\na mahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wi=\r\nped off .

Constant efforts of purificat=\r\nion of the various elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In =\r\nsimpler words this\n translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more =\r\nnon-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a =\r\ngenuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the =\r\nDevata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The=\r\n Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As=\r\n Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind=\r\n and body to various other things and entities, some of which are not posti=\r\nve in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a chance can ma=\r\nke use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weak=\r\nness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhu=\r\nta-suddhi becomes even more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vital. 4 - While someday or other every=\r\n sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising u=\r\np, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psychology=\r\n as\n understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with vari=\r\nous things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, w=\r\nhich protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remain as f=\r\nunctional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress,=\r\n or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of va=\r\nrious entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing serious hav=\r\noc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are there, it=\r\n is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagno=\r\nsis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the=\r\n situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more tha=\r\nn an intelligent guess work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sometimes it will have results, someti=\r\nmes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind i=\r\nn a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore\n s=\r\nano. -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah =\r\n|param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent=\r\n: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of =\r\nkundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am=\r\n doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of s=\r\nomeone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their\n kun=\r\ndalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surge=\r\ns of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of=\r\n kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. =\r\nWe have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests=\r\n normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many peopl=\r\ne we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or=\r\n unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and =\r\nresearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these pati=\r\nents are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatme=\r\nnts for deranged&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis tr=\r\ny to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed m=\r\ny feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants t=\r\no kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged\n energy is =\r\nso bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escap=\r\ne from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical=\r\n one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to re=\r\nlieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the str=\r\nength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray f=\r\nor her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering =\r\nreally is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end u=\r\np in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the =\r\nsafest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave t=\r\nhe kundalini&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.
