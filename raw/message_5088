Samadhi literall=\r\ny means\n&gt; concentration and focus of awareness. In its normal state, mind i=\r\ns\n&gt; vibrating with too many thoughts and notions. In any state of samadhi,\n=\r\n&gt; most of these thoughts and notions disappear and mind achieves a high\n&gt; d=\r\negree of focus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The focus can be on a physical object perceived thr=\r\nough senses (e.g.\n&gt; an idol or the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle =\r\nobject perceived\n&gt; by the subtle perception (a deity or the subtle vibratio=\r\nn of a mantra).\n&gt; The focus can be on the gross/subtle object or on the act=\r\n of perceiving\n&gt; the object or on the perceiver (all the three exist within=\r\n one&#39;s\n&gt; consciousness as three different things). One&#39;s self-awareness can=\r\n\n&gt; identify with one object and focus its attention on another object (&quot;I\n&gt;=\r\n am Rajarshi with so and so qualities and I am aware of Bhairava with so\n&gt; =\r\nand so qualities&quot;). Or, one&#39;s self-awareness can identify with that\n&gt; objec=\r\nt (&quot;I am Bhairava with so and so qualities&quot;). Please note that all\n&gt; these =\r\nsamadhis are within the field of duality. There is still a sense\n&gt; of &quot;this=\r\n is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot;, i.e. there is differentiation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The next state is what most people refer to as samadhi. This is a\n=\r\n&gt; state where mind is absorbed in non-dual Self, i.e. without any\n&gt; differe=\r\nntiation. When there are no notions of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is\n&gt; the rest&quot;=\r\n, there are no thoughts, no opposites and there is only\n&gt; Sat-Chid-Ananda (=\r\nthe bliss of just being).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, let me come to what Vi=\r\nmalananda says!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The non-dual Self is Shiva (or Purusha or Narayana)=\r\n. The field of\n&gt; duality is Shakti (or Prakriti or Narayani). Though one ma=\r\ny normally\n&gt; think that Shiva and Shakti are different, are they really dif=\r\nferent?!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Because of our notion that Shiva and Shakti are different,=\r\n we can\n&gt; either be with Shakti or with Shiva at a time but not with both a=\r\nt the\n&gt; same time. A yogi who has objectification and the sense of &quot;this is=\r\n I&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;this is the rest&quot; is in the domain of Shakti. When one overcomes=\r\n\n&gt; objectification and reaches non-dual samadhi, one is in the domain of\n&gt; =\r\nShiva. When one leaves that state and one&#39;s egosense (&quot;this is I&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;th=\r\nis is the rest&quot;) returns, one will *leave* the domain of Shiva and\n&gt; re-ent=\r\ner the field of Shakti. One is prone to be deluded by duality\n&gt; again! That=\r\n is what Vimalananda is saying.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one can be with Shiva *and* Shak=\r\nti at the *same time*, then one is\n&gt; then not enamored or deluded by any as=\r\npect of Shakti. When a small\n&gt; aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes one (&quot;this =\r\nis I&quot;, &quot;that is beautiful&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;that is ugly&quot;, &quot;I like that&quot; etc), one is un=\r\nable to perceive the entire\n&gt; field of Shakti. This is just like a person t=\r\nied to a rock in the ocean\n&gt; not being able to swim the entire ocean. When =\r\none is not bound by any\n&gt; object in the field of Shakti and not attracted o=\r\nr repelled by anything,\n&gt; then one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all =\r\nspace-time\n&gt; combinations. This is possible only if one has perfect mastery=\r\n over\n&gt; Shakti. That comes only when one has zero attachment to anything in=\r\n the\n&gt; field of Shakti. That comes only when one is with Shiva enough and\n&gt;=\r\n eventually becomes like Shiva. If a yogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays\n&gt;=\r\n in it for a long time and happens to come back to the field of duality,\n&gt; =\r\nthen one may become like Shiva and work with Shakti with zero attachment\n&gt; =\r\nand perfect mastery. One is aware of the entire field of duality - all\n&gt; sp=\r\naces and times - and yet unattached to anything. That is because one\n&gt; perc=\r\neives the underlying non-dual Self even as senses perceive various\n&gt; object=\r\ns of duality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For most people, this is out of bounds. One either ex=\r\nperiences\n&gt; non-dual samadhi for a short duration and cannot sustain it lon=\r\nger and\n&gt; comes back to be deluded by duality again, or one stays in non-du=\r\nal\n&gt; samadhi for a long time and does not come back (like a salt doll that\n=\r\n&gt; goes to survey the depth of ocean melting in the ocean, to borrow words\n&gt;=\r\n from Ramakrishna Paramahamsa). Exceptions like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; o=\r\nr Sai Baba, who spent enough time in non-dual samadhi and yet came back\n&gt; t=\r\no live in the world, are so rare in this age.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me =\r\nput this in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in\n&gt; moolaadhaara, ou=\r\nr self-awareness identifies with the physical body and\n&gt; is aware of the ph=\r\nysical world around us. As Kundalini goes to various\n&gt; places in the subtle=\r\n body (there are thousands of nadis and chakras!),\n&gt; one is aware of variou=\r\ns realities that are out there in this universe.\n&gt; For example, one world (=\r\nrealm of awareness) may be reverberating with\n&gt; the sound of a particular b=\r\neejaakshara and filled with a particular\n&gt; light and every being in that wo=\r\nrld may be a small particle in that\n&gt; light reverberating with that sound. =\r\nLike that, there are many worlds\n&gt; out there (within us) and one can enter =\r\na samadhi through any of them,\n&gt; when Kundalini reaches a corresponding pla=\r\nce.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one&#39;s self-awareness is with =\r\nShiva.\n&gt; Shakti loses herself to Shiva and there is no objectification that=\r\n is\n&gt; the hallmark of Shakti. If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lowe=\r\nr\n&gt; chakra, one&#39;s self-awareness is again deluded by duality. However, if\n&gt;=\r\n shakti comes back from sahasrara to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva,\n&gt; t=\r\nhen one is aware of duality and non-dual Self at the same time. One\n&gt; lives=\r\n as a liberated sage, using the body as an instrument to fulfil the\n&gt; will =\r\nof Nature (since there is no longer any individual will).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, =\r\nFree Jyotish\n&gt; textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short=\r\n Homam and Pitri\n&gt; Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- hramalingam@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Sa=\r\nmadi is nothing but killing the mind and the entire thought\n&gt; process\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n This will answer all your questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on=\r\n Reliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1\n&gt; Network.

Moreover, i=\r\nt is tough\n&gt; to capture\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some of these ideas in words, as words convey=\r\n slightly different\n&gt; meaning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different people, based on their lif=\r\ne experiences and\n&gt; predispositions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, there is no formula t=\r\nhat ensures self-realization in a certain\n&gt; amount of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time and it com=\r\nes to one through the grace of God. However, grace of\n&gt; God does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not =\r\ncome to just about anyone - it comes to one who is *ready* to\n&gt; receive it.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One becomes ready to receive it, through the effort put in this life=\r\n\n&gt; and all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditioning. S=\r\no effort\n&gt; and sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are not useless. The effort we are talking abo=\r\nut here is not effort\n&gt; to acquire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something, but effort to give up s=\r\nomething.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though it is not incorrect, the view that things are =\r\ngiven only by\n&gt; God&#39;s grace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can, when misunderstood, promote inaction=\r\n. God&#39;s grace does not come\n&gt; to a lazy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person doing nothing and wait=\r\ning for God&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace does\n&gt; not work\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrarily. God&#39;s g=\r\nrace comes to one who has perfect surrender to\n&gt; God. Perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrend=\r\ner does not come automatically. Though effort and sadhana do\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gu=\r\narantee perfect surrender in a certain amount of time, they do\n&gt; bring it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; eventually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever one does it is ba=\r\nsed on past karmas only\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fruits of past karmas decide one&#39;s curr=\r\nent situation and constrain\n&gt; one&#39;s current\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas (actions). But the=\r\ny do not completely decide one&#39;s current\n&gt; karmas. One&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; current karm=\r\na is in one&#39;s hands (within the constraints).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, one ca=\r\nn ask: Does one have a free will that acts or does\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all-pervading=\r\n shakti act through one? I am quoting a small portion\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vedic-wi=\r\nsdom message 5009\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message=\r\n/5009) below:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All pervading shakti works through all of us and =\r\nexpresses through\n&gt; all of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, actions and knowledge. But th=\r\nen, some universal rules of\n&gt; action and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction govern how this wor=\r\nks. Under the push of one&#39;s own previous\n&gt; karmas, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is placed in s=\r\nituations that are conducive to certain desires,\n&gt; actions and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awaren=\r\ness. The current karmas in those situations may further modify\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmomentum of the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though one&#39;s\n&gt; curre=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, actions and awareness are actually the work of the all\n&gt; =\r\npervading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shakti, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It depends on ho=\r\nw we look\n&gt; at it and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bu=\r\ncket, Ganges water in\n&gt; a small\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot wea=\r\nther and Ganges water in a cup\n&gt; in freezing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weather are all Ganges w=\r\nater, they are different too. One is more,\n&gt; one is less,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one is warm=\r\n and one is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading\n&gt; shakti is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dif=\r\nferent when expressed through different vessels (people) in\n&gt; different\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; situations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one actually feels internally (despit=\r\ne what one may say\n&gt; or pretend\n&gt; &gt; &gt; externally) that one&#39;s desires, actio=\r\nns and knowledge are one&#39;s own,\n&gt; one is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; performing karmas and is bou=\r\nnd to receive their kaarmik reactions.\n&gt; Only when the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realization th=\r\nat it is all the work of the all pervading shakti\n&gt; becomes full and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncompletely internalized, does one become free from the cycle of\n&gt; actions a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one to gi=\r\nve\n&gt; appropriate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reactions to actions one thinks one is performing.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum to=\r\ntal of previous\n&gt; karmas, whose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits one will have to face.

Tendulka=\r\nr may score a century\n&gt; with a terrible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;backache, but we should not =\r\nwalk out to bat with a backache and\n&gt; should try to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;healthy. Afte=\r\nr all, we may not be able to score runs well even when\n&gt; in perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nhealth!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, it must be realiz=\r\ned that external rules are only meant\n&gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;*catalyst* in enabling =\r\ninternal transformation. The goal of all\n&gt; sadhana -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meditation, jap=\r\nam, homam, bhajan, service to others etc - is\n&gt; internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;transformat=\r\nion. If the internal attitude is not getting refined,\n&gt; sadhana is yet\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;to work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a room has a window ou=\r\ntside of which there is heavy wind that\n&gt; is constantly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blowing a lo=\r\nt of dirt into the room, sweeping the room with a broom\n&gt; does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;e=\r\nliminate dirt. First close the window or stop the wind. Similarly,\n&gt; praana=\r\nayaama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental purity, if =\r\nmind\n&gt; (room) is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attached to the objects perceived by senses (window=\r\n).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one reads scriptures and teachi=\r\nngs of saints, contemplates on\n&gt; them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;constantly analyzes inner mot=\r\nives behind various actions by oneself\n&gt; and tries to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change one&#39;s o=\r\nwn thinking slowly, this process of contemplation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;introspection =\r\nwill augment one&#39;s external sadhana (such as\n&gt; meditation, japam,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ho=\r\nmam, bhajan, service etc) and purifies one faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, it is useless to think in terms of Kundalini,\n&gt; a=\r\nwakening Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and raising Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost g=\r\nuaranteed to\n&gt; either block\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini from rising or from reaching t=\r\nhe highest it can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbol=\r\n of one&#39;s own\n&gt; self-awareness. Though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one is the infinite Self (Pur=\r\nusha), one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited\n&gt; object in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;field of duality =\r\n(Shakti) springing in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why\n&gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti=\r\n is worshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti). This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-aw=\r\nareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is\n&gt; so and so\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;person and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is\n&gt; wh=\r\ny Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka o=\r\nr physical\n&gt; realm). As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras=\r\n (other lokas or realms\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who =\r\none is gets refined. When\n&gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reaches sahasrara, one is awar=\r\ne of true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a K=\r\nundalini shakti at so\n&gt; and so point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in this body. It should now ris=\r\ne to so and so point in this body&quot;,\n&gt; it will focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and limit one&#39;s =\r\nself-awareness to the *physical body* and hence\n&gt; one&#39;s Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wi=\r\nll remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise, one needs\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;completely forget about the physical body and stop thinking in\n&gt; terms o=\r\nf it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, *very few* people actually experience Kun=\r\ndalini in\n&gt; higher chakras,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;though many talk about it. Kundalini is =\r\nin Moolaadhaara chakra or\n&gt; atmost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Swadhishthana chakra in most yogi=\r\ns, even advanced and awakened\n&gt; ones. When praana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vaayu flows in som=\r\ne higher chakras, that too can result in a\n&gt; powerful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;experience. So=\r\nme may mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If =\r\nyou want a good score in the examination, study well. Stop\n&gt; thinking too m=\r\nuch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about (and anticipating) the examination and focus on the subjec=\r\nt\n&gt; instead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about kundalini,=\r\n forget\n&gt; about chakras,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forget about the body even. Do sadhana, do =\r\nsadhana and do sadhana.\n&gt; Read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;scriptures and teachings of great sai=\r\nnts. Instead of looking\n&gt; externally and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;judging others, observe you=\r\nr own actions and thoughts, analyze what\n&gt; is driving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;them and consc=\r\niously try to eliminate wrong motives that stem from\n&gt; false ego,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ad=\r\nharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness,\n&gt; jealosy=\r\n),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;i.e. put to use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachings of\n=\r\n&gt; saints.
