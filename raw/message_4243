Sudouski) visi=\r\nt\nto the Ashram of Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1949, was first published in 1953=\r\n.\nIt has been out of print for many years and is now in the process of bein=\r\ng\nrepublished by Sri Ramanasramam. We hope to have it available in our book=\r\n\nstore in a few months.\n\nIn Days of Great Peace inspired many Westerners to=\r\n seek spiritual guidance\nfrom Sri Ramana Maharshi in the years following hi=\r\ns Mahasamadhi.\n\nThrough a narrative that is both simple and profound, the a=\r\nuthor takes us on\nhis journey to the quiet hermitage of the renowned Sage o=\r\nf Arunachala in\nSouth India. Basking in the radiance of the &#39;Great Rishi&#39; h=\r\nis mind turns\ninward, following the path of Self-inquiry of &#39;Who Am I?&#39;. He=\r\n describes,\nwith perceptive insight and emotion, how in the gracious presen=\r\nce of the\nMaster, thoughts are stilled and one rests calmly in the thought-=\r\nfree,\negoless state.\n\nBelow are a few excerpts from various chapters of the=\r\n book.\n\nWhen I arrived at the abode of Maharshi, called &#39;Ramanashram,&#39; and =\r\njumped\nout from the two-wheeled cart just in front of the temple, in spite =\r\nof the\nlate hour, but in accordance with the custom of the place, I was tak=\r\nen\nstraight into the presence of the Sage.\n\nA modest Indian supper was serv=\r\ned a little rice, vegetables and fruit on a\nbanana leaf. By the time I had =\r\nfinished, Maharshi had gone. As soon as I\nfound myself in the small one-roo=\r\nm cottage prepared for me in the Ashram&#39;s\ncompound, I immediately fell asle=\r\nep, being very tired after my whole day&#39;s\njourney.\n\nLife in Maharshi&#39;s Ashr=\r\nam\n\nAt 7 A.M. there was the loud sound of a gong calling us to breakfast. W=\r\nhen I\nreached the dining hall, Maharshi was just mounting the few steps lea=\r\nding to\nit. He was accompanied by several Indians, his permanent attendants=\r\n. Here,\nin full daylight, I noticed for the first time that the physical st=\r\nate of\nMaharshi was really precarious. He walked with difficulty, as his jo=\r\nints and\nknees were affected by acute rheumatism. His left arm and elbow we=\r\nre\nbandaged because of a malignant tumour, which had begun its growth about=\r\n six\nmonths earlier and, in spite of two operations, had continued to sprea=\r\nd its\ndevastating work, causing Maharshi&#39;s death one year later.Sometimes h=\r\nis head\nshook slightly and this increased the impression of serious ill hea=\r\nlth; the\nwhole frame, once tall and powerful, was now bent and weak.\n\nThe S=\r\nage ate with his hand according to the general Indian custom. His\nmovements=\r\n seemed to be automatic. I saw that he was quite aware of his\nsurroundings =\r\nand reacted in a normal way to all the phenomena of the outward\nworld, but =\r\nI felt certain that his real Self had nothing to do with the\nfunctions and =\r\nactions of his visible vehicle.\n\nThere are three communal meals in the Ashr=\r\nam: lunch or dinner at about 11:30\nA.M., supper at 7.30 P.M. and also tea a=\r\nt 3.30 P.M. for the Ashram guests\nand occasional visitors. One is given tea=\r\n, coffee, or by special request,\nmilk, as was the case with me. The dishes =\r\nare well prepared, but some\nvegetables and pastry have many condiments adde=\r\nd and are too hot for the\nEuropean palate. [Less spicy preparations are now=\r\n available for Westerners]\n\nMaharshi took a little of everything. At the en=\r\nd of the meal, when\nbuttermilk was distributed, he made a kind of round wal=\r\nl of rice, leaving a\nspace in the middle for the liquid. When he had enough=\r\n he stopped, with a\ngesture to the Brahmin who was serving. He never left a=\r\n single grain of rice\non his leaf.\n\nFarewell\n\nAnd I begin to tell Him slowl=\r\ny and clearly that I have to leave the Ashram\nand beg His permission, and a=\r\nfter He nods in consent, I proceed to ask His\nblessing for my present, my f=\r\nuture, and forever. His eyes seem even more\nluminous; the face, expressing =\r\na superhuman kindness, seems to become more\nserious. He gives me the blessi=\r\nng. I know He sees my next, still unexpressed\nentreaty. I do not hear any w=\r\nords, yet I feel He is asking me whether I am\naware of the meaning of my ow=\r\nn prayer. And without moving my lips, I give\nHim my answer. Yet all is so n=\r\natural, so simple, so real, that I would\nrather doubt my standing here than=\r\n this mute conversation. A short silence\nfollows.\n\nI bow my head and feel t=\r\nhe touch of his hand on my brow, the delicate touch\nof his fingers along my=\r\n head. A subtle current of power and purity passes\nthrough my whole frame.\n=\r\n\nIn a lightning flash, I realize that the power of this moment will sustain=\r\n\nme in all the years to come, and its light will for ever shine on my life.=\r\n\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2001/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b2ac5099390d048521fe16\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIn Days of Great Peace, a book recounting Mouni Sadhu&#39;s (M. =\r\nSudouski) visit to the Ashram of Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1949, was first pub=\r\nlished in 1953.
