Kaala Bhairavaashtak=\r\nam composed by Aadi Shankara at Kashi is particularly beautiful. A few mant=\r\nras are contained in the Kaala Bhairava Homam manual (see homam site below)=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, one can perform a homam to Kaala Bhairava also.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Th=\r\ne best way to worship a deity, however, is to imbibe the qualities represen=\r\nted by that deity. All the 14 worlds and their inhabitants, including deiti=\r\nes, live in one&#39;s body in microcosmic form (and, microcosm is identical to =\r\nthe macrocosm). Each deity is a personification of some qualities inside us=\r\n. Different qualities endow us with different kinds of shakti (capability t=\r\no get certain things done). If we increase certain qualities and build cert=\r\nain shakti, we are effectively making the corresponding deity manifest in u=\r\ns. THAT is the best way to worship any deity!\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one wants to worship=\r\n Bhairava internally, one should develop a fearless, straight-forward and u=\r\nncomplicated personality. Nothing should bind one - relations, job, positio=\r\nn, power, belongings etc. One should want nothing and accept whatever comes=\r\n to one naturally. One should not do something (or keep from doing somethin=\r\ng one feels like doing!) for fear of what others may think about one or wil=\r\nl say. One should not care about one&#39;s image, one&#39;s status, one&#39;s belonging=\r\ns and one&#39;s position. Follow what seems like one&#39;s dharma with absolute fea=\r\nrlessness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one successfully imbibes various such qualities attribu=\r\nted to Bhairava and lives life like that, one&#39;s every action and thought an=\r\nd one&#39;s whole life will be a worship of Bhairava.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Same thing can be s=\r\naid about other deities also. The best way to worship any deity is to imbib=\r\ne the qualities attributed to that deity (not pretend outwardly, but be lik=\r\ne that inwardly). Don&#39;t think that it is not possible. It is not only possi=\r\nble, but it is going to happen in the coming decades. Many sadhakas will de=\r\nmonstrate this in coming decades and that will help to strengthen the hold =\r\nof Sanatana Dharma on the world. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- =\r\n&quot;J.&quot; &lt;jkoperumcholan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Shri Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which =\r\nis the best way to perform worship to Lord Bhairava?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; J.
