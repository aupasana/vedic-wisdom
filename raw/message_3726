Here G is h=\r\ner gotra, N is nakshatra, R is janma raashi, L is lagna and X is the name.\n=\r\n\n(3) Homam to Shiva using the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra is ideal for this pur=\r\npose, though you can really do any homam you want. One specific offering is=\r\n mentioned. Make paayasam (cook rice in milk and ghee, i.e. clarified butte=\r\nr, and add jaggery). Offer darbhas (sacred dry grass) dipped in paayasam wi=\r\nth each repetition of the mantra, if possible.\n\n(4) The instinct to help so=\r\nmeone else and reduce someone else&#39;s suffering is a very noble and useful o=\r\nne.\n\nHowever, it is not without its costs. Basically remember that the worl=\r\nd runs based on actions and reactions. Any suffering someone is experiencin=\r\ng is a reaction to a previous action committed by that person. If you want =\r\nto take it on yourself, you will either have to experience the reaction or =\r\nburn the karma (action) though sadhana, i.e. convert the reaction into some=\r\nthing else using some energy.\n\nOf course, taking on someone else&#39;s sufferin=\r\ng and suffering oneself is not easy. So what you are really trying to do is=\r\n to burn the karma using the energy created by a focused sadhana such as ho=\r\nmam or japam. This is akin to someone throwing a ball at a wall and the bal=\r\nl coming at that person fast later and you trying to burn it on the way (us=\r\ning some energy such as heat).\n\nThe problem is that your sadhana may not su=\r\ncceed in perfectly avoiding the reaction. In other words, the ball that bou=\r\nnced back may not be reduced to ashes fully and some small pieces of the ba=\r\nll may still come and hit that person (or you on his/her behalf). Not being=\r\n rishis, we cannot perfectly control the dynamics. Think for a moment if yo=\r\nu are fine with taking a bit of suffering if needed, as a result of avoidin=\r\ng a major catastrophe for that person.\n\n(5) Some learned Adwaitis may corre=\r\nctly say, &quot;all is Brahman. Life and death is the same. Aatman is neither bo=\r\nrn nor does it die. What is there to worry if someone is suffering or close=\r\n to death?&quot;\n\nHowever, that is a wrong approach. Both duality and non-dualit=\r\ny are valid and true. It is easy to sit on the bank and tell someone drowni=\r\nng in the ocean, &quot;you are ocean are the same. Do not worry&quot;. If one is real=\r\nly at a stage where one can think like that even when one is drowning in oc=\r\nean and not worry, THEN one is a true adwaita jnaani. Otherwise, it is just=\r\n bookish knowledge and means nothing.\n\nBecause the world has so many people=\r\n stuck in the duality (good vs bad, happy vs sad, beautiful vs ugly etc pol=\r\narities), rishis have given knowledge that helps one swim the ocean of pola=\r\nrities and ultimately realize Self. Merely stating that all is Brahman may =\r\nnot help anybody realize that. Until one realizes that, one needs tools to =\r\nnavigate the ocean of duality.\n\nLet me put it this way: When YOU find yours=\r\nelf in various situations that cause pleasure and pain, try to think like a=\r\nn Adwaiti and remind yourself that all is Brahman. When you are dealing wit=\r\nh someone else who is in great pain, forget adwaita and try to identify wit=\r\nh that person and feel the person&#39;s pain. That will not do any harm to your=\r\n spiritual progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri=\r\n tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--=\r\n-- prm7782 &lt;prm7782@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; I recently found out that a small=\r\n 5 year old girl(friend of my daughters) has been very sick and is hospital=\r\nised.
