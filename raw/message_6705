She wandered about as a parivrajaki =\r\nor itinerant woman and had a controversy with Raja Janaka. She was a Brahma=\r\njnani.\n\nSri Gauri Mataji was a sannyasini. She was the president of the Sar=\r\nadamani Ashram. Sri Durga Mataji is the present president of the ashram. Sh=\r\ne is a graduate.\n\nSri Omkar-Ishwari was a learned sannyasini. She was a Ved=\r\nantini. She lived in Rishikesh. She had a small group of disciples; some we=\r\nre males, some were females.\n\nSri Swami Malayalaswami of Vyasa-Ashram, Yerp=\r\nedu, Chittor Dt., has many sannyasini disciples.\n\nThe late Swami Poornanand=\r\na of Sivalaya, Rishikesh, a cultured sannyasin of great reputation, had san=\r\nnyasini disciples.\n\nThe daughter of the late Sri Chakravarty of Uttara-Brin=\r\ndavan, Almora, has taken sannyasa.\n\nEven ladies born in rich families, like=\r\n Sri Sushila Mangaldas of Bombay, do not want to marry and want to follow t=\r\nhe spiritual path. This clearly shows that there is a sannyasa tendency in =\r\nthem.\n\n\n"}}
