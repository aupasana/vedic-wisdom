I lear=\r\nnt that the twigs need to be cut vertically for them to burn better.\nSecond=\r\nly, the full dry coconut did not burn completely in the poornahuti and if I=\r\n put a half one or a piece it would have burnt completely.\nAlso, the dharbh=\r\nas I have were a bit bent and I could not put them pointed to north or sout=\r\nh or the other directions correctly. Hope that was ok too !\n\nNow some quest=\r\nions (I am sure these have been answered, I apologize, but would appreciate=\r\n if you respond again); btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much obl=\r\niged.\n1. what do I do with the partially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use it to=\r\nmorrow ? Also, what does one do with all the ash and the burnt part? What i=\r\ns the holy way to dispose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! Do I=\r\n put them under a tree and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, in the=\r\n apts I live here.\n2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use=\r\n them again? Or do they need to be disposed off ?\n3. Is it advisable to dip=\r\n (not pour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?\n\nLet me know of =\r\nother points I might have known for a beginner.\n\nFinally, a million thanks =\r\nand appreciations for all who are responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) for th=\r\ne KT.\n\nregards\nrAma\n\n\n"}}
