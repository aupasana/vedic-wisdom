We tell him that he should go to so and so institu=\r\ntion (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or get=\r\nting 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of education. The goal of education=\r\n is to understand the subject well and have a good career. It is possible t=\r\no get 90% score without understanding well and it is possible to go to IIT =\r\nand not understand the subject well.\n\nSimilarly, the goal of spiritual sadh=\r\nana is to get better control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as mu=\r\nch as possible and become liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so ri=\r\ntuals, follow so and so procedures/formulas , go to so and so temple etc.\n\n=\r\nSome formulas were created so that there is some structure to sadhana. But =\r\nthere is nothing absolute about those formulas.\n\nYes, if your gurus told yo=\r\nu the formula of n times japam, n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc a=\r\nnd you want to follow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people believe =\r\nthat such a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in a mantra.\n\nHowever, please note tha=\r\nt there are many people who did purascharanas using such formulas and did n=\r\not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the mantra. On the other hand, there are peop=\r\nle who did not stick to those formulas and yet found god through the mantra=\r\n.\n\nIn my opinion, you can do just japam with a mantra without worrying abou=\r\nt 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantr=\r\na entirely in homam without any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice and d=\r\no it until your mind is so absorbed in it that your mind is chanting that m=\r\nantra sub-consciously when it is free (like some people hum catchy songs wh=\r\nen they are free).\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegarding the astrological formulas fo=\r\nr evaluating the impact of a mantra, I would like disown those concepts ori=\r\nginally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my astrology classes. =\r\nThere are many technicalities, but many many corruptions in the way knowled=\r\nge is preserved. Most rules and technicalities of mantra shashtra apply to =\r\npeople who do prayogas to get specific material results (and naturally thos=\r\ne rules have been intentionally corrupted by Nature in preparation of deepe=\r\nning Kali).\n\nBottomline is that a mantra done for spiritual progress works =\r\nbased on your mental visualization of the mantra and its deity and the late=\r\nnt forces of conditioning in your mind. All the house calculations based on=\r\n the numbers of letters and number of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a ved=\r\na mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by anyone without worrying about t=\r\nechnicalities.\n\nRegarding adding &quot;Om&quot; or &quot;Om Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh =\r\nom bhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there are many standard approaches. I s=\r\nuggest using what you were taught by your gurus and not worrying too much a=\r\nbout it.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nUtpal asked about count vs time.

Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could s=\r\nee significant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Ga=\r\nyatri Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then=\r\n (in future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it w=\r\nas one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two mont=\r\nhs and then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, =\r\nhowever, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether=\r\n) and we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how =\r\nour Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpa=\r\nnam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding t=\r\nhe number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must=\r\n be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the =\r\nbig japams must be done. Can you shed more light on\n this? \n=C2=A0\nAlso, Ga=\r\nyatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if =\r\nthe vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu v=\r\nah=C2=A0). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th =\r\nhouse, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explana=\r\ntion? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrate=\r\nd here and could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretat=\r\nion is right and also please tell me which approach is better. \n=C2=A0\nNagr=\r\naj\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, Narasimha P.V.R.

The=\r\nn possibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like th=\r\nat, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.\n\nOf course, if needs no break, one=\r\n can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may b=\r\ne difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.\n\nFor suc=\r\ncess in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and=\r\n control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (p=\r\nurifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some=\r\n shakti.\n\nEvery factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. Th=\r\ne tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without=\r\n a reason. We discussed this sometime back.\n\nIf one is living a lifestyle w=\r\nhere one avoids contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. livin=\r\ng in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one =\r\nis living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations r=\r\negularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), =\r\nbeard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard i=\r\ns not the complete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a rai=\r\nling on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding o=\r\nff the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control=\r\n, similarly a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to =\r\nretain control in some tricky situations.\n\nTrimming beard is ok.\n\n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n\nIf one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple=\r\n of hours) everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya, \nwhile fol=\r\nlowing the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the sa=\r\nme direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one ke=\r\ny thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes c=\r\nlosed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost =\r\nzero if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is=\r\n a chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is sti=\r\nll for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to =\r\nbeing still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then var=\r\nious kinds of samadhis become possible.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that =\r\nmake a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/1=\r\n0, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@=\r\nyahoo. com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri =\r\nsadhana procedure\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, Janua=\r\nry 20, 2010, 8:40 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great mail and very inspirin=\r\ng.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experience t=\r\nhe Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done corre=\r\nctly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; De=\r\nity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deit=\r\ny commanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good o=\r\nr be it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is cruc=\r\nial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so s=\r\nelf\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to me=\r\n which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and de=\r\nity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinn=\r\namasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have =\r\nVijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm o=\r\nf the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate=\r\n realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings th=\r\ne full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people=\r\n may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath b=\r\nurying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some p=\r\neople may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic.

W=\r\ne tell him that he should go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , RE=\r\nC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is=\r\n NOT the goal of education. The goal of education is to understand the subj=\r\nect well and have a good career. It is possible to get 90% score without un=\r\nderstanding well and it is possible to go to IIT and not understand the sub=\r\nject well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get better=\r\n control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as much as possible and b=\r\necome liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so rituals, follow so and=\r\n so procedures/formulas , go to so and so temple etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some formulas =\r\nwere created so that there is some structure to sadhana. But there is nothi=\r\nng absolute about those formulas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, if your gurus told you the fo=\r\nrmula of n times japam, n/10 times\n homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you =\r\nwant to follow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people believe that su=\r\nch a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, please note that=\r\n there are many people who did purascharanas using such formulas and did no=\r\nt really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the mantra. On the other hand, there are peopl=\r\ne who did not stick to those formulas and yet found god through the mantra.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In my opinion, you can do just japam with a mantra without worrying=\r\n about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a =\r\nmantra entirely in homam without any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice =\r\nand do it until your mind is so absorbed in it that your mind is chanting t=\r\nhat mantra sub-consciously when it is free (like some people hum catchy son=\r\ngs when they are free).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding the astrolog=\r\nical formulas for evaluating\n the impact of a mantra, I would like disown t=\r\nhose concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my as=\r\ntrology classes. There are many technicalities, but many many corruptions i=\r\nn the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and technicalities of mantra s=\r\nhashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get specific material results (a=\r\nnd naturally those rules have been intentionally corrupted by Nature in pre=\r\nparation of deepening Kali).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that a mantra done for sp=\r\niritual progress works based on your mental visualization of the mantra and=\r\n its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your mind. All the hous=\r\ne calculations based on the numbers of letters and number of words are irre=\r\nlevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by anyone w=\r\nithout worrying about technicalities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding adding &quot;Om&quot; or &quot;Om B=\r\nhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there are =\r\nmany standard\n approaches. I suggest using what you were taught by your gur=\r\nus and not worrying too much about it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal a=\r\nsked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people to speed things up.=\r\n In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g. =\r\none hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespective of the cou=\r\nnt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality:\n=\r\n http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, 1=\r\n/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;I&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLO=\r\nCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Nagraj Kota &=\r\nlt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Repost:Manis=\r\nhji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 11:47 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv162=\r\n0719101&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=\r\n=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: inh=\r\nerit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit&quot; vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nNarasimhagaru, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for such a nice expl=\r\nanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant pr=\r\nogress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in th=\r\ne past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I wil=\r\nl practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh pur=\r\nascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then I did=\r\n a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have c=\r\nalled about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did =\r\nchant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji inst=\r\nructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa f=\r\nor marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brah=\r\nmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finis=\r\nh the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams must b=\r\ne done. Can you shed more light\n on this? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Als=\r\no, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., bu=\r\nt if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va =\r\nssu vah&nbsp;). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the=\r\n 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your ex=\r\nplanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly inte=\r\ngrated here and could not avoid this question).

Then possib=\r\nly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that, do f=\r\nor 3 stretches of 100 days each.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, if needs no break, one c=\r\nan do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be =\r\ndifficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For=\r\n success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex=\r\n and control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakt=\r\ni (purifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses =\r\nsome shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every factor contributes a little to success. Beard is =\r\nuseful. The tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is n=\r\not without a reason. We discussed this sometime back.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one is livi=\r\nng a lifestyle where one avoids\n contact with any tempting situations altog=\r\nether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much va=\r\nlue. But, if one is living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with temp=\r\nting situations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family an=\r\nd job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discus=\r\nsed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part of the soluti=\r\non. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving c=\r\nar from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving c=\r\nar out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with decent control =\r\nover the mind to retain control in some tricky situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Trimming =\r\nbeard is ok.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one indeed does 1000 times Gay=\r\natri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one year while main=\r\ntaining brahmacharya,\n &lt;BR&gt;while following the simple rules of same place, =\r\nsame time everyday and facing the same direction, one will certainly make g=\r\nood progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still with an erect=\r\n back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. The probabili=\r\nty of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If the b=\r\nody can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also become st=\r\nill for a moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cause gre=\r\nat bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still more =\r\noften and for longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis become possible.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, 1/20=\r\n/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;I&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Nagraj Kota &lt;=\r\nnagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39; s =\r\nsavitur gayatri sadhana procedure&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nDate: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1423440994&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cell=\r\nPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: inherit; fon=\r\nt-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit&quot; vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is a=\r\n great mail and very inspiring.

How can i&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; again experience the Belov=\r\ned.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done corr=\r\nectly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the =\r\ndeity&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences him=\r\nself as that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There then arises no=\r\n difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; certain th=\r\ning to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; whi=\r\nch appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &=\r\ngt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; continues.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=\r\n=82 according to me which is black magic.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is all a use of S=\r\nhakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; such as Pra=\r\nchand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; w=\r\nill be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he=\r\n was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm rese=\r\nrved for these&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; beings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak br=\r\nings the full bearing of karma onto the heads&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the attackers=\r\n and some people may realise this to their detriment(&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Patan co=\r\nmes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Sh=\r\nakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you atta=\r\nck&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from tha=\r\nt same Atma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But=\r\n if you attack&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe a=\r\nnd has very few karmas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks =\r\nyou, because your attack is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his ide=\r\nntification, ie God or the universe).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If people persist in usi=\r\nng the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there i=\r\ns only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then =\r\ntheir minds and intellects will not be free of identification with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed as&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits\n which=\r\n they have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable ex=\r\nperience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a fe=\r\nw lifetimes, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to tha=\r\nt deity and such a sadhak&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of=\r\n a mantra(because of his previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On the=\r\n other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; According to me the pro=\r\nof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest an easy =\r\nsadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day=\r\n, do 1000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=\r\n=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, mai=\r\nn constraints&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same\n place.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same materials.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As li=\r\nttle movement as one can.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is yo=\r\nur inclination.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and th=\r\ne body, not just the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are e=\r\nmpty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; before you start.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days=\r\n and do this whole procedure 3 times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; See the difference in yo=\r\nur personality before and after.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is impo=\r\nrtant is that life may be short, so do some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persi=\r\nst with that sadhana for as long as is physically&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; possible.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being disc=\r\nussed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nmanish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n clarification from =\r\nme if you feel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTERNET now=\r\n has a personality.
