Let me narr=\r\nate the same here.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On his way to Gangotri, an individual named &quot;P&quot; =\r\nreached a small, less-populated village. It was evening and a slight drizzl=\r\ne poured on the backdrop of a orange colored setting sun. He was wondering =\r\nwhere to spend the night, when he suddenly found a Bhairavi standing infron=\r\nt of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not that popular in these par=\r\nts of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari, had a=\r\n jata on her head and a trishul in one hand and small cloth tied into a kno=\r\nt in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years of age and was strikingly=\r\n beautiful looking.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Before he could open his mouth, she started spe=\r\naking and speaking. First she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marathi=\r\n. Because of his travels across India, the author was familiar with the sou=\r\nnd of different Indian languages but could not understand them. Then she sp=\r\noke in Bengali which was the P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Are you going to Gangotri?=\r\n Have you found a place to stay for the night?&quot;. P was not too pleased seei=\r\nng her. He loved his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. S=\r\no to avoid her, he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it i=\r\ns extremely dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested wit=\r\nh snakes and scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and it=\r\n was afterall only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the stayi=\r\nng place was reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a =\r\ntree, laid out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. T=\r\nhen she asked him if\n&gt;  had any food. P replied he did not, plus all the sh=\r\nops in the area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and sa=\r\nid she has to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. Aft=\r\ner about half and hour she returned back with a something tied in a cloth. =\r\nShe opened the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the=\r\n author to eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was told tha=\r\nt near the bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she got the fo=\r\nod from there. She herself did not eat anything but gave the food to the hi=\r\nm, saying she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food and confessed th=\r\nat he would have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for her, because he d=\r\nid not have money to buy food. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She asked with surprise, &quot;You have =\r\ncome so far with any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC.&quot; On hearing his an=\r\nswers, she asked, &quot;So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the wil=\r\nl of Jagadamba?&quot;.\n&gt; He replied, &quot;Well at least on regarding the food, defin=\r\nitely!&quot;\n&gt; Bhairavi, &quot;You people have petty minds, without any gains you don=\r\n&#39;t listen to anything, you don&#39;t interact freely with others&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; He aske=\r\nd,&quot; Are you a Tantrik?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes. What is your bhava?&quot;\n&gt; P, &quot;I do =\r\nnot have fixed path, but I am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana.=\r\n Can you ask you some questions about Tantra? Can a person attain God throu=\r\ngh the path of Tantra?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She sat down crosslegged in padmasana and r=\r\neplied, &quot; The word God means different things to different people. Then att=\r\naining God has even more different and complex meanings to everyone based o=\r\nn their own ideas. This is not like attaining some property or money. It ca=\r\nn be attained by various path, and then again it can attained by no-path at=\r\n all. And the most complex thing in all this is what you refer to as God is=\r\n not something that is to be possessed at all! Are you satisfied with the a=\r\nnswer?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; P: &quot;What is the aim of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible =\r\nbenefit? Those who are Tantriks or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they will ach=\r\nieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which is vira-chara, is about becoming =\r\nfree from chains (pashas). Only when the chains have been broken that divin=\r\ne Shakti is awakened in the body. Now if someone then uses this Divine Shak=\r\nti for personal gains, then they head towards great calamity. Those who use=\r\n it for the good of humanity, they become really divine&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Till now she=\r\n was speaking calmly. Now P asked, &quot;But the answer that you gave seems like=\r\n a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply that man cannot attain God through=\r\n Tantra?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhairavi:&quot;If you had been intelligent, you would not have as=\r\nked this question. Forget about attaining God for the moment, first learn t=\r\no acquire shakti. Have you done that? Start immediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s =\r\ngrace you will accomplish. This I can guarantee.=C2=A0 First become a Shakt=\r\niman, understand what is Shakti and how much Shakti you are capable of hold=\r\ning in your body and mind. Understood? Don&#39;t waste your time in useless deb=\r\nates. Did you understand what I am saying?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bhairavi looked angry,=\r\n the color of her face has suddenly changed and her eyes become still and u=\r\nnblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She continued:&quot; All these idiots h=\r\naving read a few books here and there have only learnt useless debates and =\r\ntime-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Shaktihin (sans Shakti), me=\r\ndhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you guys get kicked from you=\r\nr bosses in office, and the come home and show off your impotency on your w=\r\nives and mothers. And you want to debate on Shakti sadhana! This is ridicul=\r\nous!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; P got unnerved and was certain that she is a mad woman. The mome=\r\nnt this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a lightning pace and scre=\r\named back, &quot; Oh you think I am mad? You don&#39;t know who I am. I can destroy =\r\nyou completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktiman. Do you want to see=\r\n?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His mind became stunned into silence. He did not know what to say. =\r\nIn fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any conversation and=\r\n started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wondered if he should=\r\n now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she came over to where =\r\nhe was sitting and held his shoulders, &quot;Where will you run? Do you think yo=\r\nu have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it? I consider peo=\r\nple like you nothing more than insects. You&#39;ve left your wife and son and g=\r\none out roaming to peform Dharma! You don&#39;t even know what Dharma means. An=\r\n idiot of the first order. People like you are sheep, not men. Escapists an=\r\nd cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha into the Ganges. It&#39;s nonse=\r\nnse. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do you know what is yoga, runnin=\r\ng away from life and believing that by escaping one attains to renunciation=\r\n. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dead decayed individuals. A shee=\r\np\n&gt;  whose only contribution to life is to reproduce some more sheep and th=\r\nen run away from them. Idiot!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In fear and shame the P felt like he wo=\r\nuld faint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he felt so depre=\r\nssed about himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a trance he fe=\r\nlt his \n&gt; \n&gt; vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall down=\r\n on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoulders=\r\n and said, &quot;There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your heart =\r\nand mind. How dare you argue and dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits you =\r\nand you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are you =\r\nfree from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through you&quot;. H=\r\ne could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt ashamed of=\r\n himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet and =\r\nstarted crying, &quot;Ma please save me.=C2=A0 You are right. I am an idiot, I a=\r\nm a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and child=\r\nren at home. I am weak of mind and heart.&quot; His voice became choked with tea=\r\nrs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with he=\r\nr right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed colo=\r\nr and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. &quot;What do you think I a=\r\nm? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving m=\r\nad woman?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And P replied, &quot;But I have not said anything to you like=\r\n that, have I?&quot;. Hearing this she became furious with anger, &quot;Will you peop=\r\nle never become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie thr=\r\nough your teeth when asked. Don&#39;t you have any tej, shakti anything at all?=\r\n Lying to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft lik=\r\ne mud who can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by sit=\r\nuations? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do =\r\nyou do in life?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; P replied he was a painter before he left home. Heari=\r\nng this her eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger comp=\r\nletely and asked,&quot; Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a g=\r\nood artist? Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone wh=\r\no can draw her properly&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; P, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easi=\r\nly available in the market for a very little price&quot;. Hearing this she start=\r\ned roaring with laughter, &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta=\r\n? \n&gt; \n&gt; Have you gone mad? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; P, &quot;I find her image ver=\r\ny violent and terrifying&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud =\r\nthat it sounded like a humkar, &quot;Fool! For people like you who are worst tha=\r\nn women, it is but natural that Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying.=\r\n People who are scared at the first sight of blood and death will not appre=\r\nciate her beauty! Those who remain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap v=\r\ns punya, sarga vs naraka, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot understan=\r\nd the madness of Chinnamasta. You will only be able to draw a white Saraswa=\r\nti with her beena and live trying to deny the other aspects and realities o=\r\nf life, the death and the decay and never see the grand play of the Univers=\r\ne. For you and your ilk, a woman is an object of subconscious revulsion, yo=\r\nu run scared when you see the first woman approaching, you run away from yo=\r\nur own wife, how on earth can you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta=\r\n?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Then she pushed him with her hand. He fell on the floor. She contin=\r\nued, &quot;Go drown yourself in the Ganges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba=\r\n Durga that She may make you fit to hold shakti in your next life. Or at le=\r\nast beg Her, implore Her, that She may grant you intelligence to understand=\r\n what is Shakti-tattwa.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hearing these words, P was so depressed that =\r\nhis mind plunged into chaos and darkness. Like in a state of debilitating t=\r\nrance, he got up from the floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was not there in=\r\n the room. He looked all around him. Then he saw her on the road outside, w=\r\nalking towards the ganges. He cried out to her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me here, I mus=\r\nt know who you are. I am confused about life and everything else&quot;. As soon =\r\nas he uttered these words, the room started reverberating with a attahasa, =\r\nthough there was not a soul present there apart from him. A laughter so lou=\r\nd that he left his ear drums will split. He rushed out into the rain to fol=\r\nlow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ran, the more did the =\r\ndistance keep increasing between him and the Bhairavi. Then he could see cl=\r\nearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water, and kept moving deeper =\r\nuntil she was drowned completely in the water. The author sat near the bank=\r\ns, shouting out to her,\n&gt;  asking her to come out and help him. But there w=\r\nas no response. Just the regular lapping sound of waves hitting the shore a=\r\nnd a very dark night. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He sat there till sunrise, transfixed by the=\r\n bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and asked around the village, but=\r\n no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was there any shop near the banks=\r\n which sold food. Because of the heavy rains, everything was shut down last=\r\n night with not a soul in the open.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Years later, P went back home t=\r\no his wife and son and lead a full and complete family life. I have merely =\r\nnarrated the incident as it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha me=\r\nre aage\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek baat ha=\r\nin ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  Fro=\r\nm: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\n&lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Sunday, 17 June 2012 5:51 PM\n&gt; Subj=\r\nect: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability and Personal Grace of Sri Maha=\r\nvidya&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Hello, \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 This letter is to cheer you up and it is=C2=A0a stran=\r\nge but true personal experience.\n&gt; Divine Mother cares and protects her chi=\r\nldren all the time and also plays snakes and ladders and ludo with them. Bh=\r\nagvati Sri Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop is very dif=\r\nficult to look at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gone by few wee=\r\nks ago.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Many years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu =\r\ncame one late evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite c=\r\norner and told me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glo=\r\nw on his face and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he =\r\nalso gave me a Mantra of=C2=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu le=\r\nft in the morning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me =\r\ndid not happen and this tithi became very upsetting for me.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Some=\r\n years back here in London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a c=\r\nrowded bus and holding on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tith=\r\ni of Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra&#92;name and try=\r\n to meditate on Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strang=\r\neness of that situation. After few more minutes I reached home and opened m=\r\ny front door and went inside. After going through my Puja room and telling =\r\nmy mother that I was back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very ne=\r\nar to front gate. Then I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept f=\r\nor nearly one hour. After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front =\r\ndoor although nobody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was c=\r\novered in Police lines and tapes. I could not believe it. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I ask=\r\ned a policeman who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were sh=\r\nooting at each other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that=\r\n day I was clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner=\r\n sky several minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although=\r\n there was no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without know=\r\ning a single thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman=\r\n.and whole noises and drama.\n&gt; What else is this but Personal Grace of Bhag=\r\nvati Sri=C2=A0Chinnmastaji\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; GoodLuck=C2=A0 and Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNara=\r\nyan\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; rom: Priya M &lt;p=\r\nrm7782@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re=\r\n: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namast=\r\ne \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna ji, afew of us whom you consider are blessed with the des=\r\nire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail.
