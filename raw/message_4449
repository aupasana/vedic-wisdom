There is nothing wrong in off=\r\nering dry coconut pieces instead.\n\nThe most important part of upanayanam is=\r\n the brahmopadesa, i.e. teaching of the Gayatri mantra. All other things ar=\r\ne secondary. For example, many priests re-enact all the rituals that were s=\r\nupposed to be done since birth (e.g. naming, first feeding, first shaving e=\r\ntc), just in case those samskaras were skipped earlier. One can wonder if t=\r\nhat is really necessary and whether it has any real impact on one&#39;s spiritu=\r\nal evolution.\n\nThere is also a lot of fake drama enacted. The young person =\r\nand his father repeat things in Sanskrit that are told by the priest. Those=\r\n who know Sanskrit will see that the young man says he is going to go to Ka=\r\nshi and learn Veda etc. He says he will live by begging alms from now on. H=\r\ne even practices it by asking all attendees for alms. There is a lot of ent=\r\nertaining drama. Of course, most boys getting upanayanam do not really inte=\r\nnd to leave parents, go to Kashi to learn Veda and do not really plan to li=\r\nve by begging! A lot of things they say are simply lies, done just for fun =\r\nand to enact a drama based on how things could have been in old days!\n\n* * =\r\n*\n\nPut bluntly, being given a mantra by a guru is essentially a spiritual e=\r\nvent and not a social event or a party, though upanayanam has transformed f=\r\nrom a spiritual event into a social event. All you really need is the young=\r\n man and his guru sitting in one place and the mantra being taught. You don=\r\n&#39;t need a big crowd.\n\nOf course, one may say that a big crowd is needed to =\r\ncome and give blessings, but &quot;blessings&quot; are a misunderstood and overrated =\r\nconcept. For someone to give you blessings that do some good to you, the pe=\r\nrson should have something in his karmik account and the ability to transfe=\r\nr it to you. Most of the times, blessings given by people in our society ar=\r\ne a mere formality and mean nothing, like checks that have &quot;void - this is =\r\nnot a real check&quot; printed on them.\n\nInstead of hundred people with various =\r\nlevels of interest in the goings on visiting the function out of social com=\r\npulsion and watching possibly with boredom, an ideal setup for an upanayana=\r\nm is just the sishya and guru and some sadhakas related to them who have do=\r\nne sadhana and wish the young man well.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you ask me, the most imp=\r\nortant thing is this. The person who is transmitting the Gayatri mantra (us=\r\nually father) should intensify his spiritual sadhana, especially with Gayat=\r\nri mantra, in the months before upanayanam. If possible, keep brahmacharya =\r\nfor a few months and chant Gayatri mantra for an hour or two everyday. Duri=\r\nng that time, he should never say Gayatri mantra out loud.\n\nWhen he transmi=\r\nts the mantra, he should ensure that only the young man hears it and nobody=\r\n else does (i.e. no dilution in the transmitted energy). The custom is to s=\r\nay it in the ear while a cloth covers both, but that only *symbolizes* secr=\r\netiveness and may not really *ensure* secretiveness. If everybody (especial=\r\nly the priest) is sitting close to them, they may also hear it in spite of =\r\na the cloth covering them.\n\nWhen I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rit=\r\nuals in open air in our back yard. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I t=\r\nook my son inside the pooja room where I did my sadhana. I did not allow an=\r\nybody, including the priests, to come there. I taught the mantra to my son =\r\nin an low, but audible, voice. I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a=\r\n few times, ensured his pronunciation was correct, and then both of us did =\r\na maalaa (108 times meditation) with it silently. We then came back to the =\r\nbackyard and the rituals continued.\n\nOne more thing on muhurta: If you got =\r\na muhurta from an astrologer you trust and want to follow it, please ensure=\r\n that Gayatri mantra is taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Som=\r\ne priests put a paste made of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man&#39;s he=\r\nad at the muhurta time. That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thi=\r\nng.\n\n* * *\n\nThough we did a detailed ritual for my son&#39;s upanayanam, my own=\r\n upanayanam was a very simple affair. Though my father is an orthodox braah=\r\nmana following a very simple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthodox in the=\r\n matter of rituals. Above all, he fearlessly follows his convictions and do=\r\nes not engage in rituals that he does not consider meaningful. He is also a=\r\ngainst following the letter of the rules and breaking the spirit. For examp=\r\nle, when he went to a griha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, they were=\r\n beating a cow to force it to climb stairs to enter the room. People bring =\r\na cow into the room at the time of housewarming, as they consider a cow to =\r\nsymbolize Lakshmi and some steps in the ritual require a cow in the room. A=\r\ns the cow was not happy to climb stairs, they resorted to violence to force=\r\n it. My father was sad to see the suffering of the cow and told them bluntl=\r\ny that they were doing adharma and there was no point in getting a cow in t=\r\nhe\n room like that. But my father puts more value on the spirit of the rule=\r\ns rather than the letter and does not hesitate to speak his mind in front o=\r\nf anybody.\n\nFor my upanayanam, he took me to Lord Venkateswara temple in Ti=\r\nrupati/Tirumala, which is his favorite temple. At the time of muhurta, we w=\r\nere on the hill near the temple. He spent a few hours doing his japam with =\r\nvarious stotras and I also did japam with several stotras. When the muhurta=\r\n came, he simply taught me Gayatri mantra and that was it. No rituals of an=\r\ny kind were performed, except for japam for a few hours.\n\nIn my opinion, su=\r\nch a simple approach is also perfectly fine. The key points are that the pe=\r\nrson giving mantra should have done some sadhana, both of them should be in=\r\n a good and relaxed mood at the time and environment should be peaceful, an=\r\nd, the person receiving mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it later on.=\r\n\n\nIf a businessman opens an account in his son&#39;s name for a new business ve=\r\nnture by the young man, what matters is how much money father gave and how =\r\nwell the son used the money, how he ran the new business and how he grew th=\r\ne money. How big a party was held, how many people came and what activities=\r\n they engaged in is irrelevant in the long run.\n\n* * *\n\nMy purpose is not t=\r\no discourage elaborate rituals. Do them if there is social pressure to do s=\r\no or you find them interesting. But, atleast ensure that mantropadesa happe=\r\nns peacefully and correctly. More importantly, ensure that the young man do=\r\nes some sadhana with Gayatri mantra everyday, after upanayanam.\n\nAlso, it i=\r\ns perfectly acceptable (and beneficial) to initiate the young person into h=\r\nomam after upanayanam is done. On the same day or a few days later, one can=\r\n teach a simple version of Ganapathi homam and let the young person perform=\r\n it by oneself during weekends or so. One can start off with the super-shor=\r\nt procedure and slowly add things. Doing Gayatri mantra everyday and homam =\r\nnow and then will accelerate the spiritual evolution of the young person.\n\n=\r\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n\n---- Sunitha &lt;sunitha_macherla@...&gt; wr=\r\note: \n&gt; Namaskaram Narasimha garu, Can the homam performed during upanayana=\r\nm be done using only coconuts and nuts?

The key points are that the person givi=\r\nng mantra should have done some\n sadhana, both of them should be in a good =\r\nand relaxed mood at the time and environment should be peaceful, and, the p=\r\nerson receiving mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it later on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nIf a businessman opens an account in his son&#39;s name for a new business vent=\r\nure by the young man, what matters is how much money father gave and how we=\r\nll the son used the money, how he ran the new business and how he grew the =\r\nmoney. How big a party was held, how many people came and what activities t=\r\nhey engaged in is irrelevant in the long run.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My purpos=\r\ne is not to discourage elaborate rituals. Do them if there is social pressu=\r\nre to do so or you find them interesting. But, atleast ensure that mantropa=\r\ndesa happens peacefully and correctly. More importantly, ensure that the yo=\r\nung man does some sadhana with Gayatri mantra everyday, after upanayanam.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, it is perfectly acceptable (and beneficial) to initiate the you=\r\nng person into homam\n after upanayanam is done. On the same day or a few da=\r\nys later, one can teach a simple version of Ganapathi homam and let the you=\r\nng person perform it by oneself during weekends or so. One can start off wi=\r\nth the super-short procedure and slowly add things. Doing Gayatri mantra ev=\r\neryday and homam now and then will accelerate the spiritual evolution of th=\r\ne young person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that =\r\nmake a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- Sunitha &lt;&lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dsunitha_macherla%40yahoo=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:sunitha_macherla%40y=\r\nahoo.com&quot;&gt;sunitha_macherla@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaskaram Nar=\r\nasimha garu, Can the homam performed during upanayanam be done using only c=\r\noconuts and nuts?
