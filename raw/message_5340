This is possible only with \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\ndiet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain=\r\n \n&gt; would not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it not bee=\r\nn for \n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; c) The gu=\r\nt morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally \n&gt; equidistant=\r\n from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because \n&gt; humans a=\r\nre designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and \n&gt; rum=\r\nen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant \n&gt; =\r\ncellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82 major part of the leafy=\r\n \n&gt;vegetable \n&gt;\n&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other h=\r\nand, the stomach \n&gt;lining \n&gt;\n&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82  the kind of =\r\nstrong acids which is present in a \n&gt;typical \n&gt;\n&gt; carnivore. This is becaus=\r\ne, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82  the natural \n&gt;\n&gt; process of=\r\n evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may further interest you \n\n&gt; to=\r\n know that the teeth structure of humans is actually identical to, guess \n&gt;=\r\nwhat, \n&gt;\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n&gt; \n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconc=\r\nieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82 research into \n&gt; clinical nutrition ver=\r\ny clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human \n\n&gt; body for=C3=82=\r\n w.r.t different foods=C3=82 is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for \n&gt;fi=\r\nsh, \n&gt;\n&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considere=\r\nd negative \n&gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calori=\r\nes in absorving it \n&gt;\n&gt; than the amount it gains from them.

Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetabl=\r\nes as well. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human society. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved i=\r\ndeas and look at REAL &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; research in the most unbiased way possible,=\r\n and accessed scientific papers in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutrition and dieteti=\r\ncs, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ample evidence th=\r\nat humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; om=\r\nnivorous diet:-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substan=\r\ntially approximately four to five &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; million years ago with major cl=\r\nimatic changes creating open grassland &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; environments. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller,=\r\n simpler &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82&nbsp; requiring=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\nfoods based around meat protein and fat. For &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; example since the ti=\r\nme of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; years=\r\n ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possibl=\r\ne only with a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in=\r\n layman terms, our brain &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; would not have reached the size and mass=\r\n as it is today, had it not been for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fru=\r\nits and vegetables. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; c) The gut morphology of =\r\nthe human body as it stand todays is ideally &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; equidistant from tha=\r\nt of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; humans are=\r\n designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plan=\r\nt &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82&nbsp;major =\r\npart of the leafy vegetable &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roug=\r\nhage. On the other hand, the stomach lining &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of humans do not cont=\r\nain=C3=82&nbsp; the kind of strong acids which is present in a typical &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; the natural &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be omni=\r\nvorous. It may further interest you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to know that the teeth struct=\r\nure of humans is actually identical to, guess what, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rats who also=\r\n are omnivores.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and =\r\nmistaken ideas that=C3=82&nbsp;research into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutrition v=\r\nery clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; body f=\r\nor=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t different foods=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (not vegetables o=\r\nr fruits) for fish, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact t=\r\nhe later is considered negative &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; calorie food, since it requires t=\r\nhe body to waste more calories in absorving it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; than the amount it=\r\n gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. You can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; look =\r\nup actual BV (biological value)=C3=82&nbsp;charts for more details.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; All this is science. Real science. If you are interested, pleas=\r\ne do study actual &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; scientific papers with an objective mind, but d=\r\no not pass judgements based on &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lack of study or motivated=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;hearsay. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbs=\r\np;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From the point of view of sadhana, as per my=\r\n personal experience,=C3=82&nbsp;it is best to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; eat as light a foo=\r\nd as possible. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Spicy foods are more disturbin=\r\ng than nonvegeterian foods, therefore the best is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; totally=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;bland food.=C3=82&nbsp;Eating exactly the same food daily for months on=\r\n end is also &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; very helpful to disengaging the mind from food. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Feel free to stick to your preferred eating habit=\r\ns, but kindly do not use &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; incorrect scientific arguments to futher=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;some preconceived agenda. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regard=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ____=\r\n____________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From: SARA RAJU &lt;saraus2001@...&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Mon, 29 November, 2010 10:1=\r\n1:42 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] IS NON VEG FOOD BAD FOR MEN?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rajmohanji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Saatwic foods naturally creating good moral habits and maintain our body =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; metabolisim very well.
