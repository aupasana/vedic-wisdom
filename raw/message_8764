I did not do =\r\nit eventually though but your post is a kind of confirmation signal for me =\r\natleast. Narasimha Garu normally indicates that whatever one offer in Ahuti=\r\n should not be completely dry. once he suggested me that if i offer Cowdung=\r\n cakes as Ahuti, then i dhould dip that in ghee and offer. so this thing is=\r\n very clear.\n\n2ndly, I wish to understand about &quot;Chandi Path verses&quot; which =\r\nare recited while offering Ahuti iN Chandi Homas. How one ought to apply th=\r\ne rule of 10:1 or 100:1 in such cases? any Idea you have or you can get?\n\nT=\r\nhank you again for the post and Happy Durgaashtami to all!\n\nBest Regards,\n\n=\r\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikanth&quot; &lt;ashutosh.s=\r\nrikanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; I have been performing weekly =\r\nhavan for more than a year and half.\n&gt; I want to point out certain things r=\r\nelated to havan so that it can be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; I am=\r\n using a conversation that in fact took place to bring out these relevant p=\r\noints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summar=\r\ny I am presenting below: \n&gt; \n&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with simila=\r\nr &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - c=\r\nalled as dosha.]\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm..=\r\n. let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni ka=\r\nrya at your home regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised=\r\n by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the havan I =\r\ndid at home)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni k=\r\narya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahu=\r\nti does not seem to be right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds=\r\n).\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of=\r\n ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in =\r\nmy ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa b=\r\nefore giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you =\r\nuse for your regular japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a =\r\npre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; Pra=\r\nshNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is f=\r\nor every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified f=\r\nor one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recita=\r\ntions of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; \n&gt; Mysel=\r\nf: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore b=\r\nook - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that book series)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular=\r\n chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You ha=\r\nve to follow it strictly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The conversation went onto several other thi=\r\nngs. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer=\r\n and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in ho=\r\nmam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my =\r\nspiritual progress since. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this gr=\r\noup agree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting=\r\n everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti t=\r\no get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
