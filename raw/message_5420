Don&#39;t worry too much and keep doing whatever you can. Nothing goes waste.\n \nRegarding Priya&#39;s question, most people will need multiple births. The best is to stop thinking about when and how one makes progress and gets liberated. One who just keeps doing sadhana without such extraneous thoughts is very lucky and will make progress faster than one who constantly thinks of when results come and whether one is progressing.\n \nA cricket batsman who says &quot;I must hit this ball for a four&quot; puts pressure and keeps missing balls or may even get out. One who does not care about when four runs come, when six runs come, when single comes, when no runs come, will just look at the ball and play it. This cool approach will maximize the chance of getting a four. One putting pressure on oneself may miss the opportunity when it comes!\n \nUltimately, even desire of liberation blocks one from liberation. In fact, liberation is not getting X or Y or Z. It is *dropping* attraction (and aversion) to various things. If one has a notion in the mind that there is something desirable called &quot;liberation&quot;, one is not free. One needs to somehow pursue that notion! However, in the beginning, one needs to have that notion and pursue. But a stage should come when one does so many things but not think about results and does not want this or that.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- manish gour &lt;manishgo_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In addition to that\n&gt;\n&gt; How do we ensure that the start we have taken in this birth(doing homam,japam\n&gt; etc) is utilized in next birth ( if we have to take next birth) and continue\n&gt; with the same activities\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: prm7782 &lt;prm7782@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thu, 9 December, 2010 1:54:53 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] question about spiritual progress...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram Narsimhagaru,\n&gt;\n&gt; You had mentioned that for some...after doing homam karmic cleansing can be\n&gt; months, for some years and for some lifetime. So obviously a person who\n&gt; undergoes karmic cleansing for lifetime doesn&#39;t get much spiritual progress.\n&gt; Does it mean that person also doesn&#39;t attain salvation or merge with God in this\n&gt; birth? Will he have to take rebirth to finish the leftover job?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks for helping me come so far..\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Priya\n\n\n"}}
