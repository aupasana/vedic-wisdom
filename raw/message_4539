One can=\r\nnot talk about nothing, for\nnothing is the total lack of experience,  obliv=\r\nion; like being switched\noff, dead, gone, annihilated.  But after a non dur=\r\nation of time there\nwas a re-emergence or resurrection of my being, an anni=\r\nhilation of\nannihilation as such; but the like of which could never be drea=\r\nmed or\nimagined.  No physical eye has ever seen that place, no hand has tou=\r\nched\nit, no dreaming mind has thought of it, and its reality has never\noccu=\r\nrred to the rational mind which exists in temporality: other than\nthrough t=\r\nhe memory of the Paradise event itself.\n\nAnnihilation in that mutual conver=\r\ngence was something like passing\nthrough a magic gate: a gap in the univers=\r\ne: a hole in creation, a gate\nwhich separates time and temporal things from=\r\n the transcendent realm of\na divine Eternity, the repose of being.  Such de=\r\nath is not a death but\nrather the ultimate in living, the ultimate in knowi=\r\nng, and the ultimate\nin comprehension and affirmation.  Likewise is it the =\r\nultimate in love,\npassion, wisdom, and understanding.  From hindsight one w=\r\nould initially\nask the question as to why the nature of things comes to con=\r\ntain such a\nrare and precious jewel in the crown of creation which would se=\r\nem to be\nso jealously guarded, and beyond the moat of annihilation itself, =\r\nthat\nso few people ever come to see it during the course of their life on\nE=\r\narth.  A justified question indeed.  For everyone should know this yet\nwhil=\r\ne they live their lives on Earth; or so would be my own judgement\nand any o=\r\nther human being who had come to witness this wonder beyond all\nwonders.\n\nD=\r\nialogue upon the transcendent and eternal realm is not going to be easy\nfor=\r\n the words we use apply to temporal things and not to the eternal\nperceptio=\r\nn of the transcendent realm of perfection in which there is\nknowledge only =\r\nof essences of things and not the things themselves. \nMoreover the vision o=\r\nf the place itself is not what that realm is all\nabout, for it is about the=\r\n feeling and the knowing and understanding,\nnot the vision; and even though=\r\n the vision itself is the vision to end\nall visions.  Among all other thing=\r\ns one knows (and realises from\nhindsight) is that we are a kind of jug, a v=\r\nessel, a conduit, through\nwhich the life force itself flows.  Without creat=\r\ned consciousness to act\nas such vessels there could be no further creation,=\r\n and no point or\nmeaning to creation without us.  We are the banks of the r=\r\niver of the\nflow of life; and this place is where the banks of the river of=\r\n life\nmeet the eternal river-bed.\n\nHowever, it is not totally impossible to=\r\n talk of such reality, only very\ndifficult; but such experience itself solv=\r\nes many mysteries and so\ncalled paradoxes.  To say that self consciousness,=\r\n or I, is resurrected\nafter annihilation is the most fitting description of=\r\n the experience,\nand the best definition of the event.  One could also say =\r\nthe\nannihilation of annihilation; but one cannot say as to what is happenin=\r\ng\nin absolute objective terms of reality; for you and I can never know\nthat=\r\n.  With regards to the `awakening&#39; in that realm then one\ncannot make an an=\r\nalogy of going to sleep and then waking up in another\nplace, for that gives=\r\n the impression of a continuity; which it is not. \nIt is a broken continuit=\r\ny of self being.  Broken by the act of\nannihilation.\n\nWhen we awake from sl=\r\neep we are the same person that went to sleep; we\nvaguely remember going to=\r\n sleep, we remember having been to sleep, and\nwhen we awake we retain our p=\r\nast memories of having existed before that\nsleep: and thus a continuity of =\r\nbeing even though we underwent an\noblivion of consciousness during dreamles=\r\ns sleep.  Neither are we\nactually aware of the point of falling asleep, but=\r\n we sure are aware of\nbeing annihilated; and how.  And I often wondered why=\r\n.  But if we did\nnot come to know then we would never know the connection p=\r\noint between\ntime and the everlasting eternal moment of being.\n\nBecause tha=\r\nt place, the transcendent realm, is judged by us (or me) to\nbe perfection, =\r\nthen for simplicity I refer to it as Paradise.  There are\nno names however.=\r\n  It would be misleading to refer to it as\n`eternity&#39;, for I always thought=\r\n of eternity as the sum of all\ncreated time.  Indeed time as we know it doe=\r\ns not even move there.  Thus\nit is the beginning of time; hence the womb of=\r\n eternity.  Moreover,\nnothing at all of experienced consciousness has ever =\r\nknown that place\nand dimension by dwelling there.  So it is pristine, fresh=\r\n, child like,\nvirgin of any other experience or memory; and hence my justif=\r\nication for\nreferring to it as the Virgin Womb of Eternity.  There are no m=\r\nen or\nwomen there and the word virgin has no connotations of that ilk. \nHow=\r\never, let us proceed with the event and the understanding of the\neternal wi=\r\nsdom itself.\n\nWhen we awake in paradise we do not awake in the sense of com=\r\ning out of\na sleep then; it is nothing like that at all.  There is no wakin=\r\ng up or\nsleeping in that realm, for when you are resurrected into it you ha=\r\nve\nALWAYS been there; there is no before.  Temporality does not apply\nthere=\r\n.  Hence, even if we went there a million times it would always be\n`once&#39; f=\r\nrom our perception anyway; and by virtue of annihilation\nitself and which b=\r\nrings cosmic amnesia.  Paradise is the beginning; and\nthe end is a new begi=\r\nnning.  So it is both the beginning and the end,\nand then the beginning aga=\r\nin.  It is like the knot that joins a round\npiece of string or loop; or the=\r\n weld that holds the circle of being\ntogether.  It is home; back to from wh=\r\nence we came.  It is my home;\neveryone&#39;s home.  We are Twins; divine cosmic=\r\n twins.\n\nOne does not wake up then or suddenly come into self consciousness=\r\n there\nfor one has always been there and self conscious within it.  Natural=\r\nly\nenough you and I can come to question that truth as it is experienced by=\r\n\nthe I AM within that realm when we are in extension of it; and don&#39;t\nI kno=\r\nw it. But one cannot question it whilst in there; it is\nuncontradictable. T=\r\nhus when self consciousness is restored, shall we\nsay, after annihilation, =\r\nit is not the restoration of the personality\nthat went in, thus it is not r=\r\neally a resurrection in that sense, for\nthat part of ourselves which exists=\r\n in that realm has always been there;\nand  the part, the personality, that =\r\nwent into annihilation does not\nexist there; but it is still you; the real =\r\nyou; the essential you; but\nthe inner and depth eternal you that only this =\r\ndimension can reveal; and\nhold.  The part that is never let go of.  So much=\r\n depends then on the\nreference point one is talking from when using the ter=\r\nm `I&#39; or\nme.  Hence we have to come to know our true self; that part which =\r\nIS the\nreal us, and of which everything else is ultimately objective - even=\r\n the\npersonality, time and changing events.\n\nIn that realm there is no memo=\r\nry of ever having existed before or\nelsewhere.  There is no before or elsew=\r\nhere. Thus we are not talking\nabout the personality existing in paradise bu=\r\nt that of the PERSON.  The\npersonality is washed away in annihilation (much=\r\n like mud coming off\ncloths in the wash).  But nevertheless that person in =\r\nparadise is\n`ME&#39;... `I AM ME&#39;.   It is still my essential being and\nconscio=\r\nusness (you in your case).  But not the you of the temporal\nsenses and pers=\r\nonality.  The person and the personality are but two\nparts of our trinity o=\r\nf incarnate being; and the soul (data field) or\noverself is the third part =\r\n- like three quarks in a proton or three peas\nin a pod: Spirit, Soul and Pe=\r\nrsonality.  One could therefore mistakenly\ntalk about the `I AM&#39; which exis=\r\nts in the womb of eternal mind\nas being objective from the personality of t=\r\nhe being in time and space;\nbut to do so would be very wrong and also cause=\r\n a paradox and an\nalienation of self from self, or the outer from the inner=\r\n.  Likewise it\nis also too painfully obvious from hindsight that some, if n=\r\not many\n(through second hand dialogue and distortions) have thought this as=\r\npect\nof being to be the first cause; the unseen living mover of creation\nit=\r\nself.  But not so; for there is something else, and even beyond that\ndepth.=\r\n.. beyond our transcendent self, and which is not us. But those\nwho have cl=\r\naimed or believed that they and the creative source of all\nexistence are th=\r\ne same thing are utterly wrong. And so too are those who\nbelieved them.  Bu=\r\nt that is more politics and manipulation than reality\nas was.\n\nThe eternal =\r\nparadise at the ground of our being is experienced to be the\nfirst created =\r\nthing and place; but certainly not the creative source\nitself.  Although it=\r\n is known to be the first emanation of the creative\nsource itself, the firs=\r\nt act of creation (the son of creation in\nanalogy).  In the beginning man w=\r\nas indeed in a `garden&#39; (realm)\nof eternal delight and everlasting perfecti=\r\non; a paradise existence\nindeed.  But as I say, it would still require an `=\r\nact&#39; to bring\nforth that realm and the mind/s within it.  Thus it is also k=\r\nnown whilst\nin that place that there is a deeper but uncreated reality.  Bu=\r\nt not a\ndeeper reality that you or I can ever get to; and that is a known f=\r\nact\nwhilst there.  The I AM which exists in that reality is not the first\nc=\r\nause then, and that is axiomatic at the time.  It is the first thing\n`CAUSE=\r\nD&#39;; the original observer of the observed.  However, it\nwas not created in =\r\ntime; certainly not the kind of space-time that you\nand I know out here.  I=\r\nt is deeper down within the inner structure of\nthe vortex of emanation than=\r\n the point where space times become a\nphenomenon of extended manifest reali=\r\nty; just as a river is not the\nriver bed, but without a river bed and the b=\r\nanks there could be no\nriver.  It is the ground of being; not the creative =\r\nsource of all being.\nAnd there is a deeper reality which can never be known=\r\n; it can only be\nknown of.\n\nLet us continue however, with the event as it u=\r\nnfolded.  I was\nresurrected from oblivion, non existence, conscious death, =\r\ninto a place\nof eternal perfection.  In that place there is perfect vision,=\r\n (those\nwho are blind will see).  A vision which must be from two locations=\r\n I\nguess because the vision, the place, is three dimensional; binocular\nvis=\r\nion.  There exists width, breadth, and depth.\n\nThe place, realm, goes on as=\r\n far as one can see, and into a distance\nbeyond sight itself, for it is eve=\r\nrywhere and everything.  There is up,\nand there is down, there is left and =\r\nthere is right, all relative to the\npoint of vision needless to say.  The v=\r\nision is of darkness and of\ninfinite jewel like little glowing lights.  The=\r\n lights are like jewels,\ndiamonds set in a sea of purple glowing darkness; =\r\nwhich is not really\ndark at all, but somehow pulsating with vitality and be=\r\ning.  The lights\nare small but more than mere points of light, and they are=\r\n of various\nsize and distance apart.  Some are even kind of wispy and strun=\r\ng out;\nbut most are round-ish.\n\nNeither the darkness or the lights can be d=\r\nescribed in a way which does\nthem justice, for the beauty transcends anythi=\r\nng known or knowable in\ntemporal consciousness.  It is the original unadult=\r\nerated essence and\nprinciple of beauty.  The lights in that realm are stati=\r\nonary, or so it\nseems to observation.  Nothing moves, all is still and sile=\r\nnt.  The only\nthing that moves is I, or self consciousness.  I AM slowly dr=\r\nifts\nthrough that realm in a clockwise orbit; a slow orbit, but an orbit\nne=\r\nvertheless.  Initially it is like a slow drifting in a straight line. \nHowe=\r\nver, it is an orbit, a clockwise orbit assuming the clock were\nlaying face =\r\nup on the floor.  The orbit is of great distance and almost\nperceived as a =\r\nstraight line, but it is known to be an orbit about an\nunseen `missing&#39; cen=\r\ntre.  The I that exists there (us) has no\nperceived substance or form, it i=\r\ns just pure virgin primordial\nconsciousness as far as we are concerned; or =\r\na mysterious substance\nwhich can be made conscious; a cognitive energy of s=\r\nome kind.  But what\nit is made of (if anything other than pure consciousnes=\r\ns) cannot be\nknown.  It cannot be seen or touched.  We cannot see our Self.=\r\n\n\nIt is like such energy is sacrosanct.  There is no form to the eyes that\n=\r\nsee, for it is the consciousness or energy itself which can see.  It can\nse=\r\ne almost all the way around itself, but not quite all the way around. \nThus=\r\n you cannot see directly behind you but you can indeed see well to\nthe left=\r\n and right in greater vision than human vision.  In ones\ndrifting in this p=\r\nlace one does not come into contact with the distant\nlights at all; and one=\r\n does not really know as to what the lights are\nwhilst there, (one can dedu=\r\nce from hindsight though) they are just\nlights, beautiful lights, and their=\r\n configuration slowly alters with the\nperspective of ones movement in orbit=\r\n.  (Later I wondered as to how\nthere could be perceived movement but no per=\r\nceived experience of time\n=96 but that is how it is).\n\nThe darkness itself =\r\nis indescribable, it is like a translucent glow of\npurple soup stuff which =\r\nis somehow vibrant, vital, it is not a void and\nit is not mere space in bet=\r\nween the lights; it is a `something&#39;;\nbut more like a glowing soup or aura =\r\nsomehow.  Perhaps it is the\n`stuff&#39; that beings `congeal&#39; out of; like plan=\r\nets and\nstars do in the physical universe.   And ones orbit is through this=\r\n\ndivine and wondrous darkness-stuff amid the jewel like lights.  Thus, it\ni=\r\ns a brightness as well as a darkness.  Like the twilight of the\nproverbial =\r\ngods indeed.  The description may make it sound a little bit\nlike the physi=\r\ncal universe with the stars amid black space; but it is\nnothing like that a=\r\nt all.  But if anything then more like the vision\ntelescopes see among a br=\r\night nebula in a past supernova.\n\nThe lights are also much larger than our =\r\nperception of stars which are\nmere pin pricks of light, and there is a tint=\r\n of colour in them even, as\nI say, like diamonds; but the predominant aura =\r\nand glow is white.  They\nhave a substance and shape, but there seems to be =\r\nno absolute uniformity\nof shape; but most seem to be round as I say.  The d=\r\narkness is nothing\nlike outer space then, and it is not even dark at all; b=\r\nut dark-ish,\nlike purple soup which is glowing.  The lights are not as dist=\r\nant as the\nstars in space even though they are not in contact, and the dist=\r\nances\nbetween them is many times their actual size.  Thus it is not like th=\r\ne\nemptiness of outer space at all.  Moreover, one can see all this without\n=\r\nturning ones vision, for indeed one cannot turn ones vision.  There is\nno `=\r\nOh, I think I will look that way or this way&#39;... you just\nsee it all, all t=\r\nhe time.  But you also know that you are not seeing\n`it all&#39; at all, for it=\r\n is infinite and everywhere.\n\nHowever, that realm is not about the vision a=\r\ns I say, it is about the\nmagic; the knowing, the understanding, the passion=\r\n, the reality, the\nknowing the essence of the `ALL&#39;, the love, the wisdom, =\r\nthe\nbeauty, and above all else it is about the purpose of creation and\nbein=\r\ng.  It is ineffable really.  In a word it is all about `being\nthere&#39;; takin=\r\ng part in this wondrous mysterious union of creation at\nroot beyond time.  =\r\nIt seems that the vision itself is a kind of bonus\nperhaps: a place in whic=\r\nh to do this knowing yet whilst in a repose of\ndivine peace; the peace whic=\r\nh passes all absolute understanding; utter\nperfection, and absolute affirma=\r\ntion of being.  It is like an amen to\ncreation; the swan song of perfection=\r\n.  It is like the last chord of the\nultimate piece of perfect music; a chor=\r\nd which comes like an amen after\nthat pregnant pause and build up to the fi=\r\nnal chord.  There could be\nnothing cleverer and wiser than to have annihila=\r\ntion precede this\nreality; for it is like music in that sense; the last, an=\r\nd wondrous\nchord of created being when all has seemed to be done and finish=\r\ned.  And\nwhilst also being seen from hindsight to be the prelude to being a=\r\nlso.\nThe first and last chord of the music of the spheres and the dance and=\r\n\nsymphony of creation and being.\n\nMoreover, it is also the beginning as wel=\r\nl as the end, as I say, for it\nis where we come from, the root of our being=\r\n.  It is like it could be\ndescribed as the cosmological waiting room of cre=\r\nated consciousness\nbefore transmigration into the experience of time, freed=\r\nom and activity.\nThere are no other beings perceived (or even known of) in =\r\nthat realm;\none is totally alone with this truth and its reality.  Thus the=\r\n place\nand the knowledge is all yours, all mine, all beings from their poin=\r\nt of\nreference and consciousness; it is the realm where all centres meet\nbe=\r\nyond space and time in the primordial motherload of created\nconsciousness, =\r\nminds, beings, whatever you want to call them. \n`Motherload&#39; does not mean =\r\nfemale either.  It means the main\nseam; the core, and the pure original stu=\r\nff itself.  It is PURE\nconsciousness; beyond time, space, and memory.  It (=\r\nI AM) is the alpha\nand omega of all extended minds; the beginning and the e=\r\nnd of all\ncreated beings in creation; the first creation and the home that =\r\nawaits\nthe return of all created minds which are but the children or progen=\r\ny of\ncreation.\n\nNothing was created before I AM and paradise: and nothing i=\r\ns created\nafter me; I am the beginning and the end of creation, (synetic\ndi=\r\nalogue).  Thus it is that the consciousness in the repose of the\neternal do=\r\nmain is the first child of creation - in the Virgin Birth of\ncreation itsel=\r\nf.  The real and only Virgin Birth. (and this one is not\nsymbolic, it is th=\r\ne real thing).  Before the mountains high and wide,\nbefore the sea&#39;s did fl=\r\now, before the stars gave forth their light,\neven then, I said, I KNOW.  Be=\r\nfore my personality was, I AM.  Before\ncave men came into being, I AM.  Loo=\r\nk deeper than the stones of the\nearth and the oceans, and there you will fi=\r\nnd me; I am the light which\nis beyond them all; I am the light of life and =\r\nthe resurrection.  Know\nme, and you will know your self; for I AM... and yo=\r\nu are I AM.\n\nThus it is not really metaphysics but proto-physics; before ph=\r\nysics.  It\nis not `after time&#39; (although it is that again also) it is\nbefor=\r\ne time moved; before changing events emanated forth from the centre\nof all =\r\nbeing and the eternal point of no duration.  We are there at the\nbeginning,=\r\n like the first observer of the first act of creation; in awe,\npassion, and=\r\n wisdom. We are the lover of the loved.   We are the\nmanifestation of cosmi=\r\nc love and beauty. And no extended manifest life\ncan be without me (I AM).\n=\r\n\nOur self consciousness in that dimension cannot think; thinking is a\ntempo=\r\nral process; thinking needs time. But it is totally aware\nnevertheless, (th=\r\nus, knowledge and understanding comes before thought:\nthus thought depends =\r\non knowledge... NOT the other way around as many\nseem to assume.  Earthly p=\r\nhilosophers are like mere babies in divine\ncosmic ignorance).  It (we) is (=\r\nare) not aware of things as we are aware\nof things out here however, but it=\r\n is aware of what can only be\ndescribed as the essences and eternal princip=\r\nles and qualities of\nthings; truths; depth realities; quality; meaning; pur=\r\npose; beauty;\nwisdom; passion; understanding and affirmation.  It is the bi=\r\ng YES to\ncreation and conscious existence; TO BE.\n\nThat root of our being o=\r\nf eternal consciousness, that part of ourselves\nwhich exists there at the d=\r\neepest level, the first child of creation, is\ntotally in absolute love, a p=\r\nassion beyond description, imagination and\nbeliefs.  It is filled with the =\r\npassion of being to such a degree that\nif you and I out here were to have t=\r\nhat degree of passion energy burning\ninside of our temporal minds or guts t=\r\nhen we would blow up; (and perhaps\nthis caused it to happen during an incar=\r\nnate life; who knows, who indeed\nknows); but such passion is like dynamite.=\r\n  It is not like the watered\ndown love we know in this world, and certainly=\r\n wonderful though that be.\nIt is more comparable to the heat at the big ban=\r\ng with that of absolute\nCosmic temperature now.\n\nIn this life we tend to th=\r\nink of wisdom as that of knowing what to do,\nof doing the right and proper =\r\nthing; because it is wise to do that thing\nby virtue of the positive outcom=\r\ne. But that is intelligence and reason,\nnot wisdom.  However, the wisdom wi=\r\nthin that consciousness is nothing\nlike that.  Its wisdom is the knowledge =\r\nof creation itself; the\nknowledge of the heart: the knowledge of itself and=\r\n its eternal\nexistence; and as to why things exist at all.  Knowledge also =\r\nof that\nwhich is not itself; but otherness; that which gave event to this\np=\r\naradise and oneself; it is uncontradictable certainty of creation;\npurpose;=\r\n being; and the wisdom of the beginning and the end of all\nthings.  And the=\r\nnce all of which I sum up in the terms the `Eternal\nGnosis&#39; or the `Eternal=\r\n Wisdom&#39;.\n\nIt is a divine swoon of the exultation of the love of being; and=\r\n being a\npart of it all.  That `I AM&#39; knows well enough that something\nbrou=\r\nght it forth into conscious being; it knows well enough that it does\nnot co=\r\nntain its own causation.   It also knows that the cause of its\nexistence is=\r\n not paradise itself (the place) in its origin; and not\nwithin paradise its=\r\nelf in absolute terms.  The first cause cannot be\nseen, it cannot be direct=\r\nly known independent of the essences and\ncreated forms, and yet in a way it=\r\n knows of nothing else other than its\nlove for its source of being.  And it=\r\ns source of being is that of no\ncreated thing; no thing created; and no `th=\r\ning&#39; knowable.  And\nit is not questionable; it is uncontradictable knowledg=\r\ne and certain\nreality.  There is no doubt.\n\nThus, if it could be said that =\r\none is `contemplating&#39; whilst\nthere, which is true in a way, then the thing=\r\n which one is concentrating\non, knowing, cognitive of (not thinking) in thi=\r\ns swoon of passion,\nknowledge and delight is that of the love of and for  `=\r\nNo Created\nThing&#39;. If you follow my meaning.  Everything which is (includin=\r\ng I\nAM) is the manifest flow of the principle of  TO BE.  But the principle=\r\n,\nalthough contained within all things, is no created thing. TO BE, is its\n=\r\nown causation; and the absolute primordial essence and principle of all\ntha=\r\nt becomes manifest in extension of the mysterious and unknowable\npoint of n=\r\no duration.\n\nThus it is that such child of consciousness (us in there) is i=\r\nn love, a\npassion, and wisdom and yet it is but a cosmological child; a vir=\r\ngin\ncreation; a virgin birth no less: pure in its love of otherness and the=\r\n\nlove of itself and its home which was created for it.  Pure in the sense\nt=\r\nhat it cannot think.  Pure in the sense that it has had no other\nexperience=\r\n beyond that of paradise itself.  Pure in its love which is\nunconditional o=\r\nf anything except the passion of TO BE, and unadulterated\nby anything which=\r\n is not it.  For although it somehow knows everything\nin there, you and I (=\r\nout here) would say that it knows nothing at all in\nthe sense that we consi=\r\nder knowledge and understanding things to be.  It\nis a very strange thing, =\r\nfor in this world there are two things that you\nand I can never ever know; =\r\none of them is everything, and the other is\nnothing. (For `knowing&#39; means t=\r\no know `some thing&#39;). \nAnd yet that part of ourselves in that realm knows o=\r\nnly two things: one\nof them is everything (the essence and principle of) an=\r\nd the other is No\nThing.  How odd, how very odd; it is like a reciprocal re=\r\nality, or the\nsquare root of minus one - except that this place exists in r=\r\neality to\nbe known and loved.\n\nThe `I AM&#39; of that realm has no knowledge of=\r\n Earth and incarnate\nexistence.  No knowledge of the universe or universes =\r\nof space and time.\nNo knowledge of created forms other than itself and para=\r\ndise.  Thus,\nthose who claim that they are communicating with the dead or t=\r\notally\ntranscendent are either liars or very confused people - a little\nlea=\r\nrning is a dangerous thing; drink deep or taste not.  They may be\ncommunica=\r\nting with other living beings external of that realm; maybe,\nbut not these =\r\nbeings, not the totally transcendent.  You will not\ndisturb these beings.  =\r\nThey are sacrosanct and belong to something else\nfor that duration; for the=\r\ny are home in the ground of being.\n\nIn that eternal paradise then there is =\r\nonly One, and the one is the all\n(all of us); for we are all identical in i=\r\nt.  THAT stuff is what we are\nin the beginning. It is only from hindsight a=\r\nnd whilst on Earth (with\nremembrance of that level of being) that we can kn=\r\now that all created\nconsciousness sees it that way, and in the same way; th=\r\nus all beings\nperceive the oneness in the divine transcendent realm of perf=\r\nect repose,\nperfect love, and perfect wisdom.\n\nIn that place there is no pa=\r\nin, no worry (no bills to pay) no answering\nto do; no eating, no sleeping, =\r\nno thinking, no memory, no remorse; no\nhopes or desires, no fears; nothing =\r\nnegative.  Thus it is also then a\nMono-Pole reality; all positive and no ne=\r\ngative; (hence no negation). \nAll good, no bad.  All beauty, no ugliness.  =\r\nAll `now&#39;, no past\nor future.  All understanding and affirmation, no doubt =\r\nor unknowing. \nAll answers, no questions.  Good grief almighty, why was any=\r\nthing ever\ncreated so good?  Who knows, who can answer.  Only that child kn=\r\nows; and\nthat is its wisdom - and it is you.  Know your Self.\n\nSearch yours=\r\nelf then; for the quest and passion for the deepest\nknowledge of selfhood a=\r\nnd understanding brings knowledge of the deepest\ndepths of the all. And the=\r\n incarnate effect is amazing and life\nenhancing. For we learn how to walk a=\r\nnd ride on the waves of all\ncreation, and to go with the flow.  In the whol=\r\ne of creation there is\nnothing to cling to, for it is all yours already.\n\n*=\r\n\n\n\n\nAs I drifted in a slow orbit swathed in a love and understanding which\n=\r\nis ineffable, beyond words and rational understanding, in a wisdom which\nis=\r\n beyond dialogue, in a place of eternal and everlasting perfection and\ndeli=\r\nght, I suddenly heard/had a voice or command/communication (or the\nexperien=\r\nce of one) and understood a directive.  I had never heard a\nvoice or comman=\r\nd before in all my existence, and I was in fear and\npanic.  The understandi=\r\nng was ...\n\n&quot;It is now time to go&quot; !\n\nWords cannot begin to describe. I had=\r\n never known communication or words\nor commands before.  I did not know as =\r\nto what was communicating with\nme,  or how or why...  was it me or was it s=\r\nomething else... I began\nthinking... what IS thinking!  There is nothing el=\r\nse, only me!  I did\nnot know what `go&#39; meant, and yet somehow I did begin t=\r\no\nunderstand, and as I began to understand I was in even more fear and\npani=\r\nc, (was I biting from the TREE of knowledge) for there was nowhere\nelse to =\r\ngo; only this place exists.\n\nNo, no, I do not want to go (I do not know how=\r\n I invoked or understood\nsuch communication for I had never communicated wi=\r\nth anything).  But I\nknow not of `go&#39;, this is my home and my love... I can=\r\nnot go ! \n(The first thought... and not by choice).\n\n&quot;It is all well that y=\r\nou must go now, for something out there is in\nneed and you must now be with=\r\n it: do not fear, it is all well that you\nmust go now... now be with it&quot; !\n=\r\n\nThat fear at knowing I was `going&#39; is not possible to put into\nwords; it c=\r\nould not be put into words.  But one knew nothing of other\nthings, or world=\r\ns, or time and space.  Nothing.  Nothing other than\nEternal Paradise.\n\n\n\n\r\n--3-1012429938-5855928381=:6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;

&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;One cannot talk about nothing, for nothing\nis the total lack of experienc=\r\ne,&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;oblivion; like being switched off, dead, gone, annihi=\r\nlated.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But after a non duration of time there was a\nre-e=\r\nmergence or resurrection of my being, an annihilation of annihilation as\nsu=\r\nch; but the like of which could never be dreamed or imagined.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;=\r\n/span&gt;No physical eye has ever seen that place, no\nhand has touched it, no =\r\ndreaming mind has thought of it, and its reality has\nnever occurred to the =\r\nrational mind which exists in temporality: other than\nthrough the memory of=\r\n the Paradise event itself.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text=\r\n-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Annihilation in that mutual\nconvergence was something like=\r\n passing through a magic gate: a gap in the\nuniverse: a hole in creation, a=\r\n gate which separates time and temporal things\nfrom the transcendent realm =\r\nof a divine Eternity, the repose of being.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;

&lt;/span&gt;A justified\nquestion=\r\n indeed.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;For everyone should\nknow this yet while they li=\r\nve their lives on Earth; or so would be my own\njudgement and any other huma=\r\nn being who had come to witness this wonder beyond\nall wonders.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Dia=\r\nlogue upon the transcendent\nand eternal realm is not going to be easy for t=\r\nhe words we use apply to\ntemporal things and not to the eternal perception =\r\nof the transcendent realm of\nperfection in which there is knowledge only of=\r\n essences of things and not the\nthings themselves.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Moreo=\r\nver the vision\nof the place itself is not what that realm is all about, for=\r\n it is about the\nfeeling and the knowing and understanding, not the vision;=\r\n and even though the\nvision itself is the vision to end all visions.&lt;span&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Among all other things one knows (and realises from hindsight)=\r\n is\nthat we are a kind of jug, a vessel, a conduit, through which the life =\r\nforce\nitself flows.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Without created consciousness\nto act=\r\n as such vessels there could be no further creation, and no point or\nmeanin=\r\ng to creation without us.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;We are\nthe banks of the river =\r\nof the flow of life; and this place is where the banks\nof the river of life=\r\n meet the eternal river-bed.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;However, it is not totally\nimposs=\r\nible to talk of such reality, only very difficult; but such experience\nitse=\r\nlf solves many mysteries and so called paradoxes.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;To say=\r\n that self consciousness, or I, is resurrected after\nannihilation is the mo=\r\nst fitting description of the experience, and the best\ndefinition of the ev=\r\nent.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;One could also\nsay the annihilation of annihilation=\r\n; but one cannot say as to what is\nhappening in absolute objective terms of=\r\n reality; for you and I can never know\nthat.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;With regard=\r\ns to the `awakening&#39;\nin that realm then one cannot make an analogy of going=\r\n to sleep and then waking\nup in another place, for that gives the impressio=\r\nn of a continuity; which it is\nnot.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is a broken conti=\r\nnuity of self\nbeing.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Broken by the act of\nannihilation.&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:ju=\r\nstify;&quot;&gt;When we awake from sleep we are\nthe same person that went to sleep;=\r\n we vaguely remember going to sleep, we\nremember having been to sleep, and =\r\nwhen we awake we retain our past memories of\nhaving existed before that sle=\r\nep: and thus a continuity of being even though we\nunderwent an oblivion of =\r\nconsciousness during dreamless sleep.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Neither are we act=\r\nually aware of the point\nof falling asleep, but we sure are aware of being =\r\nannihilated; and how.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And I often wondered why.&lt;span&gt;&nb=\r\nsp; &lt;/span&gt;But if we did not come to know then we would\nnever know the conn=\r\nection point between time and the everlasting eternal moment\nof being.&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Because that pl=\r\nace, the\ntranscendent realm, is judged by us (or me) to be perfection, then=\r\n for\nsimplicity I refer to it as Paradise.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;There are no =\r\nnames however.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It\nwould be misleading to refer to it as =\r\n`eternity&#39;, for I always thought of\neternity as the sum of all created time=\r\n.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;Indeed time as we know it does not even move there.&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thus it is the beginning of time; hence the\nwomb of eterni=\r\nty.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Moreover, nothing at\nall of experienced consciousnes=\r\ns has ever known that place and dimension by\ndwelling there.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;So it is pristine,\nfresh, child like, virgin of any other experience o=\r\nr memory; and hence my\njustification for referring to it as the Virgin Womb=\r\n of Eternity.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;There are no men or women there and the wo=\r\nrd\nvirgin has no connotations of that ilk.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;However, let =\r\nus proceed with the event and the understanding of the\neternal wisdom itsel=\r\nf.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align=\r\n:justify;&quot;&gt;When we awake in paradise we do\nnot awake in the sense of coming=\r\n out of a sleep then; it is nothing like that\nat all.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Th=\r\nere is no waking up or sleeping\nin that realm, for when you are resurrected=\r\n into it you have ALWAYS been there;\nthere is no before.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;Temporality does\nnot apply there.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Hence, even if we wen=\r\nt\nthere a million times it would always be `once&#39; from our perception anywa=\r\ny; and\nby virtue of annihilation itself and which brings cosmic amnesia.&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Paradise is the beginning; and the end is a\nnew beginning.=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;So it is both the\nbeginning and the end, and then the b=\r\neginning again.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is like the knot that joins a round p=\r\niece of string or loop;\nor the weld that holds the circle of being together=\r\n.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is home; back to from whence we came.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;=\r\n/span&gt;It is my home; everyone&#39;s home.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;We are Twins; divi=\r\nne cosmic twins.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;One does not wake up then or\nsuddenly come into se=\r\nlf consciousness there for one has always been there and\nself conscious wit=\r\nhin it.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Naturally\nenough you and I can come to question =\r\nthat truth as it is experienced by the I\nAM within that realm when we are i=\r\nn extension of it; and don&#39;t I know it. But\none cannot question it whilst i=\r\nn there; it is uncontradictable. Thus when self\nconsciousness is restored, =\r\nshall we say, after annihilation, it is not the\nrestoration of the personal=\r\nity that went in, thus it is not really a\nresurrection in that sense, for t=\r\nhat part of ourselves which exists in that\nrealm has always been there; and=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;the\npart, the personality, that went into annihilation =\r\ndoes not exist there; but it\nis still you; the real you; the essential you;=\r\n but the inner and depth eternal\nyou that only this dimension can reveal; a=\r\nnd hold.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The part that is never let go of.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;=\r\n/span&gt;So much depends then on the reference point one is talking from\nwhen =\r\nusing the term `I&#39; or me.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Hence we\nhave to come to know =\r\nour true self; that part which IS the real us, and of\nwhich everything else=\r\n is ultimately objective - even the personality, time and\nchanging events.&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;In that rea=\r\nlm there is no memory\nof ever having existed before or elsewhere.&lt;span&gt;&nbs=\r\np;\n&lt;/span&gt;There is no before or elsewhere. Thus we are not talking about th=\r\ne\npersonality existing in paradise but that of the PERSON.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;The personality is washed away in\nannihilation (much like mud coming off=\r\n cloths in the wash).&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But nevertheless that person in pa=\r\nradise is\n`ME&#39;... `I AM ME&#39;.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is still my\nessent=\r\nial being and consciousness (you in your case).&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But not =\r\nthe you of the temporal senses and personality.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The pers=\r\non and the personality are but two\nparts of our trinity of incarnate being;=\r\n and the soul (data field) or overself\nis the third part - like three quark=\r\ns in a proton or three peas in a pod:\nSpirit, Soul and Personality.&lt;span&gt;&n=\r\nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;One could\ntherefore mistakenly talk about the `I AM&#39; which exis=\r\nts in the womb of eternal\nmind as being objective from the personality of t=\r\nhe being in time and space;\nbut to do so would be very wrong and also cause=\r\n a paradox and an alienation of\nself from self, or the outer from the inner=\r\n.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;Likewise it is also too painfully obvious from hindsig=\r\nht that some, if\nnot many (through second hand dialogue and distortions) ha=\r\nve thought this\naspect of being to be the first cause; the unseen living mo=\r\nver of creation\nitself.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But not so; for there is\nsomethi=\r\nng else, and even beyond that depth... beyond our transcendent self, and\nwh=\r\nich is not us. But those who have claimed or believed that they and the\ncre=\r\native source of all existence are the same thing are utterly wrong. And so =\r\ntoo\nare those who believed them.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But that\nis more politi=\r\ncs and manipulation than reality as was.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The eternal paradise at the\nground of our bei=\r\nng is experienced to be the first created thing and place; but\ncertainly no=\r\nt the creative source itself.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;Although it is known to be=\r\n the first emanation of the creative source\nitself, the first act of creati=\r\non (the son of creation in analogy).&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In the beginning ma=\r\nn was indeed in a\n`garden&#39; (realm) of eternal delight and everlasting perfe=\r\nction; a paradise\nexistence indeed.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But as I say, it\nwou=\r\nld still require an `act&#39; to bring forth that realm and the mind/s within\ni=\r\nt.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thus it is also known whilst in\nthat place that there=\r\n is a deeper but uncreated reality.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But not a deeper rea=\r\nlity that you or I can\never get to; and that is a known fact whilst there.&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The I AM which exists in that reality is not the first c=\r\nause\nthen, and that is axiomatic at the time.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;It is the =\r\nfirst thing `CAUSED&#39;; the original observer of the\nobserved.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;However, it was not created\nin time; certainly not the kind of space-t=\r\nime that you and I know out\nhere.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is deeper down with=\r\nin the\ninner structure of the vortex of emanation than the point where spac=\r\ne times\nbecome a phenomenon of extended manifest reality; just as a river i=\r\ns not the\nriver bed, but without a river bed and the banks there could be n=\r\no river.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is the ground of being; not the creative\nsou=\r\nrce of all being.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And there is a\ndeeper reality which ca=\r\nn never be known; it can only be known of.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal=\r\n&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Let us continue however, with the\nevent as =\r\nit unfolded.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I was resurrected\nfrom oblivion, non existe=\r\nnce, conscious death, into a place of eternal\nperfection.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;In that place there is\nperfect vision, (those who are blind will see).&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;A vision which must be from two locations I guess because =\r\nthe\nvision, the place, is three dimensional; binocular vision.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; =\r\n&lt;/span&gt;There exists width, breadth, and depth.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;o&gt;=\r\n&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;

and one does not really know as to what the lights are\nwhilst=\r\n there, (one can deduce from hindsight though) they are just lights,\nbeauti=\r\nful lights, and their configuration slowly alters with the perspective of\no=\r\nnes movement in orbit.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;

style=3D&quot;text-align:jus=\r\ntify;&quot;&gt;The darkness itself is\nindescribable, it is like a translucent glow =\r\nof purple soup stuff which is\nsomehow vibrant, vital, it is not a void and =\r\nit is not mere space in between\nthe lights; it is a `something&#39;; but more l=\r\nike a glowing soup or aura\nsomehow.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Perhaps it is the `s=\r\ntuff&#39; that\nbeings `congeal&#39; out of; like planets and stars do in the physic=\r\nal\nuniverse.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And ones orbit is through\nthis divine=\r\n and wondrous darkness-stuff amid the jewel like lights.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;Thus, it is a brightness as well as a\ndarkness.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Like th=\r\ne twilight of the\nproverbial gods indeed.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The descriptio=\r\nn\nmay make it sound a little bit like the physical universe with the stars =\r\namid\nblack space; but it is nothing like that at all.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Bu=\r\nt if anything then more like the vision telescopes see among a\nbright nebul=\r\na in a past supernova.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The lights are also much larger\nthan our per=\r\nception of stars which are mere pin pricks of light, and there is a\ntint of=\r\n colour in them even, as I say, like diamonds; but the predominant aura\nand=\r\n glow is white.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They have a\nsubstance and shape, but the=\r\nre seems to be no absolute uniformity of shape; but\nmost seem to be round a=\r\ns I say.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The\ndarkness is nothing like outer space then, =\r\nand it is not even dark at all; but\ndark-ish, like purple soup which is glo=\r\nwing.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;The lights are not as distant as the stars in spac=\r\ne even though they are\nnot in contact, and the distances between them is ma=\r\nny times their actual\nsize.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thus it is not like the empt=\r\niness\nof outer space at all.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Moreover, one\ncan see all t=\r\nhis without turning ones vision, for indeed one cannot turn ones\nvision.&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;There is no `Oh, I think I will\nlook that way or this way&#39;=\r\n... you just see it all, all the time.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But you also know=\r\n that you are not seeing\n`it all&#39;

the knowing, the understanding, the\npassion, the reality, the k=\r\nnowing the essence of the `ALL&#39;, the love, the\nwisdom, the beauty, and abov=\r\ne all else it is about the purpose of creation and\nbeing.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;

&lt;/span&gt;It seems that the vision itself\nis a kind=\r\n of bonus perhaps: a place in which to do this knowing yet whilst in a\nrepo=\r\nse of divine peace; the peace which passes all absolute understanding;\nutte=\r\nr perfection, and absolute affirmation of being.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is l=\r\nike an amen to creation; the swan song of perfection.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It=\r\n is like the last chord of the ultimate\npiece of perfect music; a chord whi=\r\nch comes like an amen after that pregnant\npause and build up to the final c=\r\nhord.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;There could be nothing cleverer and wiser than to =\r\nhave annihilation\nprecede this reality;

(For `knowing&#39; means to know =\r\n`some\nthing&#39;).&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And yet that part of ourselves\nin that re=\r\nalm knows only two things: one of them is everything (the essence and\nprinc=\r\niple of) and the other is No Thing.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;How odd, how very od=\r\nd; it is like a reciprocal reality, or the square\nroot of minus one - excep=\r\nt that this place exists in reality to be known and\nloved.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The `I AM&#39; of that realm ha=\r\ns no\nknowledge of Earth and incarnate existence.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;No know=\r\nledge of the universe or universes of space and time.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;No=\r\n knowledge of created forms other than\nitself and paradise.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;Thus, those who\nclaim that they are communicating with the dead or tota=\r\nlly transcendent are\neither liars or very confused people - a little learni=\r\nng is a dangerous thing;\ndrink deep or taste not.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They m=\r\nay be\ncommunicating with other living beings external of that realm; maybe,=\r\n but not\nthese beings, not the totally transcendent.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;You=\r\n will not disturb these beings.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;/span&gt;They are sacrosanct and =\r\nbelong to something else for that duration; for\nthey are home in the ground=\r\n of being.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;=\r\nIn that eternal paradise then\nthere is only One, and the one is the all (al=\r\nl of us); for we are all identical\nin it.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;THAT stuff is =\r\nwhat we are in the\nbeginning.
