H=\r\ne had \n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; nobler tasks to concentrate his energies on. So we need =\r\nnot rely \n&gt; on his\n&gt; &gt; judgement/opinions on these matters\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) The =\r\noriginal names were &#39;suyOdhan, sushAsan&#39; etc. The &#39;du&#39; \n&gt; prefix was\n&gt; &gt; su=\r\nbstituted after the fact to indicate the negative side of ethics \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n morality these people were.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) This looks just an opinion with no=\r\n substantiation and hence I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; leave this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Shri Raman&#39;s rea=\r\nsoning is valid but not sufficient (if that is \n&gt; all he\n&gt; &gt; stated and not=\r\n any more)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) Very true. By extendsion and generalization, if vyAs=\r\na was a con\n&gt; &gt; artist, what does he have to benefit from painting a charac=\r\nter as \n&gt; God?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6) I don&#39;t think there is any dispute about whether=\r\n Rama or \n&gt; Krishna were\n&gt; &gt; born. True that there are disputes on their er=\r\na, divinity etc. but \n&gt; I did\n&gt; &gt; not come across any disputes about their =\r\nvery existence many \n&gt; millenia\n&gt; &gt; ago.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To establish any Truth co=\r\nnclusively, it is not possible by relying \n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; others but by genuinely=\r\n embarking on the search ourselves and \n&gt; employing\n&gt; &gt; all our faculties t=\r\nowards that.

His reasoning was that an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n*Imaginery creation* of some poet can never Inspire & attract\n&gt; &gt; &gt; million=\r\ns of people for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has wri=\r\ntten imaginery story of Mahabhaarat \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic genious =\r\nthen how come he himself features in \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; story? if let&#39;s consider =\r\neven that as a possibility but then WHY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll write another book just=\r\n on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. \n&gt; why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his ow=\r\nn &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then h=\r\now come so many Saints \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can=\r\n argue that becuase of their intense worship of that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perticular Form,=\r\n they could see the same form of the supreme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality...the supreme po=\r\nwer can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is t=\r\nhat, Paramhamsa Yogananda and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never wer=\r\ne a Devotee of that form \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their c=\r\nase, without devotion & \n&gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they got to see the form of Shri Kr=\r\nushna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts about this?

Thanks but can you give me reference about that and who &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; changed the names? - this will be very good point which has bothere=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding, prooving the Mahaabhaarat events=\r\n with astronomical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; combination, can hardly be taken as proof becau=\r\nse while writing his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; creation, Maharshi Vyaasa would have taken co=\r\nmbination of those &lt;BR&gt;&gt; times. - this is just another argument by Logic=\r\nal view.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Vivekananda, in his work &#39;Shri Krishna &amp=\r\n; Bhagvad Gita&#39; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mentions That whether Shri Kishna was a reality or=\r\n Not,\n gita&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; message is great. it gives eternal knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve made argument with some people in the past that &quot;if modern =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; History has not recorded the world events does not mean that the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; existance of human beings was not there on the earth. in other word=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; modern history can never be the only &#39;Pramaan&#39; for judging reali=\r\nty &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of ancient events and personalities. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally =\r\nit seems, that it might remain, matter of our heart and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beliefs.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- I=\r\nn &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@... &gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Utpal ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Ramayana and Mahabharata are collectively referred as itihAsa in &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tradition.

He had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; nobler tasks=\r\n to concentrate his energies on. So we need not rely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on his&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; judgement/opinions on these matters&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Th=\r\ne original names were &#39;suyOdhan, sushAsan&#39; etc. The &#39;du&#39; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; prefix wa=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; substituted after the fact to indicate the negative side of =\r\nethics &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; morality these people were.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) This looks just an opinion with no substantiation and hence=\r\n I&#39;ll&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; leave this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 4) Shri Raman&#39;s r=\r\neasoning is valid but not sufficient (if that is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; stated and not any more)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 5) Very true. By ext=\r\nendsion and generalization, if vyAsa was a con&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; artist, what do=\r\nes he have to benefit from painting a character as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 6) I don&#39;t think there is any dispute about whether Rama =\r\nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Krishna were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; born. True that there are disputes on=\r\n their era, divinity etc. but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I did&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not come across a=\r\nny disputes about their very existence many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; millenia&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nago.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To establish any Truth conclusively, it is =\r\nnot possible by relying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; others but by genuinely em=\r\nbarking on the search ourselves and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; employing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; all our=\r\n faculties towards that. Otherwise, it just remains our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; prejud=\r\niced choice of which scholar&#39;s opinion to value over other.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Prasad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt=\r\n;vedic_pathak@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n Narasimha Garu &amp; Members,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There i=\r\ns a long pending question with me and that is Historical&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nreality or otherwise of our many revered personalities/ events.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Take for instance, &#39;Mahabhaarat&#39; &amp; &#39;Shri Krish=\r\nna&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I would try to give some view poin=\r\nts gathered from all these &lt;BR&gt;&gt; years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from various so=\r\nurces and my own thinking as well-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) M=\r\nahatma Gandhi didn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a reality.he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; thought that it was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n unable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc.=\r\n..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) How can parents name their childr=\r\nen &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as &#39;DURYodhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.. i am not su=\r\nre about the meaning of the names but it implies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n somethi=\r\nng perverted. knwoledgable person in sanskrit can shed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; some&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; light on this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Mahabhaar=\r\nat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; author,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Maharshi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creation and &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; krsihna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was just a &#39;imaginary&#39; central character of hi=\r\ns grand work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; !.....!..... !&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Dr. Raman, in Notable Horoscopes has strongly =\r\nwritten that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna was a historically rea=\r\nlity. His reasoning was that an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of s=\r\nome poet can never Inspire &amp; attract&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of peop=\r\nle for thousans of years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If Maharsh=\r\ni Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; satisfy his poetic genious then how come he himself\n features in &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; story? if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibil=\r\nity but then WHY&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll write another book just on Shri Kr=\r\nishna i.e. Bhaagavata. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; why&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship=\r\n his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) If Shri=\r\n Krishna was never born, then how come so many Saints &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One can argue that be=\r\ncuase of their intense worship of that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; perticular Form, t=\r\nhey could see the same form of the supreme&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reality...the =\r\nsupreme power can take any form for the Bhakta.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The solid=\r\n counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahar=\r\nshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devotee of that form &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, without devotion &=\r\namp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they got to\n see the form of Shri Kr=\r\nushna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts about this?
