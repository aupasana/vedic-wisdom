The appearance was not &quot;before me&quot;. It was=\r\n before my guru Dr Manish Pandit. The only other person present on the temp=\r\nle premises at that time was the gentleman I mentioned, who lost his job af=\r\nter starting Kaali mantra and went to India for pilgrimage. I was not there=\r\n then. Though I was chanting with Manish on other days, I was sent away on =\r\nthat specific day to visit Kanchi and Tirunavannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s p=\r\nlace).\n \nI understand it was Mahaakaali who gave a darshan and asked Manish=\r\n to spread homam as a spiritual sadhana in the world. She told him that she=\r\n would arrange all the resources needed and asked him to just start. She al=\r\nso apparently told him of a sequence of events that were to happen.\n \nInter=\r\nestingly, the head priest of that temple had some books on homam gifted to =\r\nManish and me on the very next day. Neither Manish nor I asked him for such=\r\n books. We never expressed interest in doing homam or learning homam. He hi=\r\nmself got the inspiration. There was a book on different styles of homam fo=\r\nr Ganesha and another book (by Ramakrishna Mutt, Chennai!) on the procedure=\r\ns for various types of homam. Manish and I were gifted one copy each. I per=\r\nused those books to devise the short method described in the manuals.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nInterestingly, how we met that priest and how this shata=\r\n Chandi homam was arranged is based on interesting coincidences. The son of=\r\n the guru of a local priest was visiting greater Boston temporarily. He was=\r\n a famous sivacharya (a special group of priests) from Chennai and the head=\r\n priest of Kaalikambal temple in Chennai. We merely went to take his blessi=\r\nngs on a Thursday night. We chatted a little with him and then my wife aske=\r\nd him &quot;what are you doing on this Saturday&quot;. He immediately said with affec=\r\ntion &quot;we are doing on Saturday whatever Mrs Padmaja (my wife&#39;s name) tells =\r\nus to do&quot;. Please note that we met for the first time in this life and did =\r\nnot know each other at all. My wife said &quot;well, we perform a Satya Narayana=\r\n vratam on every Pournima night. You are most welcome to attend.&quot; He said &quot;=\r\nwe are coming&quot;. Then he called up a few guys in Canada and told them to can=\r\ncel some events in Canada. We learnt later that he was supposed to spend th=\r\nat weekend in Canada. Instead, he decided to stay back and come to our hous=\r\ne.\n \nHe came to our house on Saturday evening (Pournima) with two other sen=\r\nior priests. They stayed till the end of Satya Narayana vratam (almost midn=\r\night) and enjoyed it. As soon as he entered our house, he declared &quot;I must =\r\ndo a Chandi homam at your house. The mother wants me to do a homam here. Bu=\r\nt I have one condition. I and other priests who come with me will not take =\r\neven a cent. You buy the materials needed, but give no money.&quot; Even though =\r\nwe were not excited about the condition, we said ok.\n \nDuring the navaratri=\r\ns of 2005, a few days after a solar eclipse on my lagna (when Sun, Moon, Me=\r\nrcury and Ketu were in Kanya - my lagna and 8th house from Moon), he came w=\r\nith 3 other priests and did a Chandi homam in really grand style. It was an=\r\n amazing experience. It was actually the first time in my life that I heard=\r\n Chandipath. I had never heard it before. Interestingly, I had my own biase=\r\ns. In the morning, I actually prayed to Mahalakshmi (my ishta devata), &quot;O M=\r\nother, these priests want to do Chandi homam at my house and I consented. I=\r\n don&#39;t know who Chandi is. Whichever deity they call, I will be thinking of=\r\n you only. You please come and bless us.&quot; It was partly innocent and partly=\r\n foolish.\n \nThis was my first exposure to Chandipath and the first Chandi h=\r\nomam at my house. To think that I have now done more than 320 Chandi homas =\r\nat my house..\n \n*        *        *\n \nManish was concerned about the contin=\r\nued troubles faced by the Sankaracharya of Kanchi (the state government fil=\r\ned some cases against him) and he decided that we had to perform a Shata Ch=\r\nandi homam for his relief. He was not sure when and where it should happen.=\r\n\n \nAfter the Chandi homam at our house, we became close to that priest and =\r\nkept meeting him regularly (until he left Boston). When I mentioned Manish&#39;=\r\ns wish to him, he said &quot;Sir, we will do the Shata Chandi homam he wanted at=\r\n our temple. I will arrange everything. You and Manish Pandit just come and=\r\n sit for the event. We will take the sankalpa you want. I will do everythin=\r\ng.&quot;\n \nFinally, the shata Chandi homam was conducted March 1-7, 2006. Intere=\r\nstingly, on the 64th day from the poornahuti of that homam, the ruling gove=\r\nrnment of that state was defeated in elections and a new government came.\n =\r\n\nManish put it this way later &quot;Narasimha, who are we to help a great saint =\r\nlike Sankaracharya? We are not capable of helping him. We are really of no =\r\nuse. The idea was not that we would help him. The idea is that we would hel=\r\np *ourselves* because of the positive intention to help Sanakaracharya! It =\r\nis all Her play. See, the Mother gave the thought of helping him and brough=\r\nt us to Chennai. Then she appeared and instructed to spread homam. Now so m=\r\nany people are doing homam and benefiting. In future, many many more will d=\r\no. All this is happening because of a positive intention to help Sanakarach=\r\narya.&quot;\n \nThough the dates for shata Chandi homam were picked almost arbitra=\r\nrily, there was one interesting coincidence. The day on which the ritual wa=\r\ns started (2006 March 1) was actually the lunar birthday (tithi pravesha) o=\r\nf Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. In fact, the time when we took sankalpam formall=\r\ny and kicked off the 7-day-long ritual (in the morning of March 1) was inte=\r\nrestingly within a couple of minutes from the *exact* Tithi Pravesha time (=\r\ntime at which the same fraction of same tithi is left as at birth) of Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa. This was not planned and was a mere coincidence. In fac=\r\nt, I noticed it after the fact!\n \nSome forces beyond the scope of the think=\r\ning of my mind are behind the homam movement that is slowly picking up. I a=\r\nm fortunate to be picked as an instrument in this spiritual movement.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nActually, I do not honestly consider the goddess and Sar=\r\nada Mata (and, for that matter, my guru) to be really different. But that i=\r\ns a different thing.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From=\r\n: Ashwin Rawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, Octob=\r\ner 02, 2008 7:44 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Right deity and sadhana (=\r\nRe: Yogananda)\n\n        Dear Narsimhaji, You mentioned the appearance of mo=\r\nther before you.

If you do not know the \n          righ=\r\nt deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick \n =\r\n         whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.\n\n          Ple=\r\nase remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from \n       =\r\n   sadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worshi=\r\np, \n          sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. Ho=\r\nwever, \n          sometimes it may be necessary to experience the results o=\r\nf some bad karmas \n          before some good things happen. Imagine all yo=\r\nur karmas lying in a pile in a \n          basket. Suppose some of the reall=\r\ny good karmas that will enable you to do \n          serious sadhana and exp=\r\nerience great things lie at the bottom or middle of \n          the pile. Wh=\r\nen you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits \n         =\r\n of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and \n      =\r\n    retrieving those karmas. In the process, some other karmas may spill ov=\r\ner \n          and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So w=\r\nhat? They had \n          to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!\n\n=\r\n          A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly=\r\n \n          undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just ke=\r\nep going.\n\n          One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a =\r\nvery good \n          priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra =\r\nfor a few days, he was \n          laid off and lost his job. He was not per=\r\nturbed. He continued his sadhana \n          and used the break to go on an =\r\nextended trip to India and make a pilgrimage \n          to some nice places=\r\n. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted \n          at the =\r\nKaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got \n      =\r\n    the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the ho=\r\nuse \n          of a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact =\r\nwith my guru \n          very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a =\r\nvision of the Mother on \n          2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She tol=\r\nd him to start the work on spreading \n          homam in the world, this ge=\r\nntleman was present there. Though he could not \n          see the Mother, h=\r\ne actually smelled something out of the world and was \n          baffled. H=\r\ne knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple \n         =\r\n was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people=\r\n \n          on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could =\r\nnot see the \n          Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be present t=\r\nhere at *that* crucial \n          moment. That is enough to mould the rest =\r\nof his life.\n\n          You never know how, when and where the grace of god=\r\n falls on you. \n          Calculations and logic are useless when it comes =\r\nto the grace of god. Just \n          surrender and keep doing whatever sadh=\r\nana you picked. If it needs \n          fine-tuning, somebody will appear to=\r\n tell you that. Any bad things that \n          happen when doing a spiritua=\r\nl sadhana should be viewed as nature settling \n          some debts so that=\r\n you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really \n          auspiciou=\r\ns karmas.\n\n          As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and =\r\nsaburi&quot;. Have devotion \n          and patience.

I=\r\nn the\n          &gt; dream,\n          &gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru =\r\nManish Pandit and I were\n          &gt; sitting in\n          &gt;&gt; front of the f=\r\nire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in\n          &gt; the\n      =\r\n    &gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not\n    =\r\n      &gt; recognize.\n          &gt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen before.\n     =\r\n     &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru after a couple of we=\r\neks. First\n          &gt; he said he\n          &gt;&gt; did not know who the other p=\r\nerson was and said he would&#39;ve\n          &gt; probably known if\n          &gt;&gt; I=\r\n had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it\n          &gt; =\r\nthere.\n          &gt;&gt; However, when we talked in the next weekend, he referre=\r\nd to my\n          &gt; dream and\n          &gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it was. =\r\nHe gave me a name and asked me to\n          &gt; search on\n          &gt;&gt; the in=\r\nternet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n          &gt; my d=\r\nream.\n          &gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda =\r\n(before\n          &gt; him). Though\n          &gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, =\r\nI was not knowledegable about this\n          &gt; lineage and\n          &gt;&gt; did=\r\n not see his picture before. I searched on the internet and\n          &gt; fou=\r\nnd a\n          &gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the per=\r\nson I saw\n          &gt; in my\n          &gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish tran=\r\nsformed into in my dream looked\n          &gt; like a\n          &gt;&gt; slightly yo=\r\nunger version of that photo.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; When I confirmed thi=\r\ns to Manish, he only smiled and\n          &gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n       =\r\n   &gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n      =\r\n    &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about=\r\n the\n          &gt; lineage of\n          &gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage=\r\n of this life starts from\n          &gt; Dattatreya. We\n          &gt;&gt; have a sp=\r\necial attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his\n          &gt; lineage and=\r\n got\n          &gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experienc=\r\ne from\n          &gt; them. We do\n          &gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the=\r\n lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.\n          &gt; But,\n          &gt;&gt; Manish tho=\r\nught there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he\n          &gt; guessed=\r\n\n          &gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he=\r\n\n          &gt; guessed\n          &gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for somethin=\r\ng!\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed su=\r\nbtle connections\n          &gt; between\n          &gt;&gt; several lineages that see=\r\nm disjoint today.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda a=\r\nlso appeared in the prison cell of\n          &gt; Sri\n          &gt;&gt; Aurobindo (=\r\nwho wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)\n          &gt; and\n   =\r\n       &gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n          &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; * * *\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence i=\r\ns that a swamiji from Puri contacted\n          &gt; me within a\n          &gt;&gt; f=\r\new days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa\n          &gt; Yogana=\r\nnda were\n          &gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). H=\r\ne is the\n          &gt; keeper of\n          &gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge tha=\r\nt his guru received from Yukteshwar\n          &gt; Maharaj.\n          &gt;&gt; He vi=\r\nsited me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a\n          &gt; da=\r\ny at my\n          &gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small connection was made with a rep=\r\nresentative\n          &gt; of that\n          &gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. =\r\nAfter all, some karmik debts may\n          &gt; have been\n          &gt;&gt; there..=\r\n.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; * * *\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; I want to make =\r\none thing clear.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this =\r\nmay give the impression that my\n          &gt; guru has\n          &gt;&gt; some psyc=\r\nhic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he\n          &gt; alway=\r\ns\n          &gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever=\r\n. He\n          &gt; says,\n          &gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and l=\r\nower than dirt and capable\n          &gt; of\n          &gt;&gt; nothing. It is all H=\r\ner power. She is the connection between every\n          &gt; entity in\n       =\r\n   &gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument\n     =\r\n     &gt; sometimes\n          &gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no special =\r\nabilities of any\n          &gt; kind.

I also realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him=\r\n to\n          &gt; do things\n          &gt;&gt; that sound impossible or difficult. =\r\nIn fact, I realized that many\n          &gt; great\n          &gt;&gt; saints in the =\r\npast were like this. Several magical things happened\n          &gt; through\n  =\r\n        &gt;&gt; them, but they did not find any pride in them and retained their=\r\n\n          &gt; humility\n          &gt;&gt; and sense of surrender to their chosen f=\r\norm of god and believed\n          &gt; that god\n          &gt;&gt; was the doer of a=\r\nll things and they were mere instruments.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; The day=\r\n you also start believing that, not for the sake of\n          &gt; lecturing o=\r\nr\n          &gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadha=\r\nna\n          &gt; will bear\n          &gt;&gt; fruit.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n          &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n          &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -\n          &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          &gt;&gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          &gt;&gt; Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n          &gt;&gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n          &gt;&gt;\n    =\r\n      &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n          &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot;=\r\n &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n          &gt;=\r\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\n          &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; --- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Imagine \n          him reaching into the pile and &lt;BR&gt;retr=\r\nieving those karmas. In the \n          process, some other karmas may spill=\r\n over &lt;BR&gt;and give their fruits. \n          Some of those may be undesirabl=\r\ne. So what? They had &lt;BR&gt;to be \n          experienced sometime or the other=\r\n, anyway!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A serious sadhaka \n          should never be disheartened =\r\nby a few seemingly &lt;BR&gt;undesirable \n          results after starting a spir=\r\nitual sadhana. Just keep \n          going.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One gentleman I know rece=\r\nived mantra for Kaali from a \n          very good &lt;BR&gt;priest-cum-yogi in la=\r\nte 2005.

He continued his sa=\r\ndhana &lt;BR&gt;and used the break to go on an \n          extended trip to India =\r\nand make a pilgrimage &lt;BR&gt;to some nice places. \n          He participated i=\r\nn the Shata Chandi homam we conducted &lt;BR&gt;at the \n          Kaalikambal tem=\r\nple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got \n          &lt;BR&gt;the opp=\r\nortunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at \n          the ho=\r\nuse &lt;BR&gt;of a priest during the homam. He could observe and \n          inter=\r\nact with my guru &lt;BR&gt;very closely. Most importantly, when my guru \n        =\r\n  had a vision of the Mother on &lt;BR&gt;2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She \n =\r\n         told him to start the work on spreading &lt;BR&gt;homam in the world, th=\r\nis \n          gentleman was present there. Though he could not &lt;BR&gt;see the =\r\nMother, \n          he actually smelled something out of the world and was &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;baffled. He \n          knew something was going on, but did not know wha=\r\nt. The temple &lt;BR&gt;was \n          closed at the time and my guru and this ge=\r\nntlemen were the only people \n          &lt;BR&gt;on the premises when the Mother=\r\n appeared. Even though he could not \n          see the &lt;BR&gt;Mother, it was m=\r\nost fortunate of him to be present there \n          at *that* crucial &lt;BR&gt;m=\r\noment. That is enough to mould the rest of his \n          life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You =\r\nnever know how, when and where the grace of god falls \n          on you. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Calculations and logic are useless when it comes to the \n          grace =\r\nof god. Just &lt;BR&gt;surrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you \n          p=\r\nicked. If it needs &lt;BR&gt;fine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you \n     =\r\n     that. Any bad things that &lt;BR&gt;happen when doing a spiritual sadhana \n =\r\n         should be viewed as nature settling &lt;BR&gt;some debts so that you are=\r\n \n          prepared to receive the fruits of some really &lt;BR&gt;auspicious \n =\r\n         karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha a=\r\nnd \n          saburi&quot;. Have devotion &lt;BR&gt;and patience. There is no limit to=\r\n what you \n          can get then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---=\r\n--------- \n          --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Do a Short \n          Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ \n          homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n      =\r\n    href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank \n      =\r\n    rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/=\r\n group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n          Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. \n          net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish =\r\nsoftware (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath \n          Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.S=\r\nriJagannath.org&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJa=\r\ngan \n          nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- \n          --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Namaste \n          Sir&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what you said makes a lot sense and it wa=\r\ns \n          marvellous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but i have some small doubts&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \n          Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have a guru&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; how \n          can they chooose a particular form of GOD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; bcoz in=\r\n second part \n          of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; is very \n          important, as the analogy he gave of a person&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; who is greedy \n          and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One \n          thing more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; we have so many deities th=\r\nat on diwali i would like \n          to worship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lakshmi and Kali&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we \n          would worship Durga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on =\r\njanmashtami we would fast for \n          KRISHNA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an on MAHASHIVARAT=\r\nRI for SHIVA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like \n          this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with hte change in festiv=\r\nal the deity \n          changes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; though everybody knows GOD =\r\nis ONE but it \n          becomes difficult to get&lt;BR&gt;&gt; out of this&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; mould and if i \n          didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may =\r\nbecome&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          angry&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I Know,this is my foolishne=\r\nss but stiil this \n          thing hangs in the mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One th=\r\ning more&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Suppose if i choose a deity and somethi=\r\nng wrong happens&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          (materiallistically )&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; w=\r\nhat should i consider that my \n          deity was helping me to clear my&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or \n          the NATURE was telling me to=\r\n change the DEITY as I am not fit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          for that DEITY&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and sometimes you feel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; o what \n          am i doing does t=\r\nhis really works&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and one thing \n          more&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; what if we go on doing our pooja and \n          someday&lt;BR&gt;&gt; somethi=\r\nng like what happened to Pt.

I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continue in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; the same vein for a \n          little more time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nI had a dream a couple of \n          years ago early in the morning. In the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n          there was a big ritual fire. My guru=\r\n Manish Pandit and I were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          sitting in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; front o=\r\nf the fire. He was teaching me some \n          pranayama techniques in&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he \n          changed into somebody el=\r\nse that I could not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          recognize.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was not an=\r\nybody I had seen \n          before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I mentioned thi=\r\ns dream to my guru \n          after a couple of weeks. First&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he sai=\r\nd he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not \n          know who the other person was and said =\r\nhe would&#39;ve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; probably \n          known if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had mentione=\r\nd the dream soon after it had \n          happened. I left it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when we talked \n          in the next weekend, he ref=\r\nerred to my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n          said he had an idea wh=\r\no it was. He gave me a name and asked me \n          to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; search on&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the internet for his photo and see if \n          he was the perso=\r\nn I saw in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my dream.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was a guru \n          from the =\r\nlineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him). \n          Though&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not \n          knowledegable a=\r\nbout this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not see \n          his pictur=\r\ne before. I searched on the internet and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; found \n          a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the \n          perso=\r\nn I saw&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish \n          =\r\ntransformed into in my dream looked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n          s=\r\nlightly younger version of that photo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When I \n    =\r\n      confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha=\r\n, \n          there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. =\r\nLeave it \n          for now.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not k=\r\nnow much about \n          kriya yoga or about the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage of&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; Paramahamsa \n          Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts fro=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dattatreya. \n          We&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; have a special attachment t=\r\no Ramakrishna Paramahamsa \n          and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and got&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, \n          inspiration and perhaps experience=\r\n from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. We \n          do&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; not have any direct link t=\r\no the lineage of Paramahamsa \n          Yogananda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Manish thought there were some \n          other indirect links. Moreover, =\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; who I \n          saw, even though I myself h=\r\nad no idea who I saw, and he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; correct=\r\nly. That should count for \n          something!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I w=\r\nill not be surprised if there \n          are indeed subtle connections&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; between&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; several \n          lineages that seem disjoint toda=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, \n          Swami Vivekananda also ap=\r\npeared in the prison cell of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (=\r\nwho wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda \n          and Upanishad)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita \n          knowledge to Sri Aurob=\r\nindo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; An i=\r\nnteresting coincidence is that a swamiji \n          from Puri contacted&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; me within a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; few days after I \n          saw that photo. Hi=\r\ns guru and Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yogananda \n          were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; co-dis=\r\nciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). \n          He is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nkeeper of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge \n          that his guru =\r\nreceived from Yukteshwar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharaj.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; He \n          visited=\r\n me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          =\r\nday at my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small connection was made with \n   =\r\n       a representative&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; lineage soon after the =\r\n\n          dream. After all, some karmik debts may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have been&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; \n          there...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; I want \n          to make one thing clear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Som=\r\ne things I mention \n          like this may give the impression that my&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; guru has&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n          some psychic abilities or siddhis. Tha=\r\nt may indeed be true. But \n          he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; always&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; downplay=\r\ns those things and attaches no \n          importance whatsoever. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n says,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a \n          useless person and lower t=\r\nhan dirt and capable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n          nothing. It is all H=\r\ner power. She is the connection between \n          every&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entity in&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an \n          idiot like me as an=\r\n instrument&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sometimes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and do \n          something using=\r\n me.
