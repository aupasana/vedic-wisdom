Most of us assume that this is only applicable in mundane\nmatter=\r\ns. This is applicable in the path of spirituality too. I know\nthere are peo=\r\nple who think that any affair/process related to God must\nbe done perfectly=\r\n. Honestly ... unless one is an adept, this is\nimpossible and only repeated=\r\n and sincere attempts makes one an adept.\n\nReminds me of the great Kalidasa=\r\n who worshipped Goddess Mahakali for\nnine lives and he was born a dunce in =\r\nhis tenth and she appeared to\nhim in his 10th lifetime, when his sadhana wa=\r\ns complete and he banged\nhis head out of sheer frustration. Imagine!!! In K=\r\naliyuga, along with\nHoma, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best pat=\r\nh for most. \n\nLet me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru wh=\r\nom I also\nconsider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Cha=\r\nndi\nHoma) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!\nWhen=\r\n I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then\noccured =\r\nto me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on\nthe net and I=\r\n found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took\nit up and performe=\r\nd it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then\nreminded me of the book he gi=\r\nfted me, but even in that it was entirely\nin Samskrit and illiterate that I=\r\n am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between\nan instruction and sloka :). Around thi=\r\ns time, Narasimha occasionally\nperformed a longer version of the homam and =\r\nI particpated in it, but\nnever could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to gu=\r\nide me, which he\ndid, but still it did not get through my really dense brai=\r\nns :). I\nfelt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave up=\r\n,\ninstead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really\nintend=\r\ns that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the\nway. In around=\r\n two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided\nto document the Lagh=\r\nu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt\nbelieve my luck and thanked =\r\nthe Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\ngrace. Well ... its been exactly 2yr=\r\ns and I am still at it taking\nbaby-steps and making progress everyday.\n\nI t=\r\nhank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for helping\nme progr=\r\ness.\n\nMy request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We\na=\r\nre humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very\nfirst=\r\n time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.\nIts all a co=\r\nntinuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...\nplenty of time. Th=\r\nese things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen\novernight. No matter wh=\r\nat, complete your homa everyday, that should be\nthe primary goal ... nothin=\r\ng else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you\nget or dont get anything. Slowl=\r\ny we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and\nmove on to higher things. I wish all th=\r\ne best. We should really thank\nour stars that people like Manishji and Nara=\r\nsimhaji are here guiding\nus ... what would be life without them!\n\nThanks fo=\r\nr listening.\nRegards\n-Narayan-\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utp=\r\nal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Garu !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;A servant =\r\ncarrying a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it \n&gt; &gt;is NOT super=\r\nior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank and \n&gt; &gt;cashing it.

Should he abandon th=\r\ne project \n&gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the destination?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutagni =\r\nbeing weak.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignoring those things and not t=\r\nhinking too \n&gt; much about the significance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recom=\r\nmend doing homam without worrying about how well or badly it \n&gt; went and wh=\r\nat results it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Think of your favor=\r\nite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; servant. A servant simply serv=\r\nes the master. Similarly, all the \n&gt; sadhana you do and your other activiti=\r\nes are your way to serve your \n&gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be ve=\r\nry wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; everyday to cash and also many big c=\r\nhecks everyday to mail others. \n&gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically =\r\ncarry papers to the bank and \n&gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable o=\r\nf doing anything in this \n&gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execut=\r\ne god&#39;s agenda in this \n&gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu=\r\n himself) and \n&gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and the=\r\nn. The \n&gt; supreme god of this world operates through various physical perso=\r\nns \n&gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, p=\r\nurify ourselves and try \n&gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just=\r\n as a servant carries \n&gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for g=\r\nod.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promot=\r\ne ego \n&gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million doll=\r\nar \n&gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; carr=\r\nying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; doing thei=\r\nr master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; *instruments* use=\r\nd by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, \n&gt; one who does what ar=\r\ne considered great deeds in this world and one \n&gt; who does what are conside=\r\nred meagre deeds in this world are both \n&gt; servants of god helping god exec=\r\nute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; Neither really owns anything. One may co=\r\nnsider oneself superior to \n&gt; the other because his/her deeds are considere=\r\nd superior by the world, \n&gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who =\r\nconsiders \n&gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something=\r\n less \n&gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god full=\r\ny penetrates one&#39;s \n&gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matt=\r\ner what \n&gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happ=\r\ny and \n&gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in ligh=\r\nt \n&gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana lik=\r\ne homam. It is a job \n&gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But=\r\n you own nothing. \n&gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent=\r\n: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Rega=\r\nrding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reading your r=\r\nesponse another question came into my mind. \n&gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is not=\r\n good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or \n&gt; the fact tha=\r\nt the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I mean actyually i feel when s=\r\nomeone starts doing homa \n&gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa=\r\n agni gets \n&gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me cou=\r\nple of \n&gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one mem=\r\nber \n&gt; in this list had suggested to me, i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; con=\r\ntinuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n-- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;its=\r\nverysimple@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; N=\r\namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a hous=\r\ne(3-\n&gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, wit=\r\nh sand base be \n&gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, you can=\r\n do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \n&gt; actually better than doing =\r\nit in closed space. But realize that a \n&gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an =\r\numbrella around to protect the fire \n&gt; if it rains while you are doing homa=\r\nm. It is not good if fire is \n&gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a hom=\r\nam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; a=\r\nt the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing=\r\n the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras=\r\n mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while list=\r\nening attentively (not \n&gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras wi=\r\nth all the attention \n&gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSuppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; some mundane matte=\r\nr in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n&gt; with focus and thinki=\r\nng of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n&gt; may do nothing for perso=\r\nn X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; mantra. The word mantra means =\r\n&quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n&gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantr=\r\na, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; control over the mind and keeping the min=\r\nd focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between me=\r\nditation and \n&gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditati=\r\non and it \n&gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So makin=\r\ng some \n&gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to sile=\r\nnt \n&gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can ba=\r\nchelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nshould be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody=\r\n whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; has been performed can do it.=\r\n Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas an=\r\nd niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should =\r\nfollow them \n&gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian foo=\r\nd on the \n&gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will =\r\n\n&gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; homam for spir=\r\nitual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and \n&gt; allow them to do=\r\n it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru \n&gt; and perform homam.=\r\n I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the \n&gt; process until the per=\r\nson crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n&gt; through homam and other sp=\r\niritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no=\r\n mantropadesa, it does not matter \n&gt; after a while, when the person crosses=\r\n a threshhold of purity. The \n&gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa b=\r\ny guru is to speed this up \n&gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of p=\r\nurity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n=\r\n&gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n&gt; prog=\r\nress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for \n&gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n&gt; But any =\r\nday is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop hom=\r\nam reminded me of my India \n&gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 20=\r\n08, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; traveled together to several places (on a speci=\r\nfic project). We ended \n&gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (=\r\nwherever we were). \n&gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella=\r\n with me. As \n&gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it=\r\n \n&gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; roo=\r\nftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; told me,=\r\n &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after \n&gt; our homam fi=\r\nnishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our=\r\n homas \n&gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raini=\r\nng \n&gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \n&gt;=\r\n the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small \n&gt; h=\r\noma kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover \n&gt; on th=\r\ne homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and \n&gt; then packed=\r\n everything and went down.

Most of us assume that this is only =\r\napplicable in mundane&lt;BR&gt;matters. This is applicable in the path of spiritu=\r\nality too. I know&lt;BR&gt;there are people who think that any affair/process rel=\r\nated to God must&lt;BR&gt;be done perfectly. Honestly ... unless one is an adept,=\r\n this is&lt;BR&gt;impossible and only repeated and sincere attempts makes one an =\r\nadept.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reminds me of the great Kalidasa who worshipped Goddess Mahak=\r\nali for&lt;BR&gt;nine lives and he was born a dunce in his tenth and she appeared=\r\n to&lt;BR&gt;him in his 10th lifetime, when his sadhana was complete and he bange=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;his head out of sheer frustration. Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path for most. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s\n spiritual Guru whom I also&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Chandi&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nHoma) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!&lt;BR&gt;When =\r\nI got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then&lt;BR&gt;occure=\r\nd to me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on&lt;BR&gt;the net =\r\nand I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took&lt;BR&gt;it up and =\r\nperformed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then&lt;BR&gt;reminded me of the=\r\n book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely&lt;BR&gt;in Samskrit and ill=\r\niterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between&lt;BR&gt;an instruction and slo=\r\nka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally&lt;BR&gt;performed a longer versi=\r\non of the homam and I particpated in it, but&lt;BR&gt;never could grasp it. I the=\r\nn asked Narasimha to guide me, which he&lt;BR&gt;did, but still it did not get th=\r\nrough my really dense brains :). I&lt;BR&gt;felt really helpless, but the stars w=\r\nere such that I never gave\n up,&lt;BR&gt;instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord =\r\nGanesha, that If he really&lt;BR&gt;intends that I perform the homa, then he shou=\r\nld kindly show me the&lt;BR&gt;way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me t=\r\nhat he has decided&lt;BR&gt;to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I=\r\n just couldnt&lt;BR&gt;believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent=\r\n for his&lt;BR&gt;grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taki=\r\nng&lt;BR&gt;baby-steps and making progress everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I thank Manishji, Nar=\r\nasimha and the all the divine forces for helping&lt;BR&gt;me progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My =\r\nrequest, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We&lt;BR&gt;are hum=\r\nans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very&lt;BR&gt;first ti=\r\nme, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.&lt;BR&gt;Its all a co=\r\nntinuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...&lt;BR&gt;plenty of time.=\r\n These things take their own sweet time, doesnt happen&lt;BR&gt;overnight. No mat=\r\nter what, complete\n your homa everyday, that should be&lt;BR&gt;the primary goal =\r\n... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you&lt;BR&gt;get or dont get an=\r\nything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and&lt;BR&gt;move on to higher thing=\r\ns. I wish all the best. We should really thank&lt;BR&gt;our stars that people lik=\r\ne Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding&lt;BR&gt;us ... what would be life wi=\r\nthout them!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;-Narayan-&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---=\r\n In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pa=\r\nthak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Garu !!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;cashing it.

Let me give an analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Think of your favor=\r\nite deity as the master and yourself as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; servant. A servant simpl=\r\ny serves the master. Similarly, all the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana you do and your ot=\r\nher activities are your way to serve your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; master.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in t=\r\nhis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda =\r\nin this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world. That is why various gods (including\n Vishnu himself=\r\n) and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then.=\r\n The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; supreme god of this world operates through various physical p=\r\nersons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; present on earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We do homam an=\r\nd other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to help others=\r\n, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries &lt;BR&gt;&gt; master&#39;s p=\r\napers to the bank, we do such work for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Doin=\r\ng what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote ego &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an=\r\nd we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; car=\r\nrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; doi=\r\nng their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *ins=\r\ntruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; o=\r\nne who does what are considered great deeds in this\n world and one &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nservants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ne=\r\nither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the world, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; himsel=\r\nf/herself superior to another servant carrying something less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; valu=\r\nable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god=\r\n fully penetrates one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is s=\r\nafe no matter what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. On=\r\ne can remain happy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise an=\r\nd criticism and in light &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and darkness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nHave the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; you are doing for god. You do the best you\n can. But you own nothing. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; You are doing it for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comca=\r\nst.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. ne=\r\nt&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJ=\r\nagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:v=\r\nedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47=\r\n AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Read=\r\ning your response another question came into my mind. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; You said:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in =\r\nthe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Is it not good t=\r\nhat the fire gets extinguished by rain, or\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the fact that the fire=\r\n is getting extinguished?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I mean actyually i fee=\r\nl when someone starts doing homa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regularly, there can be instances=\r\n when the homa agni gets &lt;BR&gt;&gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..=\r\nhappened with me couple of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; times.... i seriously dont knbow what t=\r\no make of it but as one member &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in this list had suggested to me, i=\r\n relight the fire and keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; continuing with the homa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bh=\r\nairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4=\r\n/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wis=\r\ndom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Phani,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can =\r\nHomam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; floors) ?

Doing it in the open is &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; at th=\r\ne bottom. Use a square shaped huma\n kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; should one =\r\nrepeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while listening attentively (no=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the atte=\r\nntion &lt;BR&gt;&gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; som=\r\ne mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nwith focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n However, there is a difference between meditation an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation an=\r\nd it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So maki=\r\nng some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed =\r\nto silent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; conditions/niyamas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apar=\r\nt from having vegeterain food?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whos=\r\ne upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; has been performed can do it=\r\n. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One should =\r\nfollow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; guru. Whatever rules one=\r\n&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; strictly. At the minimum, one=\r\n should eat only vegetarian food on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; day of homam and take a ba=\r\nth before\n homam. Another rule I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; recommend is to avoid eating=\r\n any solid food 2 hours before homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; By the way=\r\n, if one without a sacred thread wants to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; homam for spiritual p=\r\nrogress, I am willing to take responsibility and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; allow them to do =\r\nit. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and perform h=\r\nomam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; process un=\r\ntil the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity &lt;BR&gt;&gt; through h=\r\nomam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sacred thr=\r\nead, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter &lt;BR&gt;&gt; after a w=\r\nhile, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; goal of =\r\nupanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and =\r\nmake the person cross the threshhold of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nAs long as one desires no specific material benefits (and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ready to=\r\n\n receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; progres=\r\ns, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; me.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any d=\r\nay would be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fine?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi hom=\r\nam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But any day is fine really.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mentioning rain =\r\nand rooftop homam reminded me of my India &lt;BR&gt;&gt; trip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tr=\r\naveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; se=\r\nriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ro=\r\noftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nold me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To my surpr=\r\nise, it did rain as soon as our homas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; finished. After we offered p=\r\noornaahuti, it suddenly started raining &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with really big drops. Luc=\r\nkily, there was a small towel/blanket on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the rooftop close to us. =\r\nTogether, we held it on top of the two small &lt;BR&gt;&gt; homa kundas, closed o=\r\nur eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the homa kundas =\r\nuntil fire in the two homa kundas went off and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then packed everyth=\r\ning and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that day, but we =\r\nwere told that a heavy rain continued for a few days &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in New Delhi.=\r\n In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the north, e=\r\nast and west of India. It rained in every place we went\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to, as we=\r\n finished our task in that place and prepared to move on..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; home..comcast. net=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedica=\r\nst/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n rolog=\r\ner.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; nath..org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga =\r\n&lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam=\r\n daily, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top =\r\nof a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; floors) ?
