The objective is to have neither=\r\n\naversion nor attachment.

This is condemned by Lord Kris=\r\nhna\n&gt; in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It is an instrume=\r\nnt for\n&gt; Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body is not kep=\r\nt strong\n&gt; and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attach=\r\nment to\n&gt; sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana of Sadh=\r\nus and\n&gt; Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana of w=\r\norldly\n&gt; persons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult=\r\n to get rid of the\n&gt; Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. =\r\nThe feeling, &quot;I am a\n&gt; great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhimana. The b=\r\nody of a Sannyasi, who\n&gt; has dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is =\r\na public property. He has\n&gt; no claim on it because he denies the existence =\r\nof body and tries to feel\n&gt; always: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public will =\r\ntake care of his body.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe auster=\r\nities, gave up food and yet\n&gt; he was not able to attain the goal. He heard =\r\nthe song:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar&#39;s tuned,\n&gt;\n&gt; Tune us th=\r\ne Sitar neither low nor high.\n&gt;\n&gt; And we will dance away the hearts of men\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; The string o&#39;erstretched breaks and the music flies,\n&gt;\n&gt; The string o&#39;e=\r\nrslack is dumb and music dies,\n&gt;\n&gt; Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Then he ate food, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achieving\n&gt;=\r\n Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all necessary for attaining\n&gt; perfec=\r\ntion. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya born of strong\n&gt; discriminat=\r\nion. All bodies are not fit for the practice of severe\n&gt; austerities. The b=\r\nody will drop down if you tax it too much by way of rigid\n&gt; Tapas. Do not s=\r\npoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a\n&gt; strong, healthy bo=\r\ndy, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to\n&gt; give it up at any=\r\n time for a noble cause.\n&gt;\n&gt; The care-taker of the horse feeds it with prop=\r\ner nutrition when it is\n&gt; over-worked, when it is ailing. Then only it is r=\r\neady for further work. Even\n&gt; so, this body should be injected with proper =\r\nnutrition. Then only it will\n&gt; turn out good work. Then only it will soon r=\r\negain its lost vitality on\n&gt; account of overwork or ailment. Work will suff=\r\ner if the body is not well\n&gt; attended to. When the body grows old it must b=\r\ne well-protected against cold\n&gt; and well-looked after. If hard Titiksha is =\r\npractised now, it will give way\n&gt; soon. Consequently, the other shore of im=\r\nmortality and fearlessness cannot\n&gt; be reached.\n&gt;\n&gt; O Ram, neglect not this=\r\n body. The society and Prakriti will extract and\n&gt; continue to extract as m=\r\nuch work as possible from those selfless workers who\n&gt; have dedicated their=\r\n lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to\n&gt; service till the las=\r\nt breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs\n&gt; Prahlada, &quot;My dear Pr=\r\nahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body.\n&gt; Rise from your Sama=\r\ndhi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot;\n&gt; Yoga Vasishtha s=\r\npeaks of one as a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has\n&gt; renounced the id=\r\nea of &quot;I am a Tyagi&quot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither\n&gt; accepts nor reject=\r\ns things that come by themselves by identifying himself\n&gt; with the silent w=\r\nitness, the Immortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am Akarta\n&gt; (non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I =\r\nam Abhokta (non-enjoyer) &quot; even while moving amidst objects.\n&gt; The Gita say=\r\ns, &quot;But the disciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with\n&gt; senses fre=\r\ne from attraction and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to\n&gt; Peace.&quot; Ch=\r\napter II-64.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha=\r\n Tyagins&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;Maha Bhogins&quot; and quote scriptures also: &quot;We eat without to=\r\nngues; we see\n&gt; without eyes&quot;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out=\r\n soon. They are\n&gt; just like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to =\r\nsatisfy their\n&gt; palates and quote Gita:=97&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Naina=\r\nm Dahati Pavakah;\n&gt; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=97&quot;Weap=\r\nons cleave him not, nor\n&gt; fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind dr=\r\nieth him away&quot;. Sublime\n&gt; philosophy indeed of perverted people with perver=\r\nted intellects! The gilted\n&gt; ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The cr=\r\now that shines under borrowed\n&gt; feathers of the peacock will be found out s=\r\noon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas\n&gt; will burst out and any lay bystander can =\r\ndetect the hypocrite without\n&gt; difficulty.\n&gt;\n&gt; A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi w=\r\nill not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup\n&gt; of milk when they come by =\r\nthemselves. But he will not crave for them. He\n&gt; will not say, &quot;I have enjo=\r\nyed today good mangoes or good milk.&quot; If an\n&gt; aspirant is seriously ailing,=\r\n if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if\n&gt; there is a feeling of wan=\r\nt in him for milk, if he has no money with him to\n&gt; purchase milk, if any d=\r\nevotee casually offers of his own accord some milk,\n&gt; he should not refuse =\r\nit. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his\n&gt; devotees by working thro=\r\nugh the minds of various persons.\n&gt;\n&gt; The child sometimes eats food at nigh=\r\nt while he is sleeping. If the mother\n&gt; asks the child in the morning. &quot;Bab=\r\ny, you took food last night,&quot; he replies,\n&gt; &quot;I have not taken anything last=\r\n night. You are playing and joking with me.&quot;\n&gt; Such is the condition of a J=\r\neevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He\n&gt; eats and yet he does not ea=\r\nt. He eats without a mouth and smells without a\n&gt; nose. Sometimes a man tal=\r\nks at night when he dreams. If you ask him when he\n&gt; comes to waking consci=\r\nousness, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last\n&gt; night when you were d=\r\nreaming?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember anything.&quot; Such\n&gt; is the state of a=\r\n Jeevanmukta or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.\n&gt;\n&gt; Durvasa ate a sumptuous me=\r\nal and yet he said, &quot;I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do\n&gt; not eat anything. I take =\r\ngrass juice only&quot;, because he identified himself\n&gt; with the Atma who is alw=\r\nays the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is\n&gt; regarded as a Nitya =\r\nBrahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini and\n&gt; Satyabhama. Sage Tiruva=\r\nlluvar said to his wife, &quot;My beloved! Say unto the\n&gt; river that my husband,=\r\n a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give path\n&gt; of way. She will at =\r\nonce yield and you can cross it without a boat.&quot; She\n&gt; repeated the words o=\r\nf her husband and crossed the river immediately. She was\n&gt; quite amazed at =\r\nthe words of her husband and asked him, &quot;My Lord! You are\n&gt; living with me =\r\nand yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am struck\n&gt; with wonder=\r\n. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluvar\n&gt; replied, &quot;I=\r\n am immortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognition\n&gt; (Anubhav=\r\na). I do not do anything. I am the silent witness. The senses,\n&gt; body, mind=\r\n and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct from\n&gt; them.&quot; Tir=\r\nuvalluvai&#39; s wife understood the nature of the soul and then she\n&gt; became s=\r\nilent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ordinary aspirants with delicate health should not take recourse=\r\n to the\n&gt; practice of drastic austerities. He who has attained Kaya Siddhi =\r\ncan do any\n&gt; kind of Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an aspirant w=\r\nith delicate\n&gt; health gives up food and tries to live on neem leaves alone,=\r\n the obvious\n&gt; result is that he will get various sorts of gastro-intestina=\r\nl diseases and\n&gt; pass away soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who =\r\npractise Tamasic\n&gt; Tapas.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have mastery over the pair of opposite=\r\ns, viz., heat and cold, if you\n&gt; can bear intense heat and intense cold, if=\r\n you can remain without clothing\n&gt; in the icy Gangotri, this is highly cred=\r\nitable indeed. But if your frame is\n&gt; delicate, if you attempt to stand bef=\r\nore the sun in summer for some hours,\n&gt; if you throw off your clothing in t=\r\nhe Gangotri all at once, you will die\n&gt; immediately of sunstroke or pneumon=\r\nia. You should not attempt to take\n&gt; recourse to these hard practices. What=\r\n little you will gain by Japa and\n&gt; meditation in this birth will be lost, =\r\nand you have lost one chance given by\n&gt; the Lord in this birth to reach him=\r\n by your foolish practices or Tamasic\n&gt; Tapas.\n&gt;\n&gt; An aspirant gave up his =\r\nclothing all at once. He developed rheumatism,\n&gt; malaria, enlarged spleen a=\r\nnd died within a short time. During the period of\n&gt; sickness all cravings t=\r\nhat were temporarily suppressed asserted themselves\n&gt; with re-doubled force=\r\n. He became a slave of the tongue. He craved for many\n&gt; varieties of food. =\r\nHe could not suppress them. He ate indiscriminately and\n&gt; died of acute dia=\r\nrrhoea.\n&gt;\n&gt; An aspirant said, &quot;I have not realised the Self though I did me=\r\nditation for\n&gt; some years. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, &quot;I =\r\nam immortal\n&gt; Atma&quot;. I have got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, bec=\r\nause my motive\n&gt; is pure. I will attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually com=\r\nmitted the\n&gt; abominable act. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the s=\r\ncriptures?\n&gt; Certainly not. This is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who=\r\n have no idea\n&gt; of the nature of true Vairagya, who have not lived under th=\r\ne guidance of\n&gt; their masters for some time, commit such ignoble acts. They=\r\n can never get\n&gt; salvation by taking to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (mot=\r\nive) may be pure.\n&gt; They cannot entertain the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the=\r\n time of committing\n&gt; the act. Horrible thoughts will crowd at the critical=\r\n juncture. They will\n&gt; have to share obviously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The mind should gradually be weaned off its old habits and cravings. I=\r\nf you\n&gt; cut off all at once its pleasure centres, it will get puzzled. That=\r\n is the\n&gt; reason why young aspirants who take to too much Vairagya commit t=\r\nhe ignoble\n&gt; act of committing suicide. You should train the mind in medita=\r\ntion gradually\n&gt; and make it taste the inner bliss. Gradually it will leave=\r\n off its old\n&gt; habits and old cravings and you can get yourself established=\r\n in true\n&gt; Vairagya.\n&gt;\n&gt; The more the Viveka, the more the true Vairagya. T=\r\nhe flower of Vairagya\n&gt; gradually grows in the garden of Antahkarana from t=\r\nhe understanding that the\n&gt; world is a mere appearance and full of miseries=\r\n and that Brahman alone is\n&gt; the only reality full of knowledge and bliss, =\r\nand through continued practice\n&gt; of meditation and association with the rea=\r\nlised souls for a protracted\n&gt; period. Eventually, all objects of the world=\r\n appear before the dispassionate\n&gt; soul as trifling or worthless things. He=\r\n will not give up his new spiritual\n&gt; life even if the wealth of the whole =\r\nworld is offered to him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Aspirants should give up those articles of foo=\r\nd which they like best for\n&gt; some time. They should discipline all the Indr=\r\niyas in a perfect manner. They\n&gt; should always lead a simple life. They sho=\r\nuld always eat simple food. But\n&gt; they should not become slaves of Vairagya=\r\n. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental\n&gt; state. The Lord infuses this in his devote=\r\nes in order to get rid of the\n&gt; clinging to sensual objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; May you al=\r\nl become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from\n&gt; the canke=\r\nr of Vairagya Abhimana!\n&gt;\n&gt; May you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya!=\r\n!\n&gt;\n&gt; May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !\n&gt;\n&gt; Real Vairagya\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhere was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear\n&gt; he=\r\nat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for some hours. In\n&gt; win=\r\nter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He used to sleep on a\n&gt; =\r\nbed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.\n&gt;\n&gt; On one occasion one of his admire=\r\nrs, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri\n&gt; Ram provided him a cot to sleep. =\r\nThe Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot.\n&gt; He asked him to provide a bed o=\r\nf grass. There was much rain on that day. It\n&gt; was extremely difficult for =\r\nhim to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get\n&gt; for the Swami a bed of g=\r\nrass with great difficulty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Ram said: &quot;Swamiji, it is very difficul=\r\nt to get grass here. It is\n&gt; raining now in torrents. Kindly use the cot to=\r\nday. This will not bind you in\n&gt; any way. You are an advanced Sannyasi. Wha=\r\nt is it for you whether the body\n&gt; lies on a bed of grass or on a cot?&quot; The=\r\n Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I must\n&gt; have my usual bed of grass only. You=\r\n must bring it anyhow.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as at=\r\ntachment itself. Vairagya is\n&gt; a means for attaining wisdom of the Self. It=\r\n is not the goal itself. A\n&gt; Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neither Raga =\r\nnor Vairagya. If you give him\n&gt; a little dry bread alone, he is quite satis=\r\nfied. He will not grumble. If you\n&gt; give him best sweetmeats, milk and frui=\r\nts, he will not refuse, but he will\n&gt; not be elated by good food. He always=\r\n takes delight in his own Self only,\n&gt; but not in external objects. This is=\r\n the test to find out whether a man has\n&gt; attained realisation or not. A wo=\r\nrldly man is much troubled when he cannot\n&gt; get the right kind of food whic=\r\nh he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains\n&gt; palatable dishes. A realised=\r\n soul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes\n&gt; and dislikes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suka De=\r\nva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate\n&gt; for so=\r\nme days. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees\n&gt; se=\r\nrved him and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Obviously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not\n&gt; att=\r\nained equanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to\n&gt; Vairagy=\r\na even after several years of spiritual practice. He was not\n&gt; completely f=\r\nree from all sorts of attachments because he was attached to\n&gt; Vairagya. He=\r\n did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage\n&gt; is quite=\r\n indifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep\n&gt; on the=\r\n bed of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the\n&gt; same f=\r\neeling.\n&gt;\n&gt; He who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is ca=\r\nlled a Maha\n&gt; Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise=\r\n Vairagya, but\n&gt; it is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Some Sannyasins who are working for the public good make resolves: &quot;We wi=\r\nll\n&gt; not travel in trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits=\r\n, etc.\n&gt; We will not use fountain pens or watch.&quot; These are not desirable r=\r\nesolves.\n&gt; This is not the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached =\r\nto Vairagya.\n&gt; This is another kind of defect. They want to do service. If =\r\nthey move in\n&gt; cars or trains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, th=\r\ney can do more\n&gt; service in a short space of time. Those who do much writin=\r\ng-work can turn\n&gt; out much work if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness ass=\r\numes various forms.\n&gt; This is one kind. It does not leave even educated per=\r\nsons or cultured\n&gt; Sannyasins.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in ord=\r\ner to gat Pratishta or fame and\n&gt; respect. But God knows the motives of all=\r\n, as He is the Antaryami or inner\n&gt; Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wher=\r\ne is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where there\n&gt; is=\r\n no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not\n&gt; renoun=\r\nced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed\n&gt; th=\r\ne objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the\n&gt; o=\r\nbjects of the world even though he shows externally that he is a great\n&gt; Vi=\r\nrakta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small\n&gt; w=\r\nooden bowl only in his hand?\n&gt;\n&gt; Raja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. P=\r\neople reported that the city of\n&gt; Mithila was burst and yet, he was not a b=\r\nit affected. That is real Vairagya.\n&gt; He alone can be called a real great V=\r\nirakta.\n&gt;\n&gt; Young aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They shoul=\r\nd not take\n&gt; advantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. Thi=\r\ns can be\n&gt; practised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over=\r\n all beings.\n&gt; Beginners should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, B=\r\nrahmacharya and\n&gt; Vairagya to the very letter and spirit.\n&gt;\n&gt; May you all t=\r\nranscend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self.\n&gt; May you all =\r\nunderstand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vairagya is the re=\r\nin by which the uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe\n&gt; Vairagya is inten=\r\nse attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for\n&gt; anything other tha=\r\nn Atma.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one considers the position and happiness of Brahma even as t=\r\nhe dung of a\n&gt; cow, then only he has developed a real lasting Vairagya. Tem=\r\nporary fleeting\n&gt; dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help the aspirant=\r\n in the attainment\n&gt; of Self-realisation.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is common to have dispassi=\r\non for some particular objects by some cause\n&gt; or other. But by having disp=\r\nassion for all objects at all times, one will\n&gt; get knowledge of the Self. =\r\nYou may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the\n&gt; Guru, by devotion to him,=\r\n and by practice of what he instructs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do not fall a victim of Moha eve=\r\nn if you happen to move in towns with young\n&gt; and well-adored fashionable l=\r\nadies of high civilised societies. Resolve to\n&gt; attain Self-realisation. Th=\r\ne Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.\n&gt;\n&gt; Devotion, dispassion and know=\r\nledge of Atma are the three means of\n&gt; salvation. Dispassion is desirelessn=\r\ness This All-full Atma resides in the\n&gt; chambers of the heart and so everyb=\r\nody has this Atma.\n&gt;\n&gt; Light on Vairagya\n&gt;\n&gt; Vairagya is born of Viveka, di=\r\nscrimination between Nitya and Anitya\n&gt; (eternal and non-eternal) , Sat and=\r\n Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and\n&gt; Atattwa. Viveka comes through disinte=\r\nrested selfless service done in several\n&gt; births and through Puja and Aradh=\r\nana, and through the Grace of the Lord.\n&gt; From Viveka is born Vairagya. It =\r\ngives spiritual strength.\n&gt;\n&gt; A man of Vairagya has no attraction for the w=\r\norld. It is like a straw. So\n&gt; Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth =\r\nfor aspirants. Vairagya produces\n&gt; concentration of mind, Samadhana, and ge=\r\nnerates burning Mumukshutwa, strong\n&gt; yearning for Liberation or Emancipati=\r\non, or Release.\n&gt;\n&gt; Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a litt=\r\nle pleasure, there\n&gt; is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Lik=\r\ne and dislike are one.\n&gt; Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictio=\r\nns, according to Patanjali\n&gt; Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ig=\r\nnorance), Asmita (egoism),\n&gt; Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha =\r\n(clinging to life). First,\n&gt; there is ignorance, the original Avidya. From =\r\nthis is born egoism, Asmita,\n&gt; and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and fro=\r\nm Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the\n&gt; clinging to this life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vairagya is of=\r\n different types or degrees=97Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild,\n&gt; moderate =\r\nand intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to stick\n&gt; to th=\r\nis path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava\n&gt; Vairagy=\r\na, the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that were\n&gt; reno=\r\nunced previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not be\n&gt; ab=\r\nle to climb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants should\n&gt;=\r\n be careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try to=\r\n\n&gt; make it moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into t=\r\nhe\n&gt; defects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is=\r\n\n&gt; illusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and ag=\r\nain\n&gt; by looking into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It shoul=\r\nd be\n&gt; strengthened through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and=\r\n\n&gt; enquiry.\n&gt;\n&gt; Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinkin=\r\ng cow&#39;s urine\n&gt; does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born =\r\nof\n&gt; discrimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from=\r\n\n&gt; sensual enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=97Thanumanasi=97 and =\r\nthen\n&gt; only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make =\r\nenquiry.\n&gt; Physical nudity and these external things will not constitute re=\r\nal Vairagya.\n&gt; Real Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these o=\r\nbjects do not\n&gt; give us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorro=\r\nw. Such deep\n&gt; enquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time,=\r\n produces\n&gt; lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It hel=\r\nps him to do\n&gt; real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya p=\r\nuts a break to\n&gt; the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs =\r\ntowards objects,\n&gt; at once it will point out that there is pain there, that=\r\n sensual enjoyment\n&gt; is the cause\n&gt; for rebirth and intense suffering. So t=\r\nhe mind is terribly afraid, and\n&gt; gradually through intense practice, it is=\r\n established in real, lasting,\n&gt; sustained, intense Vairagya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vairagya =\r\nis of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para\n&gt; Vairagya com=\r\nes after one attains Self-realisation. The whole world then\n&gt; looks like a =\r\nstraw. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Para\n&gt; Vairagya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wit=\r\nhout Vairagya there cannot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it\n&gt; =\r\nis the only vital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other\n&gt; v=\r\nirtues will come by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhyaasa\n&gt; vairaag=\r\nyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=97&quot;The mind is controlled by meditation or\n&gt; Sadhan=\r\na and Vairagya.&quot; They are the two wings of the aspirant to soar high\n&gt; into=\r\n the realm of Immortal Abode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says.\n&gt; &quot;Abh=\r\nyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihyate&quot;=97&quot;The mind is controlled by\n&gt;=\r\n practice and Vairagya, dispassion, intense detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the\n&gt;=\r\n mind is detached. He who works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So=\r\n\n&gt; it is aspirants&#39; duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka,\n&gt; V=\r\nairagya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vairagya is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not=\r\n run into\n&gt; sensual grooves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chud=\r\nalai ruled a\n&gt; kingdom, and yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst=\r\n the temptations\n&gt; of the world, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and=\r\n wisdom. So she was\n&gt; not affected in the least by the attractive objects o=\r\nf the world, even\n&gt; though she ruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhid=\r\nhwaja, went to the\n&gt; forest renouncing his kingdom, yet he was not establis=\r\nhed in Vairagya. He\n&gt; was attached to the body, he was attached to his Kama=\r\nndalu. A man may be\n&gt; attached to any one object.\n&gt;\n&gt; You see a Vairagi. Hi=\r\ns whole body is smeared with ash, but he will fight\n&gt; for a rupee if he fin=\r\nds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. This is his\n&gt; mental state. So by=\r\n external appearance you cannot tell that one has\n&gt; Vairagya. Vairagya is a=\r\n mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not belong to this\n&gt; extreme type of Vaira=\r\ngya=97wearing only a rope around the waist. He was amidst\n&gt; luxurious thing=\r\ns, but his mind was not polluted. He had that mental state of\n&gt; Vairagya, d=\r\netachment, indifference, born of Viveka.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Krishna says that He is n=\r\not in favour of extreme asceticism.\n&gt; &quot;Karshayantah sareerastham bhootagram=\r\namachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast\n&gt; ham tan vidhyasuranischayan .&quot;=97&quot;T=\r\nhey torture all the elements in the body\n&gt; and Me also who dwells in the bo=\r\ndy.&quot; Lord Buddha also tortured his body, and\n&gt; later on he found out that t=\r\nhere was not much spiritual progress; and then\n&gt; he came to the golden medi=\r\num, the middle path. So we should go by the middle\n&gt; path always. The body =\r\nis an instrument for attaining Self-realisation.\n&gt; Especially in this Kali =\r\nYuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should not\n&gt; torture the body. Whate=\r\nver is needed for the body you should have. You\n&gt; should not expose the bod=\r\ny to chill. God has given common sense. So you\n&gt; should practise &quot;common se=\r\nnse Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm in taking good,\n&gt; healthy food. Every man ha=\r\ns got a different physical constitution. You\n&gt; should use common sense in y=\r\nour Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot\n&gt; sit for a long\n&gt; time in o=\r\nne Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some fruits. You\n&gt; should h=\r\nave extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya internally and at the same time\n&gt; follow t=\r\nhe middle path externally.\n&gt;\n&gt; Generally, aspirants say: &quot;I have given up u=\r\nmbrella.&quot;=85 &quot;I take only one\n&gt; meal.&quot; Their whole Sadhana is: &quot;I have give=\r\nn up shirt.&quot;=85 &quot;I have given up\n&gt; sweater.&quot;=85 &quot;I have given up shoes.&quot;=85=\r\n &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&quot; Their\n&gt; Sadhana consists in &quot;giving up&quot;=\r\n=97give up this, give up that. Real spiritual\n&gt; life does not involve any g=\r\niving up or taking. There is no giving up or\n&gt; taking. The only thing is, y=\r\nou should not give leniency to the mind. If you\n&gt; are very hungry in the mo=\r\nrning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of\n&gt; milk. Vairagya is a me=\r\nntal state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It\n&gt; will hurl you down. =\r\nAlways be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the present moment, there=\r\n is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a\n&gt; great Vairagi. For the last s=\r\no many years he is living without clothing in\n&gt; the icy region and he sleep=\r\ns over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a\n&gt; very good description o=\r\nf him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a\n&gt; wonderful man and made h=\r\nim his Guru.\n&gt;\n&gt; Avadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi. He was living in =\r\nRishikesh. He was\n&gt; very much liked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass.=\r\n Malaviaji once took\n&gt; him to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It=\r\n was raining, and\n&gt; Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to sleep. He was a=\r\n Vairagi. Vairagi is\n&gt; a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cult. They put=\r\n ash all over the body\n&gt; and make the hair look golden, and they wear a ver=\r\ny thick rope, of the size\n&gt; used for drawing chariots. This is Vairagya Sam=\r\npradaya. In Lakshman Jhula\n&gt; there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Tapas. T=\r\nhey have got a physical body.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is another great Vairagi, our Senda=\r\nmangalam Brahmendra Swami. He\n&gt; lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to take fo=\r\nod left in the leaves that are\n&gt; thrown out by others after meals. &quot;Avadhoo=\r\ntas&quot; are naked people. They have\n&gt; no clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is o=\r\nne who has shaved his mind of all\n&gt; Vasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed=\r\n, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra\n&gt; Swami lived a very austere life. He =\r\nwas Poornabodha&#39; s Guru and Swami\n&gt; Krishnananda&#39; s Guru. Once in his Ashra=\r\nm, they prepared very good food, and\n&gt; Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to=\r\n be given to cows. He used to make\n&gt; severe tests. Sankarananda is also his=\r\n disciple. He had a very strong body\n&gt; and lived an austere life.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- ---\n&gt;\n&gt; `Light on Vairagya&#39; will resume next week.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e6d77ee46af79204836a3f24\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHe wasn&#39;t saying to indulge in anything, but to realize that one should=\r\nn&#39;t get hung up in the other direction either. The objective is to have=\r\n neither aversion nor attachment. For most of us, we have to practice not h=\r\naving attachment, because we indulge excessively, but this is a pointer to =\r\nnot go too much the other way, because that creates its own unhealthy attac=\r\nhment/aversion. So even while we practice renunciation we should keep in mi=\r\nnd that this is a practice, and the objective is balance not just avoidance=\r\n of pleasures for the sake of avoidance. Excessive wearing of hair shirts o=\r\nr self-flagellation (literal or figurative) leads to a perverse enlargement=\r\n of the ego and a reverse attachment, so one has to be balanced.

This is condemned by Lord Krishn=\r\na in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It is an instrument f=\r\nor Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body is not kept stro=\r\nng and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment to =\r\nsensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana of Sadhus and San=\r\nnyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana of worldly perso=\r\nns.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult to get r=\r\nid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. The feeling=\r\n, &quot;I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhimana. The body=\r\n of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is a pub=\r\nlic\n property. He has no claim on it because he denies the existence of bod=\r\ny and tries to feel always: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public wil=\r\nl take care of his body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe a=\r\nusterities, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He hea=\r\nrd the song:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar&#39;s tune=\r\nd, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we will danc=\r\ne away the hearts of men &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The string o&#39;erstretched breaks and th=\r\ne music flies,&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The string o&#39;erslack is dumb and music dies, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he ate food=\r\n, adopted the middle path and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme ascet=\r\nicism is not at all necessary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is s=\r\ntrong mental Vairagya born of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit=\r\n for the practice of severe austerities. The body will drop down if you tax=\r\n it too much by way of rigid\n Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in t=\r\nhe name of Tapas. Have a strong, healthy body, but have no attachment for t=\r\nhe body. Be prepared to give it up at any time for a noble cause.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\ne care-taker of the horse feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-wo=\r\nrked, when it is ailing. Then only it is ready for further work. Even so, t=\r\nhis body should be injected with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn o=\r\nut good work. Then only it will soon regain its lost vitality on account of=\r\n overwork or ailment. Work will suffer if the body is not well attended to.=\r\n When the body grows old it must be well-protected against cold and well-lo=\r\noked after. If hard Titiksha is practised now, it will give way soon. Conse=\r\nquently, the other shore of immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;O Ram, neglect not this body. The society and Prakriti will extra=\r\nct and continue to extract as much work as possible from those selfless wor=\r\nkers who have dedicated\n their lives to the service of humanity. They are y=\r\noked to service till the last breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instr=\r\nucts Prahlada, &quot;My dear Prahlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of y=\r\nour body. Rise from your Samadhi. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far =\r\nand wide.&quot; Yoga Vasishtha speaks of one as a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; an=\r\nd &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has renounced the idea of &quot;I am a Tyagi&=\r\nquot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither accepts nor rejects thing=\r\ns that come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent witness, t=\r\nhe Immortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am Akarta (non-doer)&quot;, &quo=\r\nt;I am Abhokta (non-enjoyer) &quot; even while moving amidst objects. The G=\r\nita says, &quot;But the disciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with =\r\nsenses free from attraction and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\nPeace.&quot; Chapter II-64.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose=\r\n themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; or &quot;Maha Bhogins&quot; and qu=\r\note scriptures also: &quot;We eat without\n tongues; we see without eyes&quo=\r\nt;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are just like t=\r\nhe people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their palates and quo=\r\nte Gita:=97&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavakah; Na chain=\r\nam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=97&quot;Weapons cleave him not=\r\n, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away&quot;.=\r\n Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellects! T=\r\nhe gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines unde=\r\nr borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishnas a=\r\nnd Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite wi=\r\nthout difficulty.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to ac=\r\ncept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he wil=\r\nl not crave for them. He will not say, &quot;I have enjoyed today good mang=\r\noes or good milk.&quot; If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not\n a=\r\nble to eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk=\r\n, if he has no money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually off=\r\ners of his own accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteri=\r\nously. He takes care of his devotees by working through the minds of variou=\r\ns persons.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The child sometimes eats food at night while he is slee=\r\nping. If the mother asks the child in the morning. &quot;Baby, you took foo=\r\nd last night,&quot; he replies, &quot;I have not taken anything last night.=\r\n You are playing and joking with me.&quot; Such is the condition of a Jeeva=\r\nnmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. He =\r\neats without a mouth and smells without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at ni=\r\nght when he dreams. If you ask him when he comes to waking consciousness, &=\r\nquot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last night when you were dreaming=\r\n?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember anything.&quot; Such is the stat=\r\ne of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha\n Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Durvasa ate a su=\r\nmptuous meal and yet he said, &quot;I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do not eat anyt=\r\nhing. I take grass juice only&quot;, because he identified himself with the=\r\n Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is regard=\r\ned as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini and Satyabhama.=\r\n Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, &quot;My beloved! Say unto the river t=\r\nhat my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give path of way.=\r\n She will at once yield and you can cross it without a boat.&quot; She repe=\r\nated the words of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She was qu=\r\nite amazed at the words of her husband and asked him, &quot;My Lord! You ar=\r\ne living with me and yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am str=\r\nuck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy.&quot; Tiruva=\r\nlluvar replied, &quot;I am immortal Atma. I have realised this through dire=\r\nct cognition (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the\n silent witness. Th=\r\ne senses,&lt;br&gt;body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely dis=\r\ntinct from them.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s wife understood the nature of th=\r\ne soul and then she became silent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ordinary aspirants with delicate =\r\nhealth should not take recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He =\r\nwho has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is a=\r\ndamantine. If an aspirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to l=\r\nive on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is that he will get various so=\r\nrts of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obt=\r\nained by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If you have mastery o=\r\nver the pair of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense hea=\r\nt and intense cold, if you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri,=\r\n this is highly creditable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you at=\r\ntempt to stand before the sun in summer for some hours, if\n you throw off y=\r\nour clothing in the Gangotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunst=\r\nroke or pneumonia. You should not attempt to take recourse to these hard pr=\r\nactices. What little you will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth wil=\r\nl be lost, and you have lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to =\r\nreach him by your foolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An aspirant =\r\ngave up his clothing all at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarge=\r\nd spleen and died within a short time. During the period of sickness all cr=\r\navings that were temporarily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled=\r\n force. He became a slave of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of fo=\r\nod. He could not suppress them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute d=\r\niarrhoea.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An aspirant said, &quot;I have not realised the Self tho=\r\nugh I did meditation for some years. I am going to commit suicide with the =\r\nBhava, &quot;I am immortal Atma&quot;. I have got full Vairagya. No sin\n wi=\r\nll cling to me, because my motive is pure. I will attain self-realisation. =\r\n&quot; He actually committed the abominable act. Do you find such a stateme=\r\nnt anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. This is extreme foolishness. =\r\nSome aspirants who have no idea of the nature of true Vairagya, who have no=\r\nt lived under the guidance of their masters for some time, commit such igno=\r\nble acts. They can never get salvation by taking to wrong Tapas though thei=\r\nr Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot entertain the Bhava &quot;I am At=\r\nma&quot; just at the time of committing the act. Horrible thoughts will cro=\r\nwd at the critical juncture. They will have to share obviously the fate of =\r\nPretas (ghosts).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The mind should gradually be weaned off its old h=\r\nabits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleasure centres, it wil=\r\nl get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants who take to too much =\r\nVairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. You should train the=\r\n mind\n in meditation gradually and make it taste the inner bliss. Gradually=\r\n it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and you can get yourself=\r\n established in true Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more the Viveka, the more the tru=\r\ne Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in the garden of Antahka=\r\nrana from the understanding that the world is a mere appearance and full of=\r\n miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality full of knowledge and =\r\nbliss, and through continued practice of meditation and association with th=\r\ne realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, all objects of the wo=\r\nrld appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or worthless things. H=\r\ne will not give up his new spiritual life even if the wealth of the whole w=\r\norld is offered to him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Aspirants should give up those articles of=\r\n food which they like best for some time. They should discipline all the In=\r\ndriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simple life. They\n sh=\r\nould always eat simple food. But they should not become slaves of Vairagya.=\r\n Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this in his devotees =\r\nin order to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May you all =\r\nbecome Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from the canker of=\r\n Vairagya Abhimana!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;May you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya=\r\n!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Real Vairagy=\r\na&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titikshu. He could=\r\n bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for some hours. =\r\nIn winter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He used to sleep o=\r\nn a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On one occasion one of h=\r\nis admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided him a cot to =\r\nsleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him to provide a =\r\nbed of grass. There was much rain on that day. It was extremely\n difficult =\r\nfor him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the Swami a bed of=\r\n grass with great difficulty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Ram said: &quot;Swamiji, it is ver=\r\ny difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents. Kindly use th=\r\ne cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an advanced Sannyas=\r\ni. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of grass or on a cot?&=\r\nquot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I must have my usual bed of gra=\r\nss only. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Attachment to Vairagya is=\r\n as much an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wi=\r\nsdom of the Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage=\r\n has neither Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, h=\r\ne is quite satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats,=\r\n milk and fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good foo=\r\nd. He always takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external object=\r\ns.\n This is the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or =\r\nnot. A worldly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of fo=\r\nod which he likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A rea=\r\nlised soul has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Suka Deva was tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate =\r\nfor some days. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranee=\r\ns served him and gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Obviously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had =\r\nnot attained equanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Va=\r\niragya even after several years of spiritual practice. He was not completel=\r\ny free from all sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. H=\r\ne did not attain Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite =\r\nindifferent to all kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the\n b=\r\ned of grass or a beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeli=\r\nng.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He who is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is cal=\r\nled a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Va=\r\niragya, but it is extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Some Sannyasins who are working for the public good make resolves: &quot;=\r\nWe will not travel in trains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fru=\r\nits, etc. We will not use fountain pens or watch.&quot; These are not desir=\r\nable resolves. This is not the real nature of Vairagya. They are also attac=\r\nhed to Vairagya. This is another kind of defect. They want to do service. I=\r\nf they move in cars or trains, if they keep the body strong and healthy, th=\r\ney can do more service in a short space of time. Those who do much writing-=\r\nwork can turn out much work if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes=\r\n various forms. This is one kind. It does not leave even educated persons o=\r\nr\n cultured Sannyasins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order t=\r\no gat Pratishta or fame and respect. But God knows the motives of all, as H=\r\ne is the Antaryami or inner Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where is =\r\nthe strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where there is no tem=\r\nptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not renounced anyth=\r\ning, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed the objects o=\r\nf the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the objects of the=\r\n world even though he shows externally that he is a great Virakta or dispas=\r\nsionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only i=\r\nn his hand?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Raja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People report=\r\ned that the city of Mithila was burst and yet, he was not a bit affected. T=\r\nhat is real Vairagya. He alone can be called a real great Virakta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Y=\r\noung aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They should not take\n a=\r\ndvantage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be pract=\r\nised only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over all beings. Beg=\r\ninners should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Va=\r\niragya to the very letter and spirit.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;May you all transcend Raga a=\r\nnd Vairagya and attain knowledge of the Self. May you all understand the tr=\r\nue nature and Swaroopa of Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is the rein by which th=\r\ne uncontrollable mind is restrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to=\r\n Atmic bliss and strong dispassion for anything other than Atma.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I=\r\nf one considers the position and happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a =\r\ncow, then only he has developed a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting=\r\n dispassion is not Vairagya. It will not help the aspirant in the attainmen=\r\nt of Self-realisation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is common to have dispassion for some pa=\r\nrticular objects by some cause or other. But by having dispassion for\n all =\r\nobjects at all times, one will get knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-=\r\nJnana soon by the grace of the Guru, by devotion to him, and by practice of=\r\n what he instructs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not fall a victim of Moha even if you happen =\r\nto move in towns with young and well-adored fashionable ladies of high civi=\r\nlised societies. Resolve to attain Self-realisation. The Tamoguna will vani=\r\nsh of its own accord.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Devotion, dispassion and knowledge of Atma a=\r\nre the three means of salvation. Dispassion is desirelessness This All-full=\r\n Atma resides in the chambers of the heart and so everybody has this Atma.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Light on Vairagya&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is born of Viveka, discriminatio=\r\nn between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real a=\r\nnd unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka comes through disinterested selfless=\r\n service done in several births and through Puja and Aradhana, and through =\r\nthe Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is born Vairagya. It gives\n spiritual st=\r\nrength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man of Vairagya has no attraction for the world. It is lik=\r\ne a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth for aspirants. Va=\r\niragya produces concentration of mind, Samadhana, and generates burning Mum=\r\nukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberation or Emancipation, or Release.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Raga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a little pleasure, the=\r\nre is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Like and dislike are =\r\none. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictions, according to Pat=\r\nanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoi=\r\nsm), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha (clinging to life). Firs=\r\nt, there is ignorance, the original Avidya. From this is born egoism, Asmit=\r\na, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, =\r\nthe clinging to this life.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is of different types or degre=\r\nes=97Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderate and\n intense). Intense Vair=\r\nagya only will help the aspirant to stick to this path. If it is of a dull =\r\ntype like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya, the mind will simply be wai=\r\nting to get back the objects that were renounced previously, and the aspira=\r\nnt will get a downfall. He will not be able to climb again to the heights h=\r\ne formerly reached. So aspirants should be careful. Even though the Vairagy=\r\na is of a mild type, they should try to make it moderate; and then intense =\r\nVairagya comes through looking into the defects of sensual life. Sensual pl=\r\neasure is not real happiness. It is illusory, transient, impermanent. It is=\r\n mixed with pain. So again and again by looking into the defects of sensual=\r\n life, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthened through study of spiritual=\r\n books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Simply living in nudity and=\r\n eating neem leaves, and drinking cow&#39;s urine does not constitute real =\r\nVairagya. Vairagya should be born of\n discrimination, enquiry and Vichara. =\r\nBy these, the mind is weaned from sensual enjoyments and rendered thin like=\r\n a thread=97Thanumanasi=97 and then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and=\r\n again you will have to make enquiry. Physical nudity and these external th=\r\nings will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enqu=\r\niry, Vichara. All these objects do not give us lasting happiness. They lead=\r\n us into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in =\r\nfor a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for =\r\nan aspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted=\r\n. This Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if=\r\n the mind runs towards objects, at once it will point out that there is pai=\r\nn there, that sensual enjoyment is the cause&lt;br&gt;\n\nfor rebirth and intense s=\r\nuffering. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gradually through intense pra=\r\nctice, it is established in\n real, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para =\r\nVairagya comes after one attains Self-realisation. The whole world then loo=\r\nks like a straw. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Without Vairagya there cannot be any real spiritual progress. In =\r\nVedanta it is the only vital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, al=\r\nl other virtues will come by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhy=\r\naasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=97&quot;The mind is controlled by =\r\nmeditation or Sadhana and Vairagya.&quot; They are the two wings of the asp=\r\nirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal Abode. The same thing Lord Kr=\r\nishna also says. &quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairagyena cha grihyate&quot;=\r\n=97&quot;The mind is controlled by practice and Vairagya, dispassion, inten=\r\nse detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the mind is detached. He who works in a d=\r\netached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspirants&#39; duty to\n cultiva=\r\nte this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vairagya is doubtless=\r\n a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual grooves. It move=\r\ns towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and yet she ha=\r\nd absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the world, she had=\r\n mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not affected in the =\r\nleast by the attractive objects of the world, even though she ruled a kingd=\r\nom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renouncing his kin=\r\ngdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached to the body, =\r\nhe was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any one object.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but he will=\r\n fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. This =\r\nis his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that one has=\r\n Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not\n belong to thi=\r\ns extreme type of Vairagya=97wearing only a rope around the waist. He was a=\r\nmidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had that mental s=\r\ntate of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Lord K=\r\nrishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. &quot;Karshayan=\r\ntah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham tan vi=\r\ndhyasuranischayan .&quot;=97&quot;They torture all the elements in the body=\r\n and Me also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord Buddha also tortured his bo=\r\ndy, and later on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; a=\r\nnd then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by t=\r\nhe middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisa=\r\ntion. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should=\r\n not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You=\r\n should not expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you\n s=\r\nhould practise &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm in taking=\r\n good, healthy food. Every man has got a different physical constitution. Y=\r\nou should use common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cann=\r\not sit for a long&lt;br&gt;\n\ntime in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanapras=\r\nh or some fruits. You should have extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya in=\r\nternally and at the same time follow the middle path externally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gen=\r\nerally, aspirants say: &quot;I have given up umbrella.&quot;=85 &quot;I tak=\r\ne only one meal.&quot; Their whole Sadhana is: &quot;I have given up shirt.=\r\n&quot;=85 &quot;I have given up sweater.&quot;=85 &quot;I have given up sho=\r\nes.&quot;=85 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&quot; Their Sadhana consi=\r\nsts in &quot;giving up&quot;=97give up this, give up that. Real spiritual l=\r\nife does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving up or taki=\r\nng. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind. If you are=\r\n very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of mi=\r\nlk.\n Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It w=\r\nill hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the=\r\n present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a great Vai=\r\nragi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing in the icy r=\r\negion and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a very go=\r\nod description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a wonderful =\r\nman and made him his Guru.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Avadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi=\r\n. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji. He alway=\r\ns slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep=\r\n on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to sl=\r\neep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cul=\r\nt. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, and they w=\r\near a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This is\n Vair=\r\nagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Ta=\r\npas. They have got a physical body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is another great Vairagi, =\r\nour Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to =\r\ntake food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after meals. &qu=\r\not;Avadhootas&quot; are naked people. They have no clothing or home. Real A=\r\nvadhoota is one who has shaved his mind of all Vasanas. When all Vasanas ar=\r\ne destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra Swami lived a very austere =\r\nlife.
