Is it \n&gt; ok?...\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree in principle what you suggest in email about faster progress, \n&gt; but, there are so many ways to realize god, bhakti, nam sankirtan, \n&gt; manav seva or any type of seva or mantra yoga, hath yoga etc. There \n&gt; are so many, I am sure I cannot list all.\n&gt; \n&gt; It depends on the sanskars or accumulated impressions of a sadhak as \n&gt; to which path will help better, we donot know that for sure except \n&gt; for Siddha Sadaguru.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also a lot of people donot even have means to eat or cloth how will \n&gt; they do homam, even if they read this on the internet? What will \n&gt; happen to their feelings and mind. Does that mean they cannot realize \n&gt; God in a speedy way?\n&gt; \n&gt; Along with Parashara we also have bhagvatam which signifies in \n&gt; kaliyuga naam sankirtan and similar other documents offer other \n&gt; methods, all these are equally important and valuable.\n&gt; \n&gt; A good way is to accept all paths that lead to self realization\n&gt; and suggest that homan is also a very good way. I hope that you \n&gt; please accept this in a positive way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very Happy Shivratri to you and all members.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Along the lines of other short homam manuals that are available on \n&gt; the homam website below, a short Shiva homam manual is available now. \n&gt; This homam is simple and short enough to be performed daily or weekly \n&gt; or monthly.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; It has many options for the main mantra used. Instead of doing a \n&gt; little of each mantra and covering many mantras, I suggest picking \n&gt; any ONE mantra and doing it as many times as one can. If one is \n&gt; unable to choose a mantra, I suggest Mrityunjaya mantra. If one wants \n&gt; a simpler mantra, I suggest &quot;Om hreem namashshivaaya&quot;. However, there \n&gt; are many options in the manual.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; My advance greetings for a happy Maha Shivaratri!\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; It is hoped that spiritual seekers take advantage of this manual.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Company of fire has a highly beneficial effect on mind and homam \n&gt; (fire ritual) is far more effective than japam (meditation) in \n&gt; purifying mind and removing obstacles. Almost all the remedial \n&gt; measures (upayas) taught by Maharshi Parasara in Brihat Parasara Hora \n&gt; Sastram (BPHS) involve homam and not japam. As the internal purifying \n&gt; fire within individuals becomes weaker with deepening Kali yuga, \n&gt; value of external fire in meditation increases. Meditation without an \n&gt; external fire is much slower and less efficient for most people.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Homam manuals for Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Krishna, Mahalakshmi, \n&gt; Saturn and Mars are already there on the website. We will slowly add \n&gt; manuals for more deities.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
