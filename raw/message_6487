More than the ingredients, such a ritual itself needs to =\r\nbe authenticated by someone who can see/touch the subtle side. The whole ri=\r\ntual could be benefit of the universe rather than individual as in Athirath=\r\nram etc, but also the point is some of these yajna&#39;s if wrongly done is sup=\r\nposed to have repercussions.

I certainly hope so, for this seems a really lovely idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ma=\r\nin difficulty I see in crafting such a rite is the offering itself, as ther=\r\ne doesn&#39;t even seem to be agreement among long-time scholars as to what Som=\r\na actually was/is.  Of course, there are substitutes - the plant(s?) used a=\r\nt the recent Kerala athirathram, for example - but what might a person use =\r\nif living in an area where such species are unavailable?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m willing t=\r\no help, though my knowledge is very small.\n&gt; \n&gt; Leila\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shashi_nambisan&quot; &lt;shashin@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Na=\r\nrasimha and all\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    I happened to come across the AGNI book by Frit=\r\nz Staal which has details of &#39;Atirathram&#39;. It is great work of 2 volumes ar=\r\nound 700+ pages each, containing great details of the Yajna, but still lack=\r\ning full details. The preparation for this is very huge and  equally expens=\r\nive , since they start with making vessels and items required as per the sp=\r\necifications at the site and many involving recitations of specific mantras=\r\n along with it. It made me think\n&gt; &gt; whether it is even possible to make a =\r\nsmall Soma Yajna manual which one could do individually, albeit occasionall=\r\ny, like the various Havir Yajnas or Homa manuals made by Narasimha Manish a=\r\nnd others!
