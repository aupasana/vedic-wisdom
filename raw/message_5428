Naths are also known as Mahasiddhas. These are not =\r\nordinary beings. Nath means Lord or master. Depending on how you count them=\r\n, there are either 64 or 9 of them, incarnated from various transcendental =\r\nqualities of the Lord. These are adept beings with perfect mastery over var=\r\nious aspects of the field of duality. They are ever-liberated and yet are b=\r\norn again and again to show the path of liberation to people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Lord Da=\r\nttatreya is the original guru of all Naths. Please read his &quot;Avadhoota Gita=\r\n&quot;. There is a nice English translation by Swami Asokananda (I think) of Ram=\r\nakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is better if one knows Sanskrit =\r\nand reads Sanskrit verses directly, because there is some special power in =\r\nthe combinations of words used and reading them in that form has a special =\r\nimpact. If one reads Avadhoota Gita, one will realize that what I&#39;ve been w=\r\nriting on the goal of sadhana is consistent with what Avadhoota Gita says. =\r\nSo is it with what Maharshi Vasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham!\n&gt;  \n&gt; While=\r\n Dattatreya says &quot;I am this body, I am that body and I am all bodies and ye=\r\nt I am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to think that Gorakshanath (from Dattatrey=\r\na&#39;s lineage!) would set as ultimate goal making a specific body immortal. T=\r\nhis is a gross misrepresentation of Gorakshanath and his teachings. In fact=\r\n, anynody who thinks one can understand the essence of a Nath&#39;s teaching fr=\r\nom a book or a verse is fooling oneself. Only those who are meant for it ca=\r\nn benefit from the guidance of a Nath. Others can only see the superficial =\r\naspects of the words attributed to a Nath. To say that Gorakhnath&#39;s path is=\r\n about achieving &quot;Kayasiddhi&quot; is totally wrong. Gorakshanath&#39;s path is abou=\r\nt liberation while living, which is described in Avadhoota Gita, Yoga Vaasi=\r\nshtham and several other scriptures, and that does NOT mean physical immort=\r\nality.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One understanding the true essence of the teachings of Goraksh=\r\nanath, Matsyendranath and Dattatreya and following their teachings perfectl=\r\ny may indeed get various siddhis though one may not actively want them. As =\r\nVasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham, various siddhis in the field of duality=\r\n are irrelevant to a seeker of liberation and they can even become hindranc=\r\nes. But, one truly understanding the teachings of Naths and Dattatreya will=\r\n not succumb to them and will become like Shiva. My point is that one who s=\r\ntarts off thinking that physical immoortality of a specific physical body (=\r\nor another siddhi like that) is the goal is going to get stuck at some stag=\r\ne.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Liberation is lack of attraction or aversion to anything in the fi=\r\neld of duality - an object or an idea or a notion. Either rejection of ever=\r\nything as an illusion or acceptance of everything as divine can make one ev=\r\nentually overcome all attractions and aversions. Thinking of immortalizing =\r\none particular physical body will not help one with that. In fact, a realiz=\r\ned person will not think &quot;I am this body&quot;, as the quote above from Dattatre=\r\nya shows.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, the verse quoted below says one becomes like Shiva=\r\n in the end. Did Shiva strive for physical immortality? When Shiva came to =\r\nearth as Adi Shankara, he did not teach physical immortality. Instead, he t=\r\naught that body is mithya (an illusion).\n&gt;  \n&gt; As I said, siddhas like Tril=\r\ninga Swami could manifest their physical bodies in two places at the same t=\r\nime. Why Trilinga Swami, my guru&#39;s guru (Sri Nakhate Maharaj) did that. One=\r\nday, my guru Manish saw his guru standing in front of him in physical body,=\r\n showing hand in a blessing pose and then waving it as a good bye sign. Man=\r\nish later found out that other disciples of Nakhate maharaj living in vario=\r\nus parts of the world saw a similar scene at the same time and that Maharaj=\r\n gave up his physical body in Pune at that time! If one is indeed a siddha =\r\n(let alone a natha) and has some control over matter, it may be possible to=\r\n menifest and unmanifest perishable physical bodies at will.

Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical psudo-ve=\r\ndantin of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical body=\r\n is to be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical body a=\r\nnd we are something else residing in a shell called the physical body. What=\r\n we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physical bod=\r\ny may perish. But, if someone currently thinks that one is a physical body,=\r\n one cannot simply ignore the physical body. One has to *use* the physical =\r\nbody to eventually realize that one is not the physical body. A mere intell=\r\nectual statement of it is not tantamount to its realization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha cle=\r\narly says that action (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are two wings with whi=\r\nch the bird of individualized consciousness flies into the sky of self-real=\r\nization. Physical body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and =\r\ncarefully to perform the *right actions* that can free one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions without correct knowledge (t=\r\nhat god is the doer of all actions!) is like a person who is walking around=\r\n a mountain not realizing that the goal of walking is to reach the top. Suc=\r\nh a person will keep walking forever and not reach the top. On the other ha=\r\nnd, one having the correct knowledge but not performing actions is like som=\r\neone who knows that reaching the top of the mountain is the goal and keeps =\r\nstaring at the top, without walking. Such a person will remain at the base =\r\nof the mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone are not able to free one and =\r\nthat is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird. The equilibrium=\r\n caused by action and knowledge is what takes us towards liberation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical bodies of some siddhas may=\r\n indeed remain intact for a long time, like centuries or millennia. But, ev=\r\nentually, they too may give up physical body. Someone mentioned Vallalar, b=\r\nut he gave up physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, to a =\r\ntruly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortality will sound =\r\nsilly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modifications such as =\r\nphysical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A siddha, as lo=\r\nng as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in an individual=\r\nized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a physical bod=\r\ny. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge back in the ethe=\r\nreal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So, what=\r\n is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trilinga S=\r\nwami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bhai=\r\n of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to Varana=\r\nsi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dak=\r\nshineshwar and taught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga =\r\nSwami. Later, a grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami=\r\n a big container full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his impris=\r\nonment by the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some gua=\r\nrds to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the s=\r\name time. Even when he finally decided to give up his body and his disciple=\r\ns put his body in a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen after a=\r\n few minutes to walk on the other side.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized b=\r\neing with a high enough command over duality, creation and destruction of p=\r\nhysical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks that a g=\r\nold coin is special and needs to be preserved forever will struggle to do s=\r\no.

Preserving the coin forever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did no=\r\nt get those abilities because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them spec=\r\nifically.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether =\r\nX realizes non-dual Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is th=\r\ne same. But, if one retains individual ego-consciousness and interacts with=\r\n the field of duality, different possibilities are there. One may engage in=\r\n various actions using a physical body and at the end drop the ego-consciou=\r\nsness and merge in Brahman. Or, one may engage in various actions using a p=\r\nhysical body, then give it up and tie the ego-consciousness to an ethereal =\r\nbody and remain in a higher realm for a long time. If so, one may re-enter =\r\na physical body from time to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s calib=\r\ner and evolution in the field of duality. Though, all are the same at the n=\r\non-dual level, different beings have different caliber in the field of dual=\r\nity. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be the same as somebo=\r\ndy else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, bu=\r\nt I am afraid he lent himself vulnerable to misinterpretation when it comes=\r\n to divinization of matter. I say quite emphatically that physical immortal=\r\nity as an ideal and as the end goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realiz=\r\ne Self and, if needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do whate=\r\nver comes spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning is overcome, Nature star=\r\nts to show one the role one has to play. One should just play the role give=\r\nn to one well, instead of asking for this role or that role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
