If you are living in western or westernized world, \n&gt; jus=\r\nt make sure that the fruit doesn&#39;t have too much chemicals. For \n&gt; example,=\r\n apples available in most stores in US have fertilizers and a \n&gt; wax coatin=\r\ng. Bananas also have artificial chemicals. Organic fruits are \n&gt; better for=\r\n offering in homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, the same can b=\r\ne said about the internal digestive fire. \n&gt; Offering food tainted with che=\r\nmicals and poisons in it is not good. \n&gt; There will be more and more people=\r\n suffering from so many minor and \n&gt; major health problems, due to these ch=\r\nemicals in processed as well as \n&gt; supposedly fresh food. Modern corporatio=\r\nns process food with chemicals \n&gt; to maximize shelf life and manipulate the=\r\n ripening process to maximize \n&gt; their profits and government regulators on=\r\nly stop things that are \n&gt; conclusively proven to be bad for health and fai=\r\nl to catch so many bad \n&gt; chemicals that are not yet conclusively proven to=\r\n be bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you eat processed/fresh food tainted with chemicals, atlea=\r\nst work on \n&gt; helping your liver. Liver is the filter in the digestive syst=\r\nem and \n&gt; struggles with all these chemicals. Things like karela (bitter me=\r\nlon), \n&gt; neem, rhubarb, dandelion root etc and tablets like Liv 52 (from Hi=\r\nmalaya \n&gt; ayurvedic pharmaceuticals) and herbs like Kutki and Bhumyamlaki (=\r\nor even \n&gt; normal amla/gooseberry) help the liver. Also, living a less stre=\r\neful \n&gt; life and spending some calm time (e.g. meditation and pranayama) wi=\r\nll \n&gt; help liver.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; We are usually strict about=\r\n what we offer in homam fire, but more \n&gt; indiscriminate about offering foo=\r\nd to internal fire. For example, we \n&gt; offer saattwik food in homam (e.g. n=\r\no onions, spices etc), but most of \n&gt; us eat raajasik and taamasik food.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; My guru&#39;s guru&#39;s guru&#39;s guru Sri Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj, also \n=\r\n&gt; known as Tembe Swami, used to eat only what could be offered in homam. \n&gt;=\r\n Before he ate any food, he would offer it in his homam fire and then \n&gt; on=\r\nly eat it. Not only did he avoid food containing raajasik or taamasik \n&gt; ma=\r\nterials, but he he avoided food affected by such thoughts. If he \n&gt; detecte=\r\nd some negative thoughts in the room from someone, he would not \n&gt; eat food=\r\n tainted with those thoughts and instead fast that day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such strict se=\r\nlf-discipline ensured yogis of yore to have a very high \n&gt; level of spiritu=\r\nal purity.
