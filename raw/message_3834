I=\r\n am just illiterate in this subject, although I will like to put my view in=\r\n the regard of celibacy and food consumed during saadhna.\n\nEvery type of ta=\r\npas produce energy in our mind and body. To be able to absorb and sustain t=\r\nhis energy we need a stable mind. Any thing like sex, non-veg food, intoxic=\r\nants or any other similar thing cause instability in mind, obviously except=\r\n for those who know how to handle them. So it is best to avoid such things =\r\natleast for the newbies like us so that we can sustain, absorb and use the =\r\nspiritual energy in more efficient way.\n\nIT is like we are filling water in=\r\n a container. If the container is leaking, we will loose all the water and =\r\nin some cases this water can also mess our clothes. So it is better to make=\r\n the container leak proof so that we can really handle our energy well. It =\r\nis necessary for the newbies who have very less water in start and every dr=\r\nop is precious.\n\nIn addition, growing a beard can also be a good idea.\n\nPle=\r\nase forgive me if I sound rude.\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, manish gour &lt;manishgo_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello biswa,\n&gt; Here =\r\nare some tips which may help.\n&gt; 1. +1/-1 hours from sunrise/sunset are good=\r\n time to do the homam as per Narasimha. It is good if you stick to same tim=\r\ne for doing homam everyday.\n&gt; 2. You can purchase ready made havan samagri =\r\nfrom Arya samaj mandir. It costs 40 Rs/Kg. here in nagpur and it is of very=\r\n good quality. 1Kg of this samagri can be used for some time.\n&gt; 3. I use wo=\r\nod sticks for homam which costs Rs 10/Kg. I generally find the fire getting=\r\n weak during the time of tarpana/bali during homam. For that you may put so=\r\nme coconut pieces to keep the fire burning. You can use coconut pieces to k=\r\neep the fire burning for more time.\n&gt; 4. My general=C2=A0experience=C2=A0is=\r\n that Brahmacharya is an important activity in any sadhana especially in ca=\r\nse of Ganapati ji and Hanuman ji.\n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- =\r\nOn Tue, 2/3/10, biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: biswa108 &lt;biswa1=\r\n975@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Ganapati Homam - Need some pra=\r\nctical approach...\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, 2 Ma=\r\nrch, 2010, 8:14 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       NAMASKAR to all\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama for the last three weeks, c=\r\nredit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of this beautiful forum..=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now I need some practical approach best suitable for me...\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Suggested / Suitable time to perform ganapati homam(currently, I=\r\n am performing around the time of sunrise, is it suitable at night or befor=\r\ne sunrise too?)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. What substance should not be offered in Ganap=\r\nati homam (bel-leaves should be one in the list, I unknowingly used it and =\r\nexperience very bad effects!) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. When the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; g=\r\noing on, is it really needed to perform &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati =\r\nhomam? if someone can control his/her thinkings during ganapati homam, sex/=\r\nmasturbating/ consume non-veg food is really needed? (In my practical exper=\r\nience, consume very low-diet little food at last night are excellent for pe=\r\nrforming Ganapati Homama in the morning. my point is, readying our body/min=\r\nd 5-6 hours before the homama procedure by controlling sex/food are very mu=\r\nch useful for me!)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Is there any practical methods to keep the=\r\n fire more times in the homam kundam so that more time to spend on meditati=\r\non?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Is there any cost effective solutions for daily homam in =\r\nKolkata, India? Sometimes I find expensive for daily ganapati homam. We may=\r\n ask to create a group in Kolkata to use our cumulative purchasing capacity=\r\n for cheap rate. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n   \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personality.
