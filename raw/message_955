To condition and remind our minds of our\n=\r\n&gt; divine origin. True worship of God means only one thing =96the\ncultivatio=\r\nn of\n&gt; nobility in thoughts, motives, speech and action. If you think that =\r\nby\n&gt; worshiping a particular God you will gain material success or fulfill =\r\na\n&gt; specific desire=96=96 then it is a wrong delusion. Worshiping God with\n=\r\nsincerity\n&gt; results in enhancement of virtues like generosity, compassion a=\r\nnd\nwarmth in\n&gt; your psyche. It brings about a positive change in the attitu=\r\nde of the\n&gt; devotee towards life. If you have not performed worship in its =\r\ntrue\nsense,\n&gt; then you are likely to be lost in a maze of lifeless mechanic=\r\nal rituals.\n&gt; \n&gt; You should worship in such a way that you also get the gif=\r\nts of grace\n&gt; bestowed on true devotees present and past. Your virtues, cha=\r\nracter,\n&gt; actions, behaviour, thoughts and sentiments must improve as a res=\r\nult of\n&gt; worship. This is what shows the activation of divinity in life. If=\r\n you\n&gt; attain this state, great opportunities will knock at your door. Glan=\r\nce\n&gt; through the cultural history of India =96=96 all the great names in it=\r\n\nare of\n&gt; those who served the noble cause for the good of all and not of\nt=\r\nhose who\n&gt; earned scholastic laurels. Have you heard of Mahamana Malviyaji?=\r\n He\nwas an\n&gt; ordinary person who became a great personage through sincere\n&gt;=\r\n worship of divinity as he conceived it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Friends! When God is pleased,=\r\n He does not give you the petty worldly\nthings\n&gt; you hanker after. Rather, =\r\nHe bestows on you godlike qualities which\nelevate\n&gt; your soul. The lives of=\r\n world&#39;s really great personage demonstrate this\n&gt; fact. None among them wa=\r\ns such who did not receive God&#39;s grace,\nguidance and\n&gt; cooperation of the m=\r\nasses they served. Give me one name of a great\n&gt; personality who was not en=\r\ndowed with any godly qualities of compassion,\n&gt; love, faith and service and=\r\n who did not elicit spontaneous and loving\n&gt; cooperation from those who fol=\r\nlowed him. The noble values and\nprinciples of\n&gt; morality, ethics and sponta=\r\nneity when adopted in conduct, help in\n&gt; enhancements of talents and resour=\r\nces. Saints adhere to great ideals\nof god\n&gt; like lives. They are never poor=\r\n; required resources arrive at their\n&gt; doorstep. But they do not accumulate=\r\n them; they generously share\nthem with\n&gt; the needy.\n&gt; \n&gt; When our minds are=\r\n cleansed of all impurities and perversions, our\nmaterial\n&gt; and inner resou=\r\nrces are augmented. How many examples should I\nmention? The\n&gt; life of every=\r\none who followed the ideal path of love-in-action and\nselfless\n&gt; service ex=\r\nemplifies this fact. They are true devotees in my view. I\nconsider\n&gt; the wo=\r\nrship and devotion of only those as true and worthwhile who could\n&gt; attract=\r\n divine energies of their deity by the nobility of their\ncharacter,\n&gt; by th=\r\ne magnetism of their virtues and by their single-minded\ndetermination\n&gt; at =\r\nself-refinement and self-effacement When deities are happy with your\n&gt; wors=\r\nhip, they bless you with the attributes of a divine being:\nenlightened\n&gt; wi=\r\nsdom, compassion and selfless service. My concept of worhsip and\ndivine\n&gt; b=\r\nlessings is somewhat different. I can say that a true devotee can\nattract\n&gt;=\r\n divine energies by the force of his nobility; he can compel deities\nto hel=\r\np\n&gt; in pursuit of his noble aims. A true devotee in this sense is much\nstro=\r\nnger\n&gt; a deity; he can get God&#39;s help whenever he asks as his right. God ca=\r\nnnot\n&gt; ignore his call.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who worship god begging for a few worldl=\r\ny possessions or for\n&gt; fulfillment of ego-centric desires can&#39;t be true dev=\r\notees even if\nthey spend\n&gt; all their time in prayers and rituals. Glad cons=\r\nent to God&#39;s will is the\n&gt; real spirit of devotion; it is the prime conditi=\r\non to be fulfilled\nfor being\n&gt; a devotee in its true sense. God has inalter=\r\nably assured His\ndevotee, in the\n&gt; Gita- &quot;yogakshemam vah=E1myaham&quot; I will =\r\nprovide for all your needs.\nTrue, God\n&gt; does take care of his devotee but H=\r\ne has not promised to satisfy his\n&gt; cravings. &quot;Yoga&quot; and &quot;kshema&quot; mean taki=\r\nng care of your physical, mental,\n&gt; intellectual and spiritual well-being.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; There should not be any confusion that it (God&#39;s arrivance) includes t=\r\nhe\n&gt; fulfillment of your gross sensual hunger. Don&#39;t chase the mirage of\npa=\r\nssions\n&gt; and desires; it devalues the dignity of devotion and the pre-emine=\r\nnce of\n&gt; God&#39;s grace. The relation between the deity and the devotee is\ngra=\r\nceful and\n&gt; dignified only when the devotee doesn&#39;t beg for anything but ra=\r\nther\noffers\n&gt; to entirely give himself to the divine. God has already given=\r\n you so\nmuch!\n&gt; He has created you. He is always taking care of your yoga-k=\r\nshema,\nwithout\n&gt; your praying for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; God is not a particularly embodi=\r\ned being. It is we who have\nconceived Him in\n&gt; various forms. If it is a mu=\r\nst to give a definition, God could only be\n&gt; vaguely described as &quot;an infin=\r\nite ensemble of supreme moral principles,\n&gt; saintly ideals and nobility&quot;. F=\r\naith in divine values and ideals and a\n&gt; self-disciplined endeavour to live=\r\n for high principles is true\ndevotion and\n&gt; enlightened worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; *All =\r\nyou really need will be provided*\n&gt; \n&gt; Transparency of character is a great=\r\n asset of a person through which\nhe gets\n&gt; abundant support, affection and =\r\nco-operation from all quarters.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is real prosperity. Can any monet=\r\nary or material resources ever\nprovide\n&gt; it? People donated unasked all the=\r\nir wealth and resources at the feet of\n&gt; Buddha, moved by his compassion an=\r\nd absolute selflessness. Gandhiji&#39;s\n&gt; benevolence, his missionary zeal, his=\r\n aspirations were all aimed at the\n&gt; welfare of the lowliest and the lost. =\r\nThis, together with the\nimpeccability\n&gt; of his character, made him a univer=\r\nsally acclaimed mahatma.\n&gt; \n&gt; People from all strata of the society stood b=\r\ny him, cooperated with\nhim and\n&gt; followed him. Millions of people voluntari=\r\nly went to jails and\nsacrificed\n&gt; their lives for the noble cause of nation=\r\nal freedom upon his call.\nIs such\n&gt; ethical and spiritual eminence attainab=\r\nle by us all? Yes, indeed,\nsubject to\n&gt; only one condition =96 you too like=\r\n mahatma, should be ready to be led by\n&gt; truth dwelling light of the spirit=\r\n. Light, your shadow will follow\nyou. But\n&gt; you seem to be chasing your own=\r\n shadow, the shadow of m=E1y=E1 =96 illusive\n&gt; worldly attractions and atta=\r\nchments =96 that seem to have overwhelmed\nyou. You\n&gt; should learn to walk t=\r\nowards the light, towards God, noble aims and\nideals.\n&gt; Such ideals are the=\r\n attributes of deities like Hanuman and other\nemanations\n&gt; of God.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fri=\r\nends, turn away from the mirage of cravings, passions, greed and\n&gt; disconte=\r\nntment, and let your prayers and worship reach the stage\nwhere your\n&gt; perso=\r\nnality would be illumined by God&#39;s light, by the glow of\ndivinity. This\n&gt; i=\r\ns true devotion. If you have cultivated virtuous tendencies and\nconduct, I\n=\r\n&gt; assure you that you will get support and cooperation from people\naround y=\r\nou.\n&gt; Boons of enlightened progress will be showered upon you from all\ndire=\r\nctions.\n&gt; This is what has been, and will continue to be, the source of God=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; blessings, the blessings of divine mother Gayatri. This has been the\ng=\r\nreat\n&gt; tradition of devotion and of devotees and will be so in the future\nt=\r\noo. If\n&gt; you understand this secret and learn the true meaning of worship a=\r\nnd\n&gt; devotion, your Gayatri  Anushthan here will be accomplished in the\ntru=\r\nest\n&gt; sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; The self disciplining practices of this Anushthan s=E1dha=\r\nn=E1 are meant to\n&gt; refine your personality so that virtuous tendencies flo=\r\nurish in you.\nIf this\n&gt; tapashcary=E1 of yours is sincere and one-pointed t=\r\nhen at the end of this\n&gt; Anushthan you will feel inwardly endowed with godl=\r\ny attributes of an\n&gt; authentically virtuous and noble person. When a person=\r\n imbibes an\nattitude\n&gt; of loving service, he sees his own good in the welfa=\r\nre of others and\n&gt; experiences happiness in it. If you find them elevated i=\r\nn this state of\n&gt; nobility, I would say you have attained true devotion and=\r\n grace of\nthe god.\n&gt; \n&gt; You would be blessed by God, just as the great devo=\r\ntees of the past have\n&gt; been. I have tried and followed this path and have =\r\nbeen blessed with\nsublime\n&gt; gifts in my life. I want all of you, who have c=\r\nome for this s=E1dhan=E1\ncourse\n&gt; of a condensed Anushthan, to get inspired=\r\n and be blessed by divine\ngrace. If\n&gt; this inspires you and you begin to pr=\r\nactice it, I assure you that\nthe result\n&gt; will be so fulfilling, so majesti=\r\nc that you, your country, your\nlife, your\n&gt; God, this s=E1dhan=E1 course an=\r\nd I myself will be glorified. May God\nbless you\n&gt; with his grace.\n&gt; \n&gt; *||\n=\r\nOM&lt;http://www.akhandjyoti.org/?Akhand-Jyoti/2003/Mar-Apr/AwakeningDivinity/=\r\n?Akhand-Jyoti/2004/July-Aug/ExperiencingOm/&gt;SHANTI\n&gt; ||\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
