He got it from some\n&gt; source and started giving Ahutis with the Mantra=\r\n during his Maha-Ganapati\n&gt; Homam. As he has written, First day he had trou=\r\nbles in office and 2nd day\n&gt; his bike was stolen resulting in his shaken co=\r\nnfidence due to obvious\n&gt; worries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Looking at the situation, IM=\r\nHO, it is very early to think about\n&gt; stopping the same. Though intentions =\r\nfor specifically invoking Mother\n&gt; Bagalamukhi is not known, I believe that=\r\n it was for some or the other\n&gt; Saatwik desire (Even it may have been munda=\r\nne and not speeding up spiritual\n&gt; progress). Also, it defies the logic to =\r\nattach incidences to Homam with\n&gt; experiences of just a couple of days.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; For that matter, even Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if I take my own\n=\r\n&gt; personal experiences. I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati Homas as wel=\r\nl\n&gt; as Chandi homas and I have had many set backs and some good things as w=\r\nell\n&gt; but again those are all part & parcel of life. Even without Homam, on=\r\ne may\n&gt; experience such dualistic situations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand your=\r\n insistence and your prudent advice to worship Soumya\n&gt; Devatas and I agree=\r\n to your logic which is most probably out of your\n&gt; experiences, however I =\r\nalso think that Ugra Devata should not be that\n&gt; fearful while Soumya Devat=\r\nas are not that Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all\n&gt; about attraction/likin=\r\ng for a particular deity. It is my personal view that\n&gt; one needs to decide=\r\n upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or\n&gt; Ugra-Soumya in externa=\r\nl Nature) to which one feels most attracted and then\n&gt; forget about the res=\r\nt. It would be a destabilizing effect on mind of a\n&gt; person to start judgin=\r\ng and relating day to day experiences with homam. The\n&gt; chosen deity can be=\r\n Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman\n&gt; or any other deit=\r\ny. Once person starts surrendering to the chosen deity, one\n&gt; is in safe ha=\r\nnds. Even if things starts going wrong, one need not despair\n&gt; and should k=\r\neep faith till it is impossible because if God exist, there\n&gt; never would b=\r\ne a breaking point and that holds true for all of us whether we\n&gt; have fami=\r\nlies to look after or not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I completely tend to agree and hence repea=\r\nt for benefits of others that\n&gt; Ganapati is not a Lower devata. He is capab=\r\nle of everything. If one has a\n&gt; great liking for him, one can keep on perf=\r\norming his homam without need of\n&gt; switching. Actually to switch from Maha-=\r\nGanapati Homam to some other deity\n&gt; is NOT changing of Levels (especially =\r\nfrom Lower to upper) which some may\n&gt; think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The point ra=\r\nised by Biswajit is a genuine one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress requi=\r\nres freedom from the burden of some key\n&gt; blocking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas. One way =\r\nto be free from a karma is to experience the reaction\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it in fu=\r\nll (in due course of time). Another way is to burn it in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana. W=\r\nhen one meditates or helps people or engages in various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual p=\r\nractices also, some karmas are getting burnt and being\n&gt; taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off =\r\none&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like homam accelerate that\n&gt; process.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Homam of ugra devatas accelerates it further. The distinction is\n&gt; betw=\r\neen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas and ugra devatas is a very important one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I gave this analogy a few times before. Suppose there is a basket=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; containing fruits (your karmas). Suppose a good fruit (good karma)=\r\n is\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuck under some rotten fruits (bad karmas). When you do sadh=\r\nana, the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity (personification of certain good qualities within =\r\nyou, which\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being strengthened as you do the sadhana) re-arran=\r\nges the kaarmik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of the analogy, some rotten frui=\r\nts are taken out\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thrown in garbage and the good fruit is give=\r\nn to you to eat. If this\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done slowly and carefully, it takes l=\r\nonger to take the good fruit\n&gt; out,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the spillage of rotten frui=\r\nt pieces on the floor is minimized.\n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the way of soumya dev=\r\natas (gentle deities). If this is done fast\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aggressively, the=\r\n good fruit comes out faster, but the spillage of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruit piec=\r\nes is more. This is the way of ugra devatas (fierce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deities). It is=\r\n a tradeoff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I recommended before,=\r\n those who want their material life to go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smoothly and not in a hur=\r\nry for spiritual progress should stick to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas. Ganapathi=\r\n, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vishnu, Krishna etc\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be worshipped in fi=\r\nre. Once one starts worshipping fierce forms like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi, Durga, Na=\r\nrasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, especially\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire, thing=\r\ns CAN be too fast for them to handle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, it is a good=\r\n idea to just stick to Ganapathi homam for a few\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months, before s=\r\ntarting to worship any other deity. There is no need\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be in a h=\r\nurry to &quot;graduate&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else.\n&gt; Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is =\r\nnow lower and is capable of giving everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most people today do not understand Mahavidyas at all. For exampl=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on literal meanings of some scriptural sayings, they think=\r\n that\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bagalamukhi is for success over enemies and success in liti=\r\ngation\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people suggest specific Mahavidya sadhanas for m=\r\naterial benefits\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on horoscopic combinations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Vidya means knowledge. Mahavidya means supreme knowledge. No\n&gt; knowledge\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that enables one to win court cases or defeat enemies or to get oth=\r\ner\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary material results can be termed as &quot;supreme&quot; knowledg=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are far more serious. They stand for different aspect=\r\ns of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge of Self, which is the only supreme knowledge. =\r\nThey are the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberating forms of the divine Mother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Most people on earth today are unready for their worship. People\n&gt; today\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; need deities who can take care of material things and give some push=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serious liberating forces such as Mahavidy=\r\nas\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inappropriate for one who worries about little things. I m=\r\nean no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disrespect - worrying about little things is not unusual for=\r\n most\n&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and is ok - but then think twice before worshipping =\r\nMahavidyas,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially in a fruitful medium such as fire. Fire ampl=\r\nifies the\n&gt; impact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the mantra and surrounding thoughts on the su=\r\nbtle body and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accelerates the results, compared to normal meditatio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the above words carefully=\r\n and skip ugra devatas and\n&gt; Mahavidyas,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; atleast for a while in the=\r\n beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in the beginning, some mistakes may be ma=\r\nde. Just as Shiva\n&gt; drank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the poison that came out first during the=\r\n churning of milky ocean,\n&gt; Guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives protection in the beginning.=\r\n If you have a spiritual guru,\n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of him/her before the homam.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think of me or my guru Dr Manish Pan=\r\ndit. Better\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Swami (Shri Vasudevananda Sa=\r\nraswati\n&gt; Maharaj),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Gulwani Maharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman Rao Da=\r\nttatreya Gulwani),\n&gt; Shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj and Manish Pandit.

He got it from some source and started giving Ahutis with the Mantr=\r\na during his Maha-Ganapati Homam. As he has written, First day he had troub=\r\nles in office and 2nd day his bike was stolen resulting in his shaken confi=\r\ndence due to obvious worries.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Looking at the=\r\n situation, IMHO, it is very early to think about stopping the same. Though=\r\n intentions for specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not known, I be=\r\nlieve that it was for some or the other Saatwik desire (Even it may have be=\r\nen mundane and not speeding up spiritual progress). Also, it defies the log=\r\nic to attach incidences to Homam with experiences of just a couple of days.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; For that matter, even Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if =\r\nI take my own personal experiences. I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati =\r\nHomas as well as Chandi homas and I have had many set backs and some good t=\r\nhings as well but again those are all part &amp; parcel of life. Even witho=\r\nut Homam, one may experience such dualistic situations.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I understand your insistence and your prudent advice to worship=\r\n Soumya Devatas and I agree to your logic which is most probably out of you=\r\nr experiences, however I also think that Ugra Devata should not be that fea=\r\nrful while Soumya Devatas are not that Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all a=\r\nbout attraction/liking for a particular deity. It is my personal view that =\r\none needs to decide upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-=\r\nSoumya in external Nature) to which one feels most attracted and then forge=\r\nt about the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on mind of a person to=\r\n start judging and relating day to day experiences with homam. The chosen d=\r\neity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any o=\r\nther deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chosen deity, one is in =\r\nsafe hands. Even if things starts going wrong, one need not despair and sho=\r\nuld keep faith till it is impossible because if God exist, there never woul=\r\nd be a breaking point and that holds true for all of us whether we have fam=\r\nilies to look after or not.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; I completely tend to agree and =\r\nhence repeat for benefits of others that Ganapati is not a Lower devata. He=\r\n is capable of everything. If one has a great liking for him, one can keep =\r\non performing his homam without need of switching. Actually to switch from =\r\nMaha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing of Levels (especial=\r\nly from Lower to upper) which some may think.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The point raised by Biswajit is a genuine one.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress requires freedom from the b=\r\nurden of some key blocking &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas. One way to be free f=\r\nrom a karma is to experience the reaction to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it in full=\r\n (in due course of time). Another way is to burn it in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsadhana. When one meditates or helps people or engages in various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; spiritual practices also, some karmas are getting burnt and bein=\r\ng taken &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off one&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like h=\r\nomam accelerate that process. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam of ugra devatas acc=\r\nelerates it further. The distinction is between &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya =\r\ndevatas and ugra devatas is a very important one.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; I gave this analogy a few times before. Suppose there is a ba=\r\nsket &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; containing fruits (your karmas). Suppose a good fr=\r\nuit (good karma) is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck under some rotten fruits (bad=\r\n karmas). When you do sadhana, the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity (personificati=\r\non of certain good qualities within you, which are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bein=\r\ng  strengthened as you do the sadhana) re-arranges the kaarmik &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of the analogy, some rotten fruits are taken out=\r\n and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thrown in garbage and the good fruit is given to y=\r\nou to eat. If this is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; done slowly and carefully, it tak=\r\nes longer to take the good fruit out, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but the spillage =\r\nof rotten fruit pieces on the floor is minimized. This &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nis the way of soumya devatas (gentle deities). If this is done fast and &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aggressively, the good fruit comes out faster, but the spi=\r\nllage of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruit pieces is more. This is the way o=\r\nf ugra devatas (fierce &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities). It is a tradeoff.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I recommended before, those who want their material l=\r\nife to go &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smoothly and not in a hurry for spiritual pro=\r\ngress should stick to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas. Ganapathi, Lakshm=\r\ni, Saraswati, Vishnu, Krishna etc can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be worshipped in =\r\nfire. Once one starts worshipping fierce forms like &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cha=\r\nndi, Durga, Narasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, especially in &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; fire, things CAN be too fast for them to handle.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, it is a good idea to just stick to Ganap=\r\nathi homam for a few &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, before starting to worship=\r\n any other deity. There is no need to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be in a hurry to =\r\n&quot;graduate&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else. Ganapathi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; is now lower and is capable of giving everything.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Most people today do not understand Mahavidyas at all. For example, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on literal meanings of some scriptural sayings, t=\r\nhey think that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bagalamukhi is for success over enemies =\r\nand success in litigation etc. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people suggest spec=\r\nific Mahavidya sadhanas for material benefits &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on =\r\nhoroscopic combinations.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vidya means=\r\n knowledge. Mahavidya means supreme knowledge. No knowledge &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; that enables one to win court cases or defeat enemies or to get other =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary material results can be termed as &quot;supre=\r\nme&quot; knowledge. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are far more serious. Th=\r\ney stand for different aspects of the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge of Self=\r\n, which is the only supreme knowledge. They are the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lib=\r\nerating forms of the divine Mother.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMost people on earth today are unready for their worship. People today &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need deities who can take care of material things and give =\r\nsome push &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serious liberatin=\r\ng forces such as Mahavidyas are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inappropriate for one w=\r\nho worries about little things. I mean no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disrespect - =\r\nworrying about little things is not unusual for most people &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and is ok - but then think twice before worshipping Mahavidyas, &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; especially in a fruitful medium such as fire. Fire amplifies =\r\nthe impact &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the mantra and surrounding thoughts on th=\r\ne subtle body and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accelerates the results, compared to =\r\nnormal meditation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *       =\r\n *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the above words carefull=\r\ny and skip ugra devatas and Mahavidyas, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; atleast for a w=\r\nhile in the beginning.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in the =\r\nbeginning, some mistakes may be made. Just as Shiva drank &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; the poison that came out first during the churning of milky ocean, Guru =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gives protection in the beginning. If you have a spirit=\r\nual guru, think &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of him/her before the homam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think of me or my gu=\r\nru Dr Manish Pandit. Better &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Sw=\r\nami (Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj), &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Gulwan=\r\ni Maharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman Rao Dattatreya Gulwani), Shri &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Nakhate Maharaj and Manish Pandit.
