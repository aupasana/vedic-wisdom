(Even if at the different plane of existence) =\r\nor the people\n&gt; who criticize are right when they say that yours is a full =\r\nof stories which are\n&gt; only mythological and you pray those imaginary Gods =\r\nwhich are nothing\n&gt; but characters of Stories of some writer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could =\r\nnot answer the question as i was not sure.\n \nThis somehow reminds of a ques=\r\ntion posed by Balaram Basu to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakri=\r\nshna&#39;s divine vision, Balaram Basu belonged in a previous birth to the inne=\r\nr circle of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu! Balaram Basu was very devout and pious, d=\r\nid many austerities and spent many years serving saints at Puri, away from =\r\nhis hometown of Calcutta. Yet, he had his doubts on the existence of god.\n =\r\n\nWhen he met Ramakrishna for the first time, he sat in a corner and listene=\r\nd to Ramakrishna&#39;s words. When other people in the room left, Ramakrishna t=\r\nurned to Balaram and asked him, &quot;Is there anything you want to ask me?&quot;\n \nB=\r\nalaram asked, &quot;Yes, sir. Does God really exist?&quot; Ramakrishna answered, &quot;Cer=\r\ntainly He does.&quot; Balaram asked, &quot;Can a person see Him?&quot;\n \nRamakrishna said,=\r\n &quot;Yes, He reveals Himself to the devotee who thinks of Him as his nearest a=\r\nnd dearest. Because you do not get any response by praying to Him once, you=\r\n must not conclude that He does not exist.&quot;\n \nBalaram asked, &quot;But why can&#39;t=\r\n I see Him when I pray to Him so much?&quot;\n \nRamakrishna smiled and asked, &quot;Do=\r\n you really consider Him to be as dear to your heart as your own children?&quot;=\r\n\n \n&quot;No, sir&quot;, Balaram candidly answered, &quot;I never felt that strongly for Hi=\r\nm.&quot;\n \nRamakrishna then said in a sweet, convincing voice: &quot;Pray to God, thi=\r\nnking of Him as dearer than your own self. Truly I tell you, He is extremel=\r\ny fond of His devotees. He cannot but reveal Himself to them. He comes to a=\r\n person even before He is sought. If a person comes one step towards God, G=\r\nod comes ten steps towards that person. There is none more intimate and mor=\r\ne affectionate than God.&quot;\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs Ramakrishna once said,=\r\n one needs to think of god more than one thinks about parents, wife, childr=\r\nen and about oneself, all put together. Try to do that. Then you will find =\r\nthe answer to your question yourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The =\r\nproof of the pudding is in *your* eating it. If somebody else tells you tha=\r\nt the pudding exists and one can eat it, that information has very limited =\r\nuse. In order to convince yourself fully, you need to taste the pudding you=\r\nrself!\n \nThough all gods and their stories are maya from a strictly vedanti=\r\nc point of view, they are as much real as your own mind. If your mind is re=\r\nal, all gods and their stories are real. When mind is in various planes of =\r\nawareness, it is possible for the mind to become aware of gods and their pl=\r\nays.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn this context, I want to mention a small sto=\r\nry. Manish was approached by a Christian missionary in UK once. He asked Ma=\r\nnish if he was a Hindu. Then he told Manish about how Jesus Christ is the s=\r\non of the real god, how Hindus are praying to unreal and wrong gods and hen=\r\nce doomed and how followers of Jesus Christ will go o heaven, etc. Manish a=\r\nsked the person, &quot;have you seen god or Jesus Christ&quot;. The person was perple=\r\nxed and said no. Manish asked him &quot;how do you then know that what you say i=\r\ns true? Are you sure that you guys have understood Jesus Christ correctly a=\r\nnd not misrepresenting his teachings now?&quot; Then he mentioned calmly and con=\r\nfidently, &quot;Actually, I have seen Jesus Christ. If you want, I can show him =\r\nto you too. Do you want to see him?&quot; The missionary looked at him like a cr=\r\nazy person and simply ran away.\n \nSee, one who is waxing eloquent about rea=\r\nl god, son of god and heaven does not even think that it is possible for so=\r\nmeone to see Jesus Christ. When he was told that somebody saw Jesus and ask=\r\ned if he was interested in seeing, he thought the other person must be craz=\r\ny and just ran away! He wasn&#39;t even curious to pursue further and see what =\r\nthe other person was upto. He simply concluded the other person is crazy!\n =\r\n\nPeople these days, in many religions, have no faith. Even things that are =\r\nquite possible seem impossible to people of this age.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nThose who have seen the movie &quot;Lage Raho Munnabhai&quot; may recall how Sanja=\r\ny Dutt starts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and hears Gandhi while oth=\r\ners cannot. It is concluded at the end that the visions of Gandhi were hall=\r\nucinations caused by the attachment of the stressed out mind to Gandhi and =\r\nresulting chemical imbalance in the brain.\n \nLoosely speaking, one may say =\r\nthat seeing gods is similar. But the difference is that it is far more blis=\r\nsful. For another big difference, see the example:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n \nGod can be experienced as light, as soun=\r\nd or as a specific form similar to a human form, etc. In the above example,=\r\n one goddess was experienced as sound. It can certainly be a hallucination,=\r\n but the interesting thing is that another person had the same experience a=\r\nnd he knew that this first person had that experience!\n \n*        *        =\r\n*\n \nI will give another similar example. One person who does Chandi homam e=\r\nveryday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri Rama Navami mo=\r\nrning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some preparations=\r\n for the next day&#39;s homam (like he would do every night) and laid out some =\r\ndried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day&#39;s burnt ashes, =\r\nfor starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. In the middle=\r\n of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his body lying on the bed. He=\r\n then became aware of the homa kundam which was a few feet away on another =\r\nfloor. It felt like his body and homa kundam were linked. Then it felt like=\r\n suddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, at the same time, his energy r=\r\nose. As soon as that happened, he lost regular awareness of his body. He no=\r\n longer felt his body or homa kundam or energy in the body. He first felt l=\r\nike he lied with head down and legs up and then he became absolutely weight=\r\nless. Then he felt like he was a small point, a small particle. It felt lik=\r\ne Lord Hanuman pulled him up and he went very fast into a region filled wit=\r\nh bright light. He was a weightless particle floating in that light along w=\r\nith Lord Hanuman and nobody else. He, the small particle, started praying t=\r\no Lord Hanuman and remained in a blissful state for a while.\n \nSuddenly, fr=\r\nom somewhere, a thought came about his body being in a bedroom and fire in =\r\nhoma kundam. He wondered, &quot;was there fire in homa kundam really?&quot; This dist=\r\nurbed his state and his regular self-awareness (i.e. being aware of self as=\r\n a body) returned.\n \nThe interesting thing is this. When he went to his hom=\r\na kundam to do homam next morning, he saw that the dried coconut pieces pla=\r\nced there on the ashes previous night were burnt and completely black. It m=\r\neans there was indeed a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same procedure=\r\n everyday and placed coconut pieces on the ashes for the next day&#39;s homam b=\r\nefore sleeping, but such a thing never happened. Basically, there must have=\r\n been some ember left still from the previous morning, though he did not se=\r\ne any ember in the night and thought the fire went out completely. For some=\r\n reason, that unseen ember started up a small fire in the night and the coc=\r\nonut pieces caught fire. Though there is no way to know when that happened,=\r\n it is consistent with what he felt during the mystical experience! After d=\r\naily homam for a long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa =\r\nkundam. Moreover, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to h=\r\nis internal fire and developments related to it still affected his internal=\r\n fire and consciousness!\n \nWhen you do homam for a long time with the menta=\r\nl visualization linking that external fire to your internal fire, the relat=\r\nionship is formed over the time! What happens in that external fire does th=\r\nen affect your consciousness. Even if the fire goes and ember is left burie=\r\nd under the ash, that ember is still linked to your internal fire!! When so=\r\nmething happens in your internal fire, the same thing happens to the ember =\r\ntoo. And vice versa.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDear Utpal, one can see God fo=\r\nr sure. One can experience God in many forms. One can see god externally, i=\r\nn a limited form like a human form. One can see god internally, when shakti=\r\n (energy of self-awareness) rises to a specific place and becomes aware of =\r\nbeings in that place. One can experience god as an all-pervading light or s=\r\nound and experience oneself as a small part of that light or sound. There a=\r\nre many ways to perceive god, but the bottomline is that god does exist and=\r\n one can perceive god. I cannot show you god, but I can guarantee you that =\r\ngod exists and can be perceived in various forms.\n \nDo homam everyday with =\r\nsincerity. That will burn the blocking karmas. Eventually you will be able =\r\nto love god more than anything, including yourself. That is when the final =\r\nscreen will start to disappear. Nothing can be a substitute for spiritual s=\r\nadhana.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi na=\r\nndy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, April 24, 2009 1:5=\r\n3 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Our Deities and their stories (Deiti=\r\nes in different religions!)\n        Namaste Utpalji\n\n        I have had the=\r\n same experiences. Most of our puranic stories are made fun of by others. \n=\r\n\n        Well in most of the cases these questions are of malicious intent,=\r\n those don&#39;t bother me much, but at some point someone ask&#39;s these question=\r\ns genuinely.\n\n        I tried reading different opinions of different respe=\r\ncted saints and I found one explanation in the introuductory chapters on Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo&#39;s &quot;Secrets of the Vedas&quot;.\n\n        He opines indirectly that th=\r\ne Puranas are definitely a toned down version of what used to be the Vedic =\r\nknowledge. This was made this way for the oridinary people to understand an=\r\nd not leave the folds of Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism. That is wh=\r\ny not only these stories were &quot;made&quot; which were based on deeper spiritual s=\r\nymbolism generated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and mad=\r\ne easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskrit of the p=\r\nuranic age.\n\n        The reason Buddism could become such a threat to Hindu=\r\nism was because the people (priests) had reducded the Vedas to a book of me=\r\nre rituals. The Vedas are both internal and external, but the priests took =\r\nover the religion from the sages/mystics and reduced/neglected/forgot the i=\r\nnternal and relied solely on the external. That is why Buddha rejected the =\r\nVedas.\n        Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was a wrong=\r\n step in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice after =\r\nKrishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. However, the c=\r\noming of Buddha was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall spiritua=\r\nl evolution of this world by increasing the distance between God and man. \n=\r\n\n        So essentially, the Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood=\r\n movies as compared to the Vedas which were the Art films.\n\n        My pers=\r\nonal take on this: As far as they are able to induce spirituality in an ver=\r\ny average ordinary person from a village they are excellent. But at the sam=\r\ne time, if a Hindu who is not aware of the comprehensive nature of his own =\r\nscriptures, a poor, uneducated man, is told that his idols are mere stones =\r\nand his stories are cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily much beyo=\r\nnd all this, the idea of a single God, would be enough reason to make him s=\r\nwitch religions. It would sound very logical to him. Infact, this is how it=\r\n often happens.\n\n        Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need=\r\n to learn our religion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on te=\r\nlevision would do well to try and educate their followers about the compreh=\r\nensive/all inclusive nature of Hinduism instead of mere reciting the storie=\r\ns from teh Puranas.\n\n        -Regards\n         Rajarshi\n\n        The upsurg=\r\ne (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n        --- On Fri, 24/4/09=\r\n, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n\n          From: utpal patha=\r\nk &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n          Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Our Deitie=\r\ns and their stories (Deities in different religions!)\n          To: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Friday, 24 April, 2009, 10:02 AM\n\n\n  =\r\n        Namaste Narasimha Garu and friends,\n\n          Rajarshi&#39;s question =\r\nwas in some aspect similar to one question i was asked about a month ago. w=\r\nhile traveling back to home from office, one person asked me that what is t=\r\nhese stories of our Gods such as Ganapati and his story of being Shiva&#39;s so=\r\nn and cutting of head and replaced by elephant head etc...\n          Storie=\r\ns of Vishnu and like wise many gods and goddesses.

Stories in Devi Mahatmay are true?. Episode =\r\nof Daksh Yagya and Uma&#39;s self killing in yagya vedi out of anger and origin=\r\n of Shakti pithas are true?\n\n          Stories of Indra and other many gods=\r\n and goddesses are true?\n\n          Do they really exist? (Even if at the d=\r\nifferent plane of existence) or the people who criticize are right when the=\r\ny say that yours is a full of stories which are only mythological and you p=\r\nray those imaginary Gods which are nothing but characters of Stories of som=\r\ne writer.\n\n          I could not answer the question as i was not sure.\n\n  =\r\n        Spiritually yours,\n\n          Utpal\n\n          --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Hence a very important question to answer..\n       =\r\n   &gt; \n          &gt; To answer it, I will go back to the analogy I gave just a=\r\n few days back:\n          &gt; \n          &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom/message/ 1673 (Why rituals)\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *\n    =\r\n      &gt; \n          &gt; The child is taught by parents to say things like &quot;tha=\r\nnk you&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in different situations. I compared it to engaging in r=\r\nituals and repeating mantras without understanding. I said that the child s=\r\nlowly understands the true meaning with experience and feels the emotions r=\r\nepresented by those words when saying them. I compared it to a sadhaka expe=\r\nriencing spiritual truths represented by the rituals as he gains experience=\r\n and becomes more ready.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Now, think about this. Pa=\r\nrents speaking different languages teach different words to the child. A pa=\r\nrent speaking English may teach &quot;I am sorry&quot;. A parent speaking Hindi may t=\r\neach &quot;mujhe maaf keejiye&quot;. Another Hindi speaking person may teach &quot;mujhe m=\r\naaf karo&quot;. A parent speaking Telugu may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchandi&quot; . Anoth=\r\ner Telugu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchu&quot;. And so on. The word=\r\ns are different. But they represent the same thought and emotion.\n         =\r\n &gt; \n          &gt; Actually, at one level, the meaning is slightly different i=\r\nn each case, depending on the peculiarities and cultural context of the lan=\r\nguage used. For example, the English expression has &quot;I&quot; as the subject and =\r\none is talking about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have t=\r\nhe other person as the subject and asking him to forgive. The amount of res=\r\npect shown is different in different expressions. Thus, the exact meaning i=\r\ns slightly different. Thus, children speaking different languages may visua=\r\nlize something slightly different as their understanding of the languages i=\r\nmproves. However, these differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the ba=\r\nsic emotions associated with these different expressions is the same in dif=\r\nferent languages and one will feel those emotions with compassion as one ma=\r\nsters the language.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Similarly, deities, rituals an=\r\nd mantras used in different religious traditions may be different, but they=\r\n may represent the same divine energy and the same spiritual experiences. J=\r\nust as the immeidate visualization of an expression in the mind of a child =\r\nmay change based on cultural context and grammar that one is exposed to, th=\r\ne immeidate imagination of a deity&#39;s gross/external form in the mind of a s=\r\nadhaka may change based on the religious paradigms and spirutal context tha=\r\nt one is exposed to. However, these differences are minor. As one delves de=\r\neper, the basic energies and experiences represented by various deities and=\r\n rituals are the same in different religious traditions and one will experi=\r\nence the same spiritual truths as one masters one&#39;s path.\n          &gt; \n    =\r\n      &gt; No wonder Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot; (Truth is=\r\n One, but the learned say it differently) .\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *\n=\r\n          &gt; \n          &gt; One language may have a lot of different words for=\r\n an object with slight variation whereas another language may have fewer wo=\r\nrds. As an example, a language spoken near equator may have a single word f=\r\nor &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, whereas English has so many words. Nat=\r\nive language of Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has ma=\r\nny more words than English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas En=\r\nglish calls all of them as &quot;snow&quot;.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Similarly, reli=\r\ngious traditions that explored slightly different kinds of the same divine =\r\nenergy may have personified those energies as different deities. So some re=\r\nligions may have more deities than some other religions. Some religions may=\r\n have a lot of deities for different variations of a similar purpose, where=\r\nas another religion may have only one deity.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *=\r\n\n          &gt; \n          &gt; If communication can be internalized and we can c=\r\nommunicate with our emotions, we do not need language and we will all be on=\r\n the same page always. But we cannot communicate with our internal emotions=\r\n and need an external method. So language is needed. But language can divid=\r\ne.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Similarly, spiritual truths are internal (like =\r\nour emotions). In order to express them and transmit them to others, we nee=\r\nd deities, mantras, rituals and religion. But religion can divide.\n        =\r\n  &gt; \n          &gt; One child may say &quot;I am sorry&quot; and another may say another=\r\n expression meaning the same thing and they may argue who is right. One may=\r\n say &quot;my father said this is correct&quot; and another may say &quot;my mother said t=\r\nhis is correct&quot; and they may fight on who is correct. People fighting over =\r\nwhose religion is superior and trying to &quot;convert&quot; others are like such chi=\r\nldren. Unfortunately, my &quot;child and language&quot; analogy is too mild in this a=\r\nrea and the fights between religions have been far worse than two children =\r\narguing about their language. Countless people have been murdered in the na=\r\nme of religion.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Instead of arguing which expressio=\r\nn is correct and finding fault with others, children learning should focus =\r\non the true meaning of what they saying and try to understand what exactly =\r\ntheir expression means and feel the correct emotions when they say things. =\r\nSimilarly, instead of fighting with others on religion, one should try to u=\r\nnderstand one&#39;s own religion better and experience the spiritual truths rep=\r\nresented in that religion.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *\n          &gt; \n    =\r\n      &gt; One may think there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu god=\r\n etc and they are responsible for respective religions and societies. That =\r\nis not true.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; If one believes that there is a supre=\r\nme deity (whatever the name you use to describe) who creates all beings, th=\r\nen one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, Christ, Propher Mohammed and Maha=\r\nvira were sent to this earth by that same supreme deity and different relig=\r\nions came into being only because that supreme deity willed so! Each religi=\r\non serves a useful purpose at a given place and a time. When a religion&#39;s t=\r\nime is up, it goes.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *\n          &gt; \n          &gt;=\r\n Some may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspect=\r\ns of divine energy running the universe are a creation of the mind. However=\r\n, they are not a creation of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulate=\r\nd many layers of conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have eve=\r\nr seen or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life=\r\n, but may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulate=\r\nd through many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following mess=\r\nage:\n          &gt; \n          &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom=\r\n/message/ 761\n          &gt; \n          &gt; He had not read about some of the av=\r\nataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and could describe =\r\nthem. This is because those forms represent a personification of a certain =\r\nenergy and his mind imagined that energy in that form in a previous life. T=\r\nhe memory stayed with the mind (though not consciously) and it can come bac=\r\nk anytime. So, though he did not know about that form, that form appeared b=\r\nefore him.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraph=\r\nrased) , &quot;a human being imagines god as a super human being with many hands=\r\n and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffal=\r\no with many horns&quot;. Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. It=\r\n may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a wor=\r\nk of the mind, that does not make them unimportant.\n          &gt; \n          =\r\n&gt; Until one learns how to feel sorry and show that feeling, saying &quot;I am so=\r\nrry&quot; as a ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a child words because =\r\nhe cannot anyway understand their correct meaning is wrong. The child shoul=\r\nd be taught even if he does not understand. He will understand the true mea=\r\nning later Similarly, though the energy represented by a form is more basic=\r\n than a specific external form associated with that energy, many people wil=\r\nl reach that energy only by imagining that form and worshipping that form. =\r\nSo, if one&#39;s mind tends to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and =\r\nworship that form.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Though we say that forms of dei=\r\nties and mystical experiences are a creation of mind, that is in a vedantic=\r\n sense, i.e. the entire manifested universe is a creation of the mind (over=\r\n many lives). Only Brahman is real and not created by the mind. Everything =\r\nelse is a creation of the mind over the time. If we say that a form of a de=\r\nity or an experience is an imagination of the mind, it does not mean it is =\r\na hallucination. Mind is connected to its field of experience. Various mind=\r\ns in its field of experience are connected to it. For example, the experien=\r\nce described in the following message was independently &quot;observed&quot; by two p=\r\neople. Human mind can imagine things and hallucinate, but two minds observi=\r\nng the same thing is different from a typical hallucination:\n          &gt; \n =\r\n         &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n     =\r\n     &gt; \n          &gt; Most divine forms and divine experiences chronicled in =\r\nsacred texts of various religions have been independently experienced by mu=\r\nltiple people.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *\n          &gt; \n          &gt; When=\r\n someone looks sad, one person may say &quot;he is sad&quot;. Another person may say =\r\n&quot;woh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person may say &quot;vaadu baadha padutunnaadu&quot; . Simil=\r\narly, when a divine energy is present in a place, one may perceive the ener=\r\ngy as deity X and another may perceive it as a deity Y. Just as the express=\r\nion one uses to describe the feeling one perceives is based on the language=\r\n one knows, similarly the form mentioned by one to describe the enegy one p=\r\nerceives depends on the conditioning of one&#39;s mind and the religious tradit=\r\nion one is exposed to.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; I know one person who does =\r\nChandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the Divine Mother i=\r\nnto his heart by showing the fire with his hands and motioning the hands to=\r\nwards his heart (with eyes closed). When he does it, he just perceives a ni=\r\nce energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he was doing this o=\r\nneday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behind him. His eyes were=\r\n closed and he was meditating. When the above happened, he was baffled and =\r\nopened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision of a dark goddess=\r\n who was jumping towards him along with a big pile of kumkum (vermillion po=\r\nwder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and opened his eyes.=\r\n But the person who did homam perceived only some nice energy and no specif=\r\nic form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by different people in a di=\r\nfferent form. One person may perceive only some energy and another may perc=\r\neive a specific form. Yet another may perceive a different form. The exact =\r\nperception is based on the conditioning of the mind. But the energy itself =\r\nis uniform, though the form is not.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; * * *\n        =\r\n  &gt; \n          &gt; I have covered various aspects related to this topic.

One person=\r\n who \ndoes Chandi homam everyday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homa=\r\nm on a Sri \nRama Navami morning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night,=\r\n he made some \npreparations for the next day&#39;s homam (like he would do ever=\r\ny night) and laid \nout some dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of =\r\nprevious day&#39;s burnt \nashes,&nbsp;for starting fire on the next morning. He=\r\n then went to sleep. In the \nmiddle of the night, he woke up. He became awa=\r\nre of his body lying on the bed. \nHe then became aware of the homa kundam w=\r\nhich was a few feet away on another \nfloor. It felt like his body and homa =\r\nkundam were linked. Then it felt like \nsuddenly there was fire in homa kund=\r\nam and, at the same time, his energy rose. \nAs soon as that happened, he lo=\r\nst &lt;EM&gt;regular &lt;/EM&gt;awareness of his body. He no \nlonger felt his body or h=\r\noma kundam or energy in the body. He first felt like he \nlied with head dow=\r\nn and legs up and then he became absolutely weightless. Then \nhe felt like =\r\nhe was a small point, a small particle. It felt like Lord Hanuman \npulled h=\r\nim up and he went very fast into a region filled with bright light. He \nwas=\r\n a weightless particle floating in that light along with Lord Hanuman and \n=\r\nnobody else. He, the small particle,&nbsp;started praying to Lord Hanuman a=\r\nnd \nremained in a blissful state for a while.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Sudd=\r\nenly, from somewhere, a thought came about his \nbody being in a bedroom and=\r\n fire in homa kundam. He wondered, &quot;was there fire in \nhoma kundam really?&quot;=\r\n This disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness \n(i.e. being aware=\r\n of self as a body) returned.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The interesting thing=\r\n is this. When he went to his \nhoma kundam to do homam next morning, he saw=\r\n that the dried coconut pieces \nplaced there on the ashes&nbsp;previous nig=\r\nht were burnt and completely black. \nIt means there &lt;EM&gt;was&lt;/EM&gt; indeed a f=\r\nire in the homa kundam. He used the same \nprocedure everyday and placed coc=\r\nonut pieces on the ashes for the next day&#39;s \nhomam before sleeping, but suc=\r\nh a thing never happened. Basically, there must \nhave been some ember left =\r\nstill from the previous morning, though he did not see \nany ember in the ni=\r\nght and thought the fire went out completely. For some \nreason, that unseen=\r\n ember started up a small fire in the night and the coconut \npieces caught =\r\nfire. Though there is no way to know when that happened, it is \nconsistent =\r\nwith what he felt during the mystical experience! After daily homam \nfor a =\r\nlong time, a relationship formed between him and the homa kundam. \nMoreover=\r\n, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to his internal \nfir=\r\ne and developments related to it still affected his internal fire and \ncons=\r\nciousness!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When you do homam for a long time with t=\r\nhe mental \nvisualization linking that external fire to your internal fire, =\r\nthe relationship \n&lt;EM&gt;is&lt;/EM&gt; formed over the time! What happens in that ex=\r\nternal fire does then \naffect your consciousness. Even if the fire goes and=\r\n ember is left buried under \nthe ash, that ember is still linked to your in=\r\nternal fire!!

One can \nexperience god as an all-pervading light or sound and=\r\n experience oneself as a \nsmall part of that light or sound.

This was made this way \n=\r\n        for the oridinary people to understand and not leave the folds of \n=\r\n        Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism. That is why not only these =\r\n\n        stories were &quot;made&quot; which were based on deeper spiritual symbolism=\r\n \n        generated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and ma=\r\nde \n        easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskri=\r\nt of the \n        puranic age.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;The reason Buddism could become such =\r\na threat to Hinduism was \n        because the people (priests)&nbsp;had red=\r\nucded the Vedas to a book of \n        mere rituals. The Vedas are both inte=\r\nrnal and external, but the priests \n        took over the religion from the=\r\n sages/mystics and \n        reduced/neglected/forgot the internal and&nbsp;=\r\nrelied solely on the \n        external. That is why Buddha rejected the Ved=\r\nas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was=\r\n a wrong step \n        in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automa=\r\ntic choice after \n        Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake=\r\n of Buddha. However, \n        the coming of Buddha was in a reverse way, ne=\r\neded to hasten the overall \n        spiritual evolution of this world by in=\r\ncreasing the distance between God \n        and man. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;So essentially, t=\r\nhe Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood \n        movies as compar=\r\ned to the Vedas which were the Art films.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;My personal take on this: As=\r\n far as they are able to induce \n        spirituality in an very average or=\r\ndinary person from a village they are \n        excellent. But at the same t=\r\nime, if a Hindu who is not aware of the \n        comprehensive nature of hi=\r\ns own scriptures, a poor, uneducated \n        man,&nbsp;is told that his id=\r\nols are mere stones and his stories are \n        cock and bull whereas God =\r\nmust be necessarily much beyond all this, the \n        idea of a single God=\r\n, would be enough reason to make him switch \n        religions. It would so=\r\nund very logical to him.

Anoth=\r\ner \n          Telugu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchu&quot;. And so o=\r\nn. The \n          words are different. But they represent the same thought =\r\nand \n          emotion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actually, at one level, the meanin=\r\ng is \n          slightly different in each case, depending on the peculiari=\r\nties and \n          cultural context of the language used. For example, the=\r\n English \n          expression has &quot;I&quot; as the subject and one is talking ab=\r\nout how one \n          feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have the oth=\r\ner person as the \n          subject and asking him to forgive. The amount o=\r\nf respect shown is \n          different in different expressions. Thus, the=\r\n exact meaning is \n          slightly different. Thus, children speaking di=\r\nfferent languages may \n          visualize something slightly different as =\r\ntheir understanding of the \n          languages improves. However, these di=\r\nfferences are minor. As one \n          delves deeper, the basic emotions as=\r\nsociated with these different \n          expressions is the same in differe=\r\nnt languages and one will feel those \n          emotions with compassion as=\r\n one masters the language.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Similarly, deities, =\r\nrituals and mantras used in different religious \n          traditions may b=\r\ne different, but they may represent the same divine \n          energy and t=\r\nhe same spiritual experiences. Just as the immeidate \n          visualizati=\r\non of an expression in the mind of a child may change based \n          on c=\r\nultural context and grammar that one is exposed to, the immeidate \n        =\r\n  imagination of a deity&#39;s gross/external form in the mind of a sadhaka \n  =\r\n        may change based on the religious paradigms and spirutal context th=\r\nat \n          one is exposed to. However, these differences are minor. As o=\r\nne delves \n          deeper, the basic energies and experiences represented=\r\n by various \n          deities and rituals are the same in different religi=\r\nous traditions and \n          one will experience the same spiritual truths=\r\n as one masters one&#39;s \n          path.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No wonder Rigveda s=\r\nays &quot;ekam sat vipraa \n          bahudhaa vadanti&quot; (Truth is One, but the le=\r\narned say it differently) \n          .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; One language may have a lot \n          of different words for an object=\r\n with slight variation whereas another \n          language may have fewer w=\r\nords. As an example, a language spoken near \n          equator may have a s=\r\ningle word for &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, \n          whereas English=\r\n has so many words. Native language of Alaskans, who \n          live in sno=\r\nw and ice most of the year, has many more words than \n          English for=\r\n slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls \n          all of =\r\nthem as &quot;snow&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, religious \n          traditions=\r\n that explored slightly different kinds of the same divine \n          energ=\r\ny may have personified those energies as different deities. So \n          s=\r\nome religions may have more deities than some other religions. Some \n      =\r\n    religions may have a lot of deities for different variations of a \n    =\r\n      similar purpose, whereas another religion may have only one \n        =\r\n  deity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If communication can be \n =\r\n         internalized and we can communicate with our emotions, we do not n=\r\need \n          language and we will all be on the same page always. But we =\r\ncannot \n          communicate with our internal emotions and need an extern=\r\nal method. So \n          language is needed. But language can divide.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Similarly, spiritual truths are internal (like our e=\r\nmotions). In order \n          to express them and transmit them to others, =\r\nwe need deities, mantras, \n          rituals and religion. But religion can=\r\n divide.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One \n          child may say &quot;I am sorry&quot; and ano=\r\nther may say another expression \n          meaning the same thing and they =\r\nmay argue who is right. One may say \n          &quot;my father said this is corr=\r\nect&quot; and another may say &quot;my mother said \n          this is correct&quot; and th=\r\ney may fight on who is correct. People fighting \n          over whose relig=\r\nion is superior and trying to &quot;convert&quot; others are \n          like such chi=\r\nldren. Unfortunately, my &quot;child and language&quot; analogy is \n          too mil=\r\nd in this area and the fights between religions have been far \n          wo=\r\nrse than two children arguing about their language. Countless people \n     =\r\n     have been murdered in the name of religion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Instead \n=\r\n          of arguing which expression is correct and finding fault with oth=\r\ners, \n          children learning should focus on the true meaning of what =\r\nthey saying \n          and try to understand what exactly their expression =\r\nmeans and feel the \n          correct emotions when they say things. Simila=\r\nrly, instead of fighting \n          with others on religion, one should try=\r\n to understand one&#39;s own \n          religion better and experience the spir=\r\nitual truths represented in \n          that religion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One may think \n          there is a Christian god, an Is=\r\nlamic god, a Hindu god etc and they are \n          responsible for respecti=\r\nve religions and societies. That is not \n          true.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I=\r\nf one believes that there is a supreme deity \n          (whatever the name =\r\nyou use to describe) who creates all beings, then \n          one has to rea=\r\nlize that Vyasa, Buddha, Christ, Propher Mohammed and \n          Mahavira w=\r\nere sent to this earth by that same supreme deity and \n          different =\r\nreligions came into being only because that supreme deity \n          willed=\r\n so! Each religion serves a useful purpose at a given place and \n          =\r\na time. When a religion&#39;s time is up, it goes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * \n      =\r\n    *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some may say that external forms of deities who \n   =\r\n       personify different aspects of divine energy running the universe ar=\r\ne \n          a creation of the mind. However, they are not a creation of th=\r\ne \n          current state of mind. Mind has accumulated many layers of \n  =\r\n        conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever seen or=\r\n \n          thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this li=\r\nfe, but \n          may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioni=\r\nng accumulated \n          through many lives. An example is the boy mention=\r\ned in the following \n          message:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A \n          href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761&quot; \n          targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n        =\r\n  wisdom/message/ 761&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He had not read about some of \n =\r\n         the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and =\r\n\n          could describe them. This is because those forms represent a \n  =\r\n        personification of a certain energy and his mind imagined that ener=\r\ngy \n          in that form in a previous life. The memory stayed with the m=\r\nind \n          (though not consciously) and it can come back anytime. So, t=\r\nhough he \n          did not know about that form, that form appeared before=\r\n him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraphra=\r\nsed) , &quot;a human \n          being imagines god as a super human being with m=\r\nany hands and heads. \n          If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine g=\r\nod as a super buffalo with \n          many horns&quot;. Though he is right in a =\r\nsense, it is misleading too. It \n          may incorrectly trivialize exter=\r\nnal forms. Though external forms are a \n          work of the mind, that do=\r\nes not make them unimportant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Until one learns =\r\nhow to feel sorry and show that feeling, \n          saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; as =\r\na ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a \n          child words becau=\r\nse he cannot anyway understand their correct meaning \n          is wrong. T=\r\nhe child should be taught even if he does not understand. \n          He wil=\r\nl understand the true meaning later Similarly, though the energy \n         =\r\n represented by a form is more basic than a specific external form \n       =\r\n   associated with that \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
