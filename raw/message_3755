He has taken three =E2=80=93\nmy =\r\nbody, my mind and life itself =E2=80=93 and given in return one only, that =\r\nOne,\nIndivisible Supreme!=E2=80=9D\n\nIn 1932, M.A. Piggot was the first West=\r\nern woman to visit him. More\nWesterners followed, such as Maurice Frydman a=\r\nnd the famous film star\nMercedes De Acosta. In 1938 Mercedes De Acosta spok=\r\ne with Sri Ramana about\nthe spiritual Heart. He pointed to the right side o=\r\nf her chest and said,\n=E2=80=9CHere lies the Heart=E2=80=9D. This made such=\r\n a deep impression on her that she gave\nher autobiography the title =E2=80=\r\n=98Here lies the Heart=E2=80=99.\n\nParamahansa Yogananda and Swami Ramdas we=\r\nre also among the visitors. A\nmeeting with Mahatma Gandhi almost took place=\r\n, when one day Gandhi gave a\ntalk in Tiruvannamalai. But as his car drove p=\r\nast the Ashram gate, his\ncompanion gave a sign to the driver to drive on an=\r\nd so it did not happen.\nLater Krishnaswami visited Mahatma Gandhi in Madras=\r\n. When he introduced\nhimself as a resident of Ramanashram, the Mahatma repl=\r\nied, =E2=80=9CI would love to\ncome and see Bhagavan but I don=E2=80=99t kno=\r\nw when the time will come.=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen a devotee brought a nice walking =\r\nstick with a silver handle for Sri\nRamana he said jokingly, =E2=80=9CGood. =\r\nIt is very nice. Please use it carefully.=E2=80=9D\nThe disciple replied, =\r\n=E2=80=9CBut it is not for my use. I have brought it thinking\nthat Bhagavan=\r\n would use it.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhat an idea!=E2=80=9D, said Ramana. =E2=\r\n=80=9CA nice walking\nstick with a silver handle should be used only by offi=\r\ncials like you. Why\nfor me? Look, I have my own walking stick. That is enou=\r\ngh.=E2=80=9D\n\nAt the beginning of the forties a devotee brought an electric=\r\n table fan for\nRamana. The answer was as usual, =E2=80=9CWhy this fan? The =\r\nordinary fan is there.\nWe have hands. I will fan myself with it whenever ne=\r\ncessary. Why do I\nrequire all these things?=E2=80=9D But the devotee would =\r\nnot leave it at that and\nargued, =E2=80=9CIs it not some trouble? If the el=\r\nectric fan is used there is no\ntrouble whatsoever.=E2=80=9D But Ramana repl=\r\nied, =E2=80=9CWhat is the trouble? If the\nordinary fan is used we get just =\r\nas much breeze as we want. The electric fan\nblows too much breeze and with =\r\na whizzing noise. Moreover, some electric\ncurrent is consumed. For that, th=\r\nere will be a bill. Why should we make the\noffice bear that expense on our =\r\naccount?=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Ramana repeatedly complained about the many things w=\r\nhich were offered to\nhim and which he did not actually need, =E2=80=9CI am =\r\na poor man. For my status,\neven what I now have is too much. This sofa, the=\r\nse mattresses, these pillows\n=E2=80=93 why all these? You people\ndo not agr=\r\nee, but how happy would it be if I could spread out this towel and\nsit on t=\r\nhe floor!=E2=80=9D Mudaliar replied, =E2=80=9CYou say even that towel shoul=\r\nd be no\nbigger than the present one!=E2=80=9D Ramana replied,=E2=80=9D Why =\r\na bigger one? It is\nhalf-a-yard broad and three-quarters of a yard long. It=\r\n is sufficient for\ndrying the body after bath, for spreading over the head =\r\nif you walk in the\nsun, for tying round the neck if it is cold and for spre=\r\nading on the floor\nto sit on. What more could we do with a bigger one?=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n\nAll his life Sri Ramana resisted being venerated as a Guru. The dis=\r\nciple\nshows his veneration, for example, by touching the feet of the master=\r\n.\nHowever this was strictly forbidden at Ramanashram.\n\nWhen Roda McIver fel=\r\nt a deep longing to touch Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s feet,he answered,\n=E2=80=9CW=\r\nhy do you want to touch these feet? Bhagavan=E2=80=99s feet are over your h=\r\nead.=E2=80=9D And\nto another devotee who expressed the desire, to lay his h=\r\nead on his feet, he\nput the question, =E2=80=9CWhich is the foot and which =\r\nis the head?=E2=80=9D The devotee\nknew not what to answer. After a while Ma=\r\nharshi said, =E2=80=9CWhere the self\nmerges, that is the foot. It is in one=\r\n=E2=80=99s own self. The feeling =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, t=\r\nhe\nego, is the head. Where that ego dissolves, that is the foot of the Guru=\r\n.=E2=80=9D\n\nProstration (namaskaram) is also widely used as an expression o=\r\nf veneration\nfor Guru and God. With hands folded above the head the devotee=\r\n throws\nhimself flat on the ground, face downwards.When devotees entered th=\r\ne Hall,\nthey used to do namaskaram to Sri Ramana and occasionally they also=\r\n overdid\nit. But the Maharshi repeatedly stressed that the real namaskaram =\r\nis in the\nheart. When a man prostrated innumerable times to him, he said, =\r\n=E2=80=9CWhere is\nthe need for all these gymnastics? It is better to show y=\r\nour devotion by\nkeeping quiet!=E2=80=9D\n\nLikewise the water with which he w=\r\nashed his hands after meals was sought\nafter. Not even his bath water was s=\r\nafe from devotees.It is again Suri\nNagamma who reports the following fantas=\r\ntic incident,=E2=80=9CIn the room where\nBhagavan takes his bath, there is a=\r\n hole through which the water that is\nused drains out. Below that, a gutter=\r\n was constructed to drain off the\nwater. At the time of his bathing,some de=\r\nvotees used to gather at that\nplace, sprinkle on their heads the water that=\r\n came out of the room, wipe\ntheir eyes and even use it for achamaniyam (sip=\r\nping drops of water for\nreligious\npurpose). That was going on quietly and u=\r\nnobserved for some time. But in due\ncourse people began bringing vessels an=\r\nd buckets to gather that water and\nsoon there was a regular queue. That nat=\r\nurally resulted in some noise which\nreached Bhagavan=E2=80=99s ears. He enq=\r\nuired and found out the facts. Addressing the\nattendants, he said, =E2=80=\r\n=98=E2=80=A6 What nonsense! Will you get this stopped or shall I\nbathe at t=\r\nhe tap outside? If that is done, you will be saved the trouble of\nheating w=\r\nater for me, and there will be no trouble for them either,to watch\nand wait=\r\n for that tirtha [holy water]. What do I want? Only two things, a\ntowel and=\r\n a koupina. I can bathe and then rinse them at the tap and that\ncompletes t=\r\nhe job. If not the tap, you have the hill streams and the tanks.\nWhy this b=\r\nother? What do you say?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D As a result, Chinnaswami immediat=\r\nely put\nan end to these practices.\n\nOnce a devotee from the West was cleari=\r\nng away the leaf plates in front of\nthe dining hall, which was a completely=\r\n useless occupation,as the used\nleaves were in any case meant to be thrown =\r\naway.When Ramana saw him, he\nasked him why he was doing it. The devotee ans=\r\nwered that he had not found\nany means to be of service since his arrival at=\r\n the Ashram, so he wanted to\ndo this work.But Ramana replied indignantly, =\r\n=E2=80=9CIs sweeping the used leaf\nplates the means to get salvation? Is it=\r\n to perform this tapas that you have\ncome here all the way from abroad. Go!=\r\n Go! Enough of doing this kind of\nservice! Go inside, sit to one side, turn=\r\n your mind inward and find out he\nwho wants to be saved. The service of pur=\r\nifying your heart is alone the\nhighest service. That alone can truly redeem=\r\n you.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Ramana made no distinctions between his devotees. Wheth=\r\ner they lived\nwith him, came to visit now and then or even if they never sa=\r\nw him at all in\nthe body, his grace flowed and continues to flow for all of=\r\n them. He would\nsay, =E2=80=9CTo me there is no distinction.Grace is flowin=\r\ng like the ocean ever\nfull. Every one draws from it according to his capaci=\r\nty. How can one who\nbrings only a tumbler complain that he is not able to t=\r\nake as much as\nanother who has brought a jar?=E2=80=9D\n\nSource: Ramana Maha=\r\nrshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd182a4bacad704800011c2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nThe Tamil Poet Muruganar came to Sri Ramana in 1923.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once he said ab=\r\nout Sri Ramana, =E2=80=9CHe is the robber chief.
