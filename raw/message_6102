This can be yo=\r\nur career, but, does not necessarily have to be so.  It should be something=\r\n, though, that you are actively engaged in doing and something that you fee=\r\nl deeply about.  Here are some examples:  Yoga Teacher, Professional Blogge=\r\nr, Health Care Professional, Technology Professional, Businessman, Politici=\r\nan, etc=E2=80=A6\n\nStep 2:  In this field that you care very deeply about, t=\r\nhink about someone who is enormously successful.  Successful in all ways if=\r\n possible.  Someone who has made a huge amount of money in that field, beco=\r\nme famous and is powerful.  Now one more criteria is important about this p=\r\nerson.  If possible, have it be someone who you don=E2=80=99t like, or don=\r\n=E2=80=99t agree with.  The more you dislike their ways and methods the bet=\r\nter, but the test will also work pretty well even if you don=E2=80=99t disl=\r\nike the person or their systems.\n\nStep 3:  Watch your reaction to when you =\r\nhear complimentary information about this person, or just hear about the su=\r\nccess this person is having in their life.  Be brutally honest, or you will=\r\n just be cheating yourself.  Does it create any negative wave within you?  =\r\nAny tinge of jealousy?  Any feeling of irritation?  Any feeling of frustrat=\r\nion?  Any feeling of hurt?  Does it cause any ripple, any disturbance, in y=\r\nour psyche?  The greater the disturbance the more the test indicates its ti=\r\nme to get busy with your spiritual practice.  Here is a more detailed analy=\r\nsis of the test results.\n\nA negative reaction or disturbance can indicate t=\r\nhe following with regard to your spiritual state=E2=80=A6\n\n1.  Too Much Amb=\r\nition:  You are probably focused too much on getting results and are overly=\r\n ambitious.  These attachments to the results can cause jealousy and ill-wi=\r\nll towards those who have already achieved what you so badly seek.  Another=\r\n way to look at this is you may not be doing what your really love to do in=\r\n life?  This is the only way to be free of the clutches of society and gain=\r\n oriented living.  Doing what you love to do, will free you from everything=\r\n.  If this test produced negative waves, it could mean that you are only do=\r\ning things to see what you will get out of them, instead of doing things fo=\r\nr their own sake.\n\n2. Non-Dual Perception of Reality:  The test could also =\r\nindicate that you are living excessively in an ego-centric way.  You are se=\r\neing the world as full of separate people and focusing on the various perso=\r\nnalities, instead of seeing the world in a non-dual light with all of creat=\r\nion being One and having nothing but divine nature.  As Yogi Bhajan points =\r\nout, &quot;If you don=E2=80=99t see God in all, you don=E2=80=99t see God at all=\r\n.&quot;  Are you seeing the Divine Nature of he who is getting under your skin? =\r\n Are you seeing the Oneness of Reality?\n\n3.  Chasing the Wrong Things in Li=\r\nfe:  If you have never thought about it, let me point out an interesting fa=\r\nct about enlightenment.  In society there is so much competition because re=\r\nsources/rewards are limited.  There are only so many top 10 Blogs, there is=\r\n only 1 winner in the tournaments, there are only limited political seats, =\r\nthere is only 1 CEO, only so much oil, land, etc etc.  This breeds competit=\r\nion and conflict.  But Enlightenment is not limited.  Just because I am enl=\r\nightened, does not mean you can=E2=80=99t be also.  We can all be enlighten=\r\ned (and are), so this is one of those things you can chase without worrying=\r\n about having to wrestle it away from anyone else.  There is no need to com=\r\npete, it is an infinite, inexhaustible resource.  So this test implies that=\r\n you are not exclusively chasing enlightenment.  You are getting distracted=\r\n and running around all over the place chasing useless stupid things.  Time=\r\n to buckle down and get back to the business of going after that which is t=\r\nhe highest purpose of man.  Time to fulfill your destiny.\n\nTake this test f=\r\nrom time to time, or be aware when life brings it your way.  It is an insig=\r\nhtful instrument to gauge your goodness and spiritual understanding.\n\n\n\n"}}
