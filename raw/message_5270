I also see \nego in his Senior Guru Ma=\r\nharaj for cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of \nillness for not being gi=\r\nven audience and I see ego in them in much the same way \nyou and other peop=\r\nle see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high \ncaliber. Yet peo=\r\nple burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his \nactions ident=\r\nified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon. \nRobert Svobo=\r\nda puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so we see only \npositive in=\r\n him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by some scriptures and we see \nonly=\r\n bad in him, yet he was a very powerful sadhaka than Vimalanada or his \nsen=\r\nior guru maharaja for sure. So why cannot we see Ravana&#39;s action as divine =\r\n\nplay and stop Ravana dahan on dussera? And if we see Ravana as egoisitic, =\r\nthen \nfor sure why the incidents I mention from Vimalanada&#39;s book cannot be=\r\n seen in a \nsimilar way. But htese are all great sadhak and were greatly su=\r\nccessful in \nwhatever they tried to achieve from their sadhana.\n\nI am not v=\r\nery well versed with scriptures so I find it hard to quote from them \nor re=\r\nmember all the names, but do you remember a rishi from the Mahabharata who =\r\n\nwas pleaded to Duryodhana to pay a visit pandavas in the forest. This rish=\r\ni was \nvery pleased by the hospitality shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi =\r\nwas well \nknown for his temper and often feared by people. It is exactly fo=\r\nr this reason \nwhy Duryodhana invited this rishi to his palace and provided=\r\n him with all \nhospitality so that he could convince this rishi to pay visi=\r\nt to panadavas who \nwould not be able to accomodate the rishi this lavishly=\r\n and therefore would have \nto suffer his curse.If this rishi was so tempera=\r\nmental, how was he so succesful \nin his sadhana? I read so frequently=C2=A0=\r\nabout the need to give up anger for success \nin sadhana.=C2=A0This apparent=\r\nly does not seem=C2=A0to apply to=C2=A0this rishi. He was \nsuccessful regar=\r\ndless. Vimalanada&#39;s book also mentions that this rishi was later \npunished =\r\nby Lord Visnu and had 10,000 years of his tapasya fruits taken away \nfrom h=\r\nim. If everything that these rishi&#39;s do has to be identified with their \nde=\r\nity and therefore cannot be faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?=\r\n\n\nI am not saying that I should not change my svabhau to achieve success in=\r\n \nsadhana. It is never nice to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is =\r\n\ncertainly not easy to change once nature either. we can only hope that chn=\r\nage in \nsvabhau can be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not goin=\r\ng to be \nsuccessful in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svab=\r\nhau, and if we \ndo not have the strength to change ourselves, basically bas=\r\ned on what you are \nsaying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am n=\r\not trying to start an \nargument here, but I simply do not get it. I see ego=\r\n in all the poeple of the \nstories I mentioned and all of them are about gr=\r\neat sadhaks.\n\nLastly that link to the=C2=A0post=C2=A0regarding Manish is ve=\r\nry interesting. You did not \nsend this to me before. You did make a mention=\r\n though about Vimalanada Aghora \nseries of books, and in the same message, =\r\nyou mentioned someone who was able to \nachieve specifioc results from speci=\r\nfic sadhana&#39;s by reading this book. That is \nwhat drew my attention to that=\r\n book and finally made me join this yahoo group as \na way to get in touch w=\r\nith you. It could be that your message had gone to the \nSPAM folder.You are=\r\n very fortunate to have met him and=C2=A0have his guidance.\n\nWhile I am on =\r\nthis subject of success in sadhana, I do the Super Short version \nof the ho=\r\nma on a=C2=A0weekly basis. As I read and try to learn the regular version, =\r\nI \nsee that it makes use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you i=\r\nn \nBoston, we have a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass =\r\nlet \nalone darbha during the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you gro=\r\nw them in \na pot? If so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha?=\r\n You also \nmention that one should not be looking for specific results from=\r\n once sadhana. \nBefore the commencement of the sadhana or homa, what should=\r\n one declare as the \nmotive in such a case? I have to tell you here that I =\r\ncannot lie about my \nintentions to God. And=C2=A0if I do, I will probably k=\r\neep thinking about it for the \nduration of the sadhana and the whole experi=\r\nence gioes to waste as the mind is \nnot at ease.=C2=A0=C2=A0How about when =\r\none is not clear about the specific reasons for \ndoing homa or sadhana but =\r\nyou were doing it for a specific purpose but now with \npurpose met, you are=\r\n directionless but realise the significance of sadhana or \nhoma, feel good =\r\ndoing it=C2=A0and do not want to give up? Is it important to declare \na mot=\r\nive before commencing sadhana?\n\nThanks,\nBhupendra.\n\n\n\n\n____________________=\r\n____________\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\nCc: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\nSent: Thu, Novemb=\r\ner 18, 2010 2:52:06 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Ego (Re: Success with=\r\n Mantras)\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste Sir,\n\nLet me add my 2 cents of perspective on yo=\r\nur nice observations.\n\n&gt; The examples I give above does not illustrate a pi=\r\ncture of people who were\n&gt; compassionate and always willing to forgive and =\r\nforget.\n\nForgiving and forgetting is not necessarily saattwik, when it is t=\r\nhe work of a \ndense ego. For example, one may do it to look good or impress=\r\n others. Similarly, \nhurting someone is not necessarily taamasik/raajasik, =\r\nwhen it is a result of a \nlight ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting V=\r\nishnu in the chest with his \nfoot was a divine drama for a higher purpose.\n=\r\n\nCopying the actions of divine beings requires some intelligence. To borrow=\r\n an \nidiom from my mother tongue, a fox does not become a tiger if it paint=\r\ns stripes \non its body.\n\nPeople you are talking about are very high level b=\r\neings. Those who efface their \nego and start to self-identify with some hig=\r\nher deities will start to exhibit \nthe nature of those deities. Their actio=\r\nns may be fierce at times, but their \npurpose will be divine.\n\nWhether one =\r\nwants liberation or one wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga \n(oneness) of=\r\n a deity or whatever one wants, the first step is to efface ego. All \nsadha=\r\nnas are meant for that only. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or \nso=\r\nmeone else achieved, the starting point is to efface your ego through sadha=\r\nna. \nAs you make progress, at some stage, you may start seeing some results=\r\n.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Nobody here I\n&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating =\r\na few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is r=\r\nequired such that our sadhana\n&gt; produces results that are easily noticeable=\r\n to us.\n\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if on=\r\ne is thinking \nof it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a century t=\r\noday&quot; is unlikely to \nscore a century. The best strategy is to take it a ba=\r\nll at a time and focus. \nSimilarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop thi=\r\nnking about results and just \nfocusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.\n\nMoreover, li=\r\nberation is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he \nwould=\r\n come back a century later and that people would be liberated en masse in \n=\r\nthat birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.\n\n* * *\n\nBh=\r\nupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Manish \ncons=\r\niders himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar nature. I am=\r\n \nprivately aware of some incidents similar to what you described below wit=\r\nh \nVimalananda. However, the essence of Manish&#39;s mesage is to do sadhana an=\r\nd efface \nego, i.e. what I wrote above.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom/message/3481\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Less=\r\nons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n---- Bh=\r\nupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Atul Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Vimala=\r\nnanda certainly seems like a cool person when we read about him but to \n&gt;sa=\r\ny\n&gt; that sometimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not l=\r\nearn \n&gt;well\n&gt; is an understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book=\r\n when he goes to \na\n&gt; cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else th=\r\nere? After a brief\n&gt; argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0h=\r\ne dies! Similarly when Robert\n&gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda dur=\r\ning a TV interview, Vimalananda \ngoes\n&gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to exp=\r\nlain his reasons for not acknowledging him.\n&gt; Vimalanada did not like to dr=\r\naw attention to himself and secondly he was\n&gt; sick,=C2=A0and that was the r=\r\neason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had\n&gt; received from Vimala=\r\nnanda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but\n&gt; Vimalananda could not b=\r\ne pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the\n&gt; time the interview=\r\n was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking\n&gt; acknowledgement even =\r\nwhen he claims he does not like public attention! \nProbably\n&gt; transmission =\r\nbreaking down was again part of divine will you think? Robert\n&gt; Sbvoboda hi=\r\nmself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda\n&gt; was i=\r\nmpossible especially when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to \n&gt;h=\r\nis\n&gt; mistake.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has w=\r\nas denied audience by \n&gt;a\n&gt; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insul=\r\nted by this, he curses this ill\n&gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and =\r\nthat sadhu finally succumbs to that \n&gt;and\n&gt; dies! Now if I like to meet som=\r\nebody and am denied audience, do I curse them \nto\n&gt; death?\n&gt;\n&gt; The examples=\r\n I give above does not illustrate a picture of people who were\n&gt; compassion=\r\nate and always willing to forgive and forget. But still, they were\n&gt; hugely=\r\n successful in their sadhana in their own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; ta=\r\nlking about here....the pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n=\r\n&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for=\r\n a\n&gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required such that our sadh=\r\nana\n&gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a fee=\r\nling \n&gt;though\n&gt; that there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows=\r\n those\n&gt; pre-requisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort=\r\n and \ncontinue\n&gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradually.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Dr.=\r\n A.

( or nadis - sorry if=\r\n i am choosing bad words) if \n&gt;those\n&gt; channels are not clean then that ene=\r\nrgy flow can create unpleasant experiences\n&gt; like increased anger, lust etc=\r\n. and opposite if channels are clean enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rishis have clean channels=\r\n and they flow along with divine will. curses and\n&gt; blessings they give are=\r\n just part of divine will. like curse given to lord\n&gt; vishnu by sage narda =\r\nwhich led to ramayana. similarly curses given to yadav\n&gt; vansh and king pri=\r\nkshit played an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy\n&gt; except few time=\r\ns when he was markedly irritated.Like in an incidence where one\n&gt; of his fe=\r\nmale disciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in front of\n&gt; him =\r\nto learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that \n&gt;=\r\nhis\n&gt; student did not learnt well what he taught to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On other sid=\r\ne people with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be \nable\n&gt; to h=\r\nandle that energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like\n&gt;=\r\n ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning.

I also see ego in his Senior Guru Maharaj for cursing the ailing sa=\r\ndhu to lifetime of illness for not being given audience and I see ego in th=\r\nem in much the same way you and other people see ego in Ravana. Ravana was =\r\na tapasvi of a very high caliber. Yet people burn his effigy on dussera. Ho=\r\nw many times do we see his actions identified with his deity? We call Ravan=\r\na fare and square a demon. Robert Svoboda puts up a very positive image of =\r\nVimalananda so we see only positive in him. Ravana is put in a very bad lig=\r\nht by some scriptures and we see only bad in him, yet he was a\n very powerf=\r\nul sadhaka than Vimalanada or his senior guru maharaja for sure. So why can=\r\nnot we see Ravana&#39;s action as divine play and stop Ravana dahan on dussera?=\r\n And if we see Ravana as egoisitic, then for sure why the incidents I menti=\r\non from Vimalanada&#39;s book cannot be seen in a similar way. But htese are al=\r\nl great sadhak and were greatly successful in whatever they tried to achiev=\r\ne from their sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am not very well verse=\r\nd with scriptures so I find it hard to quote from them or remember all the =\r\nnames, but do you remember a rishi from the Mahabharata who was pleaded to =\r\nDuryodhana to pay a visit pandavas in the forest.

I read so frequently&nbsp;about the need to give =\r\nup anger for success in sadhana.&nbsp;This apparently does not seem&nbsp;to=\r\n apply to&nbsp;this rishi. He was successful regardless. Vimalanada&#39;s book =\r\nalso mentions that this rishi was later\n punished by Lord Visnu and had 10,=\r\n000 years of his tapasya fruits taken away from him. If everything that the=\r\nse rishi&#39;s do has to be identified with their deity and therefore cannot be=\r\n faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;I am not saying that I should not change my svabhau to achieve success i=\r\nn sadhana.

As I r=\r\nead and try to learn the regular version, I see that it makes use of darbha=\r\n grass in various places. Just like you in Boston, we have a similar climat=\r\ne here in Toronto. How do you get grass let alone darbha during the 4-6 mon=\r\nths of freezing temperature? Do you grow them in a pot? If so, what variety=\r\n of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? You also mention that one should not=\r\n be looking for specific results from once sadhana. Before the commencement=\r\n of the sadhana or homa, what should one declare as the motive in such a ca=\r\nse? I have to tell you here that I cannot lie about my intentions to God. A=\r\nnd&nbsp;if I do, I will probably keep thinking about it for the duration of=\r\n the sadhana and the whole experience gioes to waste as the mind is not at =\r\nease.&nbsp;&nbsp;How about when one is not clear about the specific reasons=\r\n for doing homa\n or sadhana but you were doing it for a specific purpose bu=\r\nt now with purpose met, you are directionless but realise the significance =\r\nof sadhana or homa, feel good doing it&nbsp;and do not want to give up? Is =\r\nit important to declare a motive before commencing sadhana?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bhupendra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FA=\r\nMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; MARGIN: 5px 0px 5px 5px; PADDING-LE=\r\nFT: 5px; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 1=\r\n2pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEI=\r\nGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Cc:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Bhupendra Jamnad=\r\nas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent=\r\n:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thu, November 18, 2010 2:52:06 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WE=\r\nIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Ego (Re: Success with=\r\n Mantras)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV i=\r\nd=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste Sir,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me add my 2 cents of perspective =\r\non your nice observations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The examples I give above does not i=\r\nllustrate a picture of people who were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; compassionate and always wil=\r\nling to forgive and forget.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forgiving and forgetting is not necessar=\r\nily saattwik, when it is the work of a dense ego. For example, one may do i=\r\nt to look good or impress others. Similarly, hurting someone is not necessa=\r\nrily taamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a light ego. For example, Ma=\r\nharshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his foot was a divine drama =\r\nfor a higher purpose.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Copying the actions of divine beings requires =\r\nsome intelligence. To borrow an idiom from my mother tongue, a fox does not=\r\n become a tiger if it paints stripes on its body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People you are tal=\r\nking about are very high level beings. Those who efface their ego and start=\r\n to self-identify with some higher deities will start to exhibit the nature=\r\n of\n those deities. Their actions may be fierce at times, but their purpose=\r\n will be divine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whether one wants liberation or one wants saayujya =\r\n(togetherness) or yoga (oneness) of a deity or whatever one wants, the firs=\r\nt step is to efface ego. All sadhanas are meant for that only. If you want =\r\nto achieve what Vimalananda or someone else achieved, the starting point is=\r\n to efface your ego through sadhana. As you make progress, at some stage, y=\r\nou may start seeing some results.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nobody here I&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary=\r\n for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required such tha=\r\nt our sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if one is=\r\n thinking of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a century today&quot;=\r\n is unlikely to score a century. The best strategy is to take it a ball\n at=\r\n a time and focus. Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop thinking =\r\nabout results and just focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Moreover, lib=\r\neration is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he would c=\r\nome back a century later and that people would be liberated en masse in tha=\r\nt birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Man=\r\nish considers himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar natu=\r\nre. I am privately aware of some incidents similar to what you described be=\r\nlow with Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish&#39;s mesage is to do sadh=\r\nana and efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best\n r=\r\negards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish te=\r\nxtbook,&lt;BR&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a differen=\r\nce: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:b_jamnadas%40yahoo.ca&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:b_jamnadas%40yahoo.ca&quot;&gt;b_jamnadas@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste=\r\n Atul Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalananda certainly seems like a cool person wh=\r\nen we read about him but to say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that sometimes he was irritated whe=\r\nn he felt that his student did not learn well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is an understatement.=\r\n Do you recall an instance from his book when he goes to a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cave to =\r\nperform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? After a brief&lt;BR&gt;&gt; arg=\r\nument, when the other sadhu would not budge,&nbsp;he dies! Similarly when R=\r\nobert&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV interview=\r\n, Vimalananda goes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his reas=\r\nons for not acknowledging him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw atte=\r\nntion to himself and secondly he was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sick,&nbsp;and that was the re=\r\nason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; received from V=\r\nimalananda - to avoid people crowding at his door,\n but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalananda=\r\n could not be pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ntime the interview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; acknowledgement even when he claims he does not like public attention! P=\r\nrobably&lt;BR&gt;&gt; transmission breaking down was again part of divine will yo=\r\nu think? Robert&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sbvoboda himself mentions in the opening chapter th=\r\nat dealing with Vimalananda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was impossible especially when one know=\r\ns he is wrong but will never admit to his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mistake.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nThen there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience=\r\n by a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, h=\r\ne curses this ill&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sad=\r\nhu finally succumbs to that and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dies! Now if I like to meet somebod=\r\ny and am denied audience, do I curse them to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; death?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The examples I give above does not\n illustrate a picture of people who wer=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; compassionate and always willing to forgive and forget. But still=\r\n, they were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hugely successful in their sadhana in their own way. An=\r\nd that is what we are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; talking about here....the pre-requisite to su=\r\nccess in sadhana. Nobody here I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberatio=\r\nn repeating a few rounds of rosary for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; particular mantra....but c=\r\nertianly what is required such that our sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; produces results th=\r\nat are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling though&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that =\r\nthere is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pre-re=\r\nquisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and continue&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; without to let things unfold themselves&nbsp;gradually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhupendra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ____________=\r\n____________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis - so=\r\nrry if i am choosing bad words) if those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; channels are not clean the=\r\nn that energy flow can create\n unpleasant experiences&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like increase=\r\nd anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Rishis have clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses =\r\nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessings they give are just part of divine will. like curse gi=\r\nven to lord&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly c=\r\nurses given to yadav&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vansh and king prikshit played an important ro=\r\nle. vimlananda was a cool guy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; except few times when he was markedly=\r\n irritated.Like in an incidence where one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of his female disciple tr=\r\nied to illude him by coming almost naked in front of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him to learn h=\r\now to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nstudent did not learnt well what he taught to her.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nOn other side people with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be =\r\nable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger=\r\n lust etc. like&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning.
