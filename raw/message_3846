I have been doing the Ganapathi Homam for the past half a=\r\n year or so and I should say that I am not maintaining the Brahmacharya as =\r\n&quot;defined&quot; in the mail exchanges and some books. I feel that the problem wit=\r\nh Sex with most of us is that we tend to identify it with something wrong o=\r\nr something which is &quot;impure&quot; and hence forbidden. I have been performing s=\r\nome experiments in my daily life and I have found that it is defintitely po=\r\nssible to avoid the feelings of Lust, Greed and other feelings even while h=\r\naving sex. Although I am not perfect in this but I feel with lot of practic=\r\ne it should=C2=A0be possible to achieve a state of mind even during sex whe=\r\nre you are focussed on=C2=A0God and not wavered by the feelings that accomp=\r\nanies mundane\n sex. In this case even something as materialistic as Sex wil=\r\nl be transformed into a=C2=A0intense spiritual sadhana.=C2=A0If you start t=\r\nhinking of Sex not as sometihng Impure and start doing it as Karma itself w=\r\nith out any other accompanying thoughts and do the &quot;Act&quot; itself as an offer=\r\ning to God then I feel that Brahmacharya as defined conventionally is not n=\r\needed. I would say that we are very much observing Brahmacharya. Now coming=\r\n to Ojas I doubt that Ojas can be so physical as Semen. If the act of Sex i=\r\ns itself perfomed as an offering to God and without any thoughts other than=\r\n that of God then where is the question of loosing any spiritual energy . I=\r\nn fact you are adding to your spiritual growth. \nI have observed a change i=\r\nn myself after doing this practically over the past couple of months. I hav=\r\ne found that gradually over a period of time even though its possible to co=\r\nmpletely abstain from physical sex, it is also possible to avoid getting sw=\r\nayed by it and also not crave for it.\n=C2=A0\nContinuing further=C2=A0, how =\r\nwould one justify &quot;Nightfalls&quot; which is a natural phenomenon wherein the bo=\r\ndy automatically purges excess semen collected over a period of time when o=\r\nne is asleep without the persons control.In other words it is an involuntar=\r\ny=C2=A0action just like breathing.\n=C2=A0\nCan this also be=C2=A0intrepreted=\r\n as break in Brahmacharya? I would be keen to know the experiences of those=\r\n persons who have abstained from physical sex for an extended period of tim=\r\ne and=C2=A0what they think=C2=A0of=C2=A0&quot;Nightfalls&quot; .\n=C2=A0\n************ =\r\n********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* *****=\r\n**** ********* ********* ********* ********* ********\n=C2=A0\nI think that e=\r\nvery action that we do should be done with the thought of an offering to go=\r\nd. For example even while having food , we can think each bite as an offeri=\r\nng to Ganapathi in fire (actually there is a fire in our stomach which burn=\r\ns the food) , Our entire body can be visuilased like a living moving Homa k=\r\nundam where we continuously offer ahuti of differnet materials. If we conci=\r\nously make this effort over a period of time we would think less about the =\r\nprocess of eating=C2=A0food itself , the accompanying pleasure of taste etc=\r\n and concentrate more on mental homam which we are performing. Every though=\r\nt process can be considered as an ahuti inside the mental fire in our soul.=\r\nLike this every action that we do in our daily life can be thought as a hom=\r\nam itself and thereby achieve the state of mind where there is no distincti=\r\non between the so called &quot;Pure&quot; and &quot;Impure&quot; , &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; and so on.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nPlease let us=C2=A0know your thoughts on this.

Others answered your questions and I will leave them=\r\n. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on aghora s=\r\neems to have created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand when =\r\nwe are communicating verbally, because one&#39;s own mental conditioning has a =\r\nrole in deciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-text. It=\r\n is more so when we are talking about delicate matters.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; 3. When t=\r\nhe talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, is it really needed\n&gt; to perform &quot;Bramhach=\r\nariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam?\n\nBrahmacharya is very important in any spi=\r\nritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan said, sexual activity results in loss of=\r\n ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a part of one&#39;s creative essence. Doing =\r\nsadhana without brahmacharya is like filling a water pot that is leaking th=\r\nrough a hole. Even if you succeed in filling the pot with water, it will so=\r\non become\n empty!\n\nJust as a filled water pot that is leaking may still sat=\r\nisfy the thirst of someone who takes a glass of water from it, similarly a =\r\nperson doing sadhana without brahmacharya may sometimes be able to do his d=\r\nharma and serve his purpose in the world. So, it is a good idea to do sadha=\r\nna even as one&#39;s brahmacharya is not good yet. But, the best will be if the=\r\n filled water pot is not leaking and holds all the water. Similarly, a sadh=\r\naka who is accumulating some shakti through sadhana and does not leak that =\r\nenergy through acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serv=\r\ne dharma better.\n\nIf there are 12 people who maintain physical and mental b=\r\nrahmacharya for a few years while doing homam everyday, I think the world c=\r\nan be changed.\n\n* * *\n\nIf an aghora sits naked with partner and chants mant=\r\nra, please remember that the goal isn&#39;t having sex. This practice is by mea=\r\nns a glorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*.\n Even if the mind is ov=\r\nerwhelmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the goal=\r\n is to reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy as =\r\nsomething to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahmacha=\r\nrya can be maintained despite such provocation.\n\nIn fact, the true meaning =\r\nof brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to refrai=\r\nn from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be abl=\r\ne to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain phys=\r\nical brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain from me=\r\nntal thoughts.\n\nAn aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those thoug=\r\nhts in his mind (what Manish called as &quot;sampradaaha&quot; ). Mind considers some=\r\n things as pure and some things as impure. The &quot;impure&quot; objects and circums=\r\ntances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other distur=\r\nbance to the mind and waver it\n from god. But an aghora puts them right in =\r\nthe middle of a &quot;pure&quot; activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to deal =\r\nwith them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill or o=\r\nther disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impure=\r\n! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure abo=\r\nut it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind and=\r\n waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, what i=\r\ns impure about it?\n\nThat is the basic thinking in this practice. Some yogis=\r\n may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to opposi=\r\nte sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in front of a =\r\nnaked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, his mind=\r\n may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to incinerate =\r\nthe very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be aroused=\r\n by, not by\n staying away from it but by being with it and yet trying to fo=\r\ncus the mind on god.\n\nBottomline: An aghora engaging in this practice may s=\r\ntray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to attain more per=\r\nfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to attain brahmach=\r\narya.\n\nIf one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning of sadhana, it ma=\r\ny be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to somehow or the othe=\r\nr attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.\n\n* * *\n\nThe coa=\r\nrse meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy.\n\nThe finer meaning of bra=\r\nhmacharya is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual thoughts even=\r\n in the mind.\n\nThe finest meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust, =\r\nanger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in Bra=\r\nhman always. Brahmacharya literally means &quot;engaging in Brahman or Self&quot;. On=\r\ne experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy\n etc only when one&#39;s mind perceiv=\r\nes and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful la=\r\ndy, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being appreciated more than me e=\r\ntc) and NOT when one&#39;s mind engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmacha=\r\nrya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start with physical celibac=\r\ny and control over anger.\n\nRome is not built in a day.\n\nBottomline: It is v=\r\nery important to keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. St=\r\nart off with some level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes =\r\non. Never be frustrated with lack of progress and keep trying.\n\n* * *\n\nBTW,=\r\n regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be b=\r\nurning in the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there consuming =\r\nyour offerings, even after it seems like there is no fire.\n\nKeep it as chea=\r\np as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood stick=\r\ns\n collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need.\n\nBest rega=\r\nrds,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nS=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@yahoo. c=\r\nom&gt; wrote: \n&gt; NAMASKAR to all\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama f=\r\nor the last three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus=\r\n of this beautiful forum...\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I need some practical approach best su=\r\nitable for me...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

Others answered your questions and I will leave them. But I wa=\r\nnt to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on aghora seems to ha=\r\nve created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand when we are com=\r\nmunicating verbally, because one&#39;s own mental conditioning has a role in de=\r\nciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-text. It is more s=\r\no when we are talking about delicate matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; 3. W=\r\nhen the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, is it really needed&lt;br&gt;&gt; to perfor=\r\nm &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brahmacharya is very imp=\r\nortant in any spiritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan said, sexual activity r=\r\nesults in loss of ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a part of one&#39;s creativ=\r\ne essence. Doing sadhana without brahmacharya is like filling a water pot t=\r\nhat is leaking through a hole. Even if you succeed in filling the pot with =\r\nwater, it will soon become\n empty!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as a filled water pot that i=\r\ns leaking may still satisfy the thirst of someone who takes a glass of wate=\r\nr from it, similarly a person doing sadhana without brahmacharya may someti=\r\nmes be able to do his dharma and serve his purpose in the world. So, it is =\r\na good idea to do sadhana even as one&#39;s brahmacharya is not good yet. But, =\r\nthe best will be if the filled water pot is not leaking and holds all the w=\r\nater. Similarly, a sadhaka who is accumulating some shakti through sadhana =\r\nand does not leak that energy through acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy e=\r\ntc will be able to serve dharma better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there are 12 people who m=\r\naintain physical and mental brahmacharya for a few years while doing homam =\r\neveryday, I think the world can be changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If an aghor=\r\na sits naked with partner and chants mantra, please remember that the goal =\r\nisn&#39;t having sex. This practice is by means a glorification of sex. The goa=\r\nl is to *resist*.\n Even if the mind is overwhelmed in the beginning with th=\r\nrill and one ends up having sex, the goal is to reach a stage where mind is=\r\n not looking at nakedness or intimacy as something to be excited about. The=\r\n goal is to reach a stage where brahmacharya can be maintained despite such=\r\n provocation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, the true meaning of brahmacharya is not only =\r\nto refrain from physical sex but also to refrain from sexual thoughts in th=\r\ne mind. Many married people of today may be able to set time limits (e.g. 4=\r\n0 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain physical brahmacharya for that t=\r\nime, but it may be difficult to refrain from mental thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An agh=\r\nora tries to incinerate the root cause of those thoughts in his mind (what =\r\nManish called as &quot;sampradaaha&quot; ). Mind considers some things as pure and so=\r\nme things as impure. The &quot;impure&quot; objects and circumstances are considered =\r\nimpure because they cause thrill or some other disturbance to the mind and =\r\nwaver it\n from god. But an aghora puts them right in the middle of a &quot;pure&quot;=\r\n activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to deal with them. After some =\r\ntime, the impure objects do not cause any thrill or other disturbance to wa=\r\nver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impure! For example, what is=\r\n impure about a naked body? The only thing impure about it is that it arous=\r\nes certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind and waver it from god. If=\r\n a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, what is impure about it?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;That is the basic thinking in this practice. Some yogis may physically =\r\nabstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to opposite sex, for seve=\r\nral decades. But, if such a person is placed in front of a naked beauty, wh=\r\nat thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, his mind may indeed be d=\r\nisturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to incinerate the very notion =\r\nin the mind that so and so thing is something to be aroused by, not by\n sta=\r\nying away from it but by being with it and yet trying to focus the mind on =\r\ngod.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottomline: An aghora engaging in this practice may stray from =\r\nbrahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to attain more perfect brahm=\r\nacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to attain brahmacharya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;If one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning of sadhana, it may be=\r\n ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to somehow or the other at=\r\ntain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The coarse meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The finer =\r\nmeaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual=\r\n thoughts even in the mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The finest meaning of brahmacharya is re=\r\nfraining from lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and esta=\r\nblishing mind in Brahman always. Brahmacharya literally means &quot;engaging in =\r\nBrahman or Self&quot;. One experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy\n etc only whe=\r\nn one&#39;s mind perceives and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self =\r\n(e.g. a beautiful lady, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being apprec=\r\niated more than me etc) and NOT when one&#39;s mind engages in true Self. Thus =\r\nthe truest brahmacharya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start w=\r\nith physical celibacy and control over anger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rome is not built in a=\r\n day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottomline: It is very important to keep brahmacharya, even us=\r\ning the coarse meaning above. Start off with some level of brahmacharya and=\r\n try to improve it as time goes on. Never be frustrated with lack of progre=\r\nss and keep trying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, regarding (4), even after fire=\r\n goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be burning in the ember form for a =\r\nlong time. So Agni is still there consuming your offerings, even after it s=\r\neems like there is no fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep it as cheap as you can, based on yo=\r\nur financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood sticks\n collected manually and=\r\n some sesame seeds may be all you need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms=\r\n.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---- biswa108 &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;\n yma=\r\nilto=3D&quot;mailto:biswa1975%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose=\r\n?to=3Dbiswa1975%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;biswa1975@yahoo. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; N=\r\nAMASKAR to all&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama for =\r\nthe last three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of=\r\n this beautiful forum...&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now I need some practical approac=\r\nh best suitable for me...&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 1.
