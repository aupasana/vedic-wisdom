When I was meditating before replying to you, a really beautif=\r\nul and meaningful analogy came to me and I think it is worth sharing with m=\r\nore people than just you. To ensure your anonymity, I removed references in=\r\n the quoted mail below that may help one identify you.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFirst I will answer your first question=\r\n in detail, because that can automatically answer other questions.\n=A0\n\n&gt; 1=\r\n. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras\n&gt; (peopl=\r\ne explain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas,\n&gt; but clas=\r\nsified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?\n=A0\n\n*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhen people say what is =\r\nin Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. They are only fooling t=\r\nhemselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or mastering a celebrated comme=\r\nntary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, understanding each single=\r\n verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understanding a verse in Veda is=\r\n neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingal=\r\na nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with energy flowing in Sus=\r\nhumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor logic, but only with =\r\n*revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expression, direct knowle=\r\ndge.\n=A0\nWhen one meditates long enough on a verse, the verse may simply be=\r\n revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understand a Vedic verse. Fo=\r\nr most people, it is not possible to decipher even a single verse in an ent=\r\nire life, let alone a passage.\n=A0\nBottomoline is: Almost nobody understand=\r\ns Veda today. What are considered &quot;pure vaidika rituals&quot; are merely another=\r\n variety of rituals created by someone at some point of time. From the poin=\r\nt of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no difference betwee=\r\nn them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly believe otherwis=\r\ne.\n=A0\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nA simple analog=\r\ny may help clarify a lot of things related to this complicated issue a litt=\r\nle. What the thing in the analogy represents is shown here and there in squ=\r\nare brackets [].\n=A0\nOnce there were many people who lived near the sea [Br=\r\nahman/Aatman] . They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and=A0s=\r\nound of the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice =\r\ncryptic poems [Veda].\n=A0\nAs people started living a little away from the s=\r\nea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruction=\r\ns on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the ins=\r\ntructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [ritu=\r\nals].\n=A0\nPeople started moving further and further inland and started livi=\r\nng in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never =\r\nseen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performe=\r\nd the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated en=\r\ndlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and fo=\r\nrmed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found=\r\n a tree or a building or some interesting object=A0and even became satisfie=\r\nd that that was sea!\n=A0\nThen came some great person, whose instincts led h=\r\nim to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use =\r\nof other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together ne=\r\nwer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagam=\r\nas].\n=A0\nPeople performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but t=\r\nhen this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path =\r\nand different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic ritual]. By now, pe=\r\nople did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book o=\r\nf sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure=\r\n&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the=\r\n original instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the =\r\nnewer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew wher=\r\ne they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n=A0\nSlowly man=\r\ny new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and m=\r\nany new paths to the sea were=A0outlined=A0instead of just instructing peop=\r\nle to walk towards east=A0[evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].\n=A0\nOne pa=\r\nrticular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric =\r\npaths involving practice of sex, meat, wine=A0etc]. Though the distance to =\r\nsea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and onl=\r\ny the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wil=\r\nd animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travell=\r\ning to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territ=\r\nory well=A0came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from tr=\r\nying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfu=\r\nlly make it in that path desisted from it.\n=A0\nAs time progressed, people s=\r\ntarted fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, =\r\nnot smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-calle=\r\nd &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the =\r\nchanged geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly=\r\n, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reachi=\r\nng the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought th=\r\ney were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no nee=\r\nd to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condem=\r\nned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions f=\r\nor their place and=A0time, for violating tradition.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIn case the analogy is not clear, here is =\r\na brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes=\r\n various aspects of=A0the state of self-realization. That is why it is cons=\r\nidered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on pos=\r\nsible ways to reach that state. While definitive statements can be made on =\r\nthe actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can b=\r\ne made on how to reach it. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n=A0\n=\r\nGreat men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it=\r\n, came, experienced that state, understood the current state of people arou=\r\nnd them=A0and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from th=\r\ne current state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. =\r\nSome instead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n=A0\nPleas=\r\ne re-read the story and try to understand what each part of the story repre=\r\nsents. If you understand this analogy well, this can really clarify the mea=\r\nningless nature of so many debates that people waste time with!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n\n&gt; 2. I read from somewhere th=\r\nat Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned\n&gt; Tantrik practices. But I also hear a=\r\nnd read that he is a great Sri Vidya\n&gt; Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has it=\r\ns roots from Tantra, what did\n&gt; Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n=A0\nHe did condem=\r\nn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, al=\r\ncohol, meat etc.\n=A0\nHowever, please go back to my analogy. A great man may=\r\n condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wild a=\r\nnimals and=A0dacoits and many travellers through that path recently lost th=\r\neir lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only means th=\r\nat too many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it of lat=\r\ne and so the great man was compelled to stop the practice.\n=A0\nIf the same =\r\ngreat man is reincarnated at a different time when several adept souls he h=\r\nas a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn the path an=\r\nd instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully!\n=A0\nThe words of =\r\ngreat masters need to be interpreted within the context of their desa, kaal=\r\na and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that particular birth=\r\n.\n=A0\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n\n&gt; 3. What is va=\r\nmachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,\n&gt; why must it be =\r\npracticed at all?\n=A0\nSuppose one&#39;s house is close to the market and the ma=\r\nrket noise reaches one&#39;s house. Suppose that noise=A0is disturbing one&#39;s me=\r\nditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are =\r\ntwo approaches one can take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of =\r\nsolitude and meditate there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right ther=\r\ne and develop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. g=\r\net mastery and control over the part of the mind that is making one vulnera=\r\nble to this disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the probl=\r\nem - the problem is the *inability* of one&#39;s mind to turn off that sensory =\r\ninput. By controlling one&#39;s mind, one can focus attention on god irrespecti=\r\nve of what is happening outside.\n=A0\nApproach (1) is not bad. If one is wea=\r\nk-minded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then approac=\r\nh (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind a=\r\nnd can succeed with approach (2), it is great. It hastens one&#39;s progress.\n=\r\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nVaamaachaara is als=\r\no like that, but a more extreme form of testing one&#39;s self-control by risin=\r\ng to the challenge.\n=A0\nPlease realize that vaamaachaara/ aghora is not abo=\r\nut the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about their use to te=\r\nst oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one&#39;s self-control. Self-r=\r\nealization comes when self-control is perfect and one&#39;s mind can always be =\r\nfocussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If one is either att=\r\nracted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization=\r\n.\n=A0\nHowever, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara.=\r\n One needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure y=\r\nogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with all his mind eve=\r\nn when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly e=\r\nmbracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control and hone it. Bu=\r\nt, if that is going to=A0tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a p=\r\nhysical enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as one who does =\r\nnot have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude a=\r\nnd hone one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the=\r\n focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, m=\r\neat and sex should stay away from those.\n=A0\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIn my analogy before, the short jungle path to the=\r\n sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaacha=\r\nara path of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal to battle and kill th=\r\ne wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one may be killed. Similarly, o=\r\nne who wants self-realization using this path will fall if one does not hav=\r\ne perfect self-control. If one takes this path because it sounds cool or ex=\r\nciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for the fittest and bravest.\n=A0\n=\r\nIf there is ANY weakness in one&#39;s self-control, one can NOT follow this pat=\r\nh. Just as there are many paths from the desert to the sea in my analogy, t=\r\nhere are many paths to self-realization. One should follow the path that is=\r\n appropriate for one based on previous samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.=\r\n\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&gt; Is it not a fact=\r\n that Sri Ambal lies above all these? \n=A0\n:-) Sri Ambal (the Divine Mother=\r\n) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All knowledge,=\r\n all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different manifestat=\r\nions.\n=A0\nIf a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and=A0sits naked =\r\nwith a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keeps his mind f=\r\nully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are all different =\r\nmanifestations of the Divine Mother only.\n=A0\nAs a matter of fact, even if =\r\none gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his desires an=\r\nd actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Moth=\r\ner gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains of respons=\r\nibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She tak=\r\nes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are a=\r\nctually Her manifestations only.\n=A0\nHowever, those who are more comfortabl=\r\ne with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will lo=\r\nok at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain in =\r\nduality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reality is =\r\nthat She is All.\n=A0\nI need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a=\r\n few things in perspective.

Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; (people explain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;When people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. They are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or mastering a celebrated commentary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, understanding each single verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understanding a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with energy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor logic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expression, direct knowledge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;When one meditates long enough on a verse, the verse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understand a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible to decipher even a single verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Bottomoline is: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are considered &quot;pure vaidika rituals&quot; are merely another variety of rituals created by someone at some point of time. From the point of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no difference between them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly believe otherwise.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;A simple analogy may help clarify a lot of things related to this complicated issue a little. What the thing in the analogy represents is shown here and there in square brackets [].&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aatman] . They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and&nbsp;sound of the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;As people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;People started moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. T&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;hey faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object&nbsp;and even became satisfied that that was sea!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagamas].&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;People performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were&nbsp;outlined&nbsp;instead of just instructing people to walk towards east&nbsp;[evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine&nbsp;etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well&nbsp;came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;As time progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and&nbsp;time, for violating tradition.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes various aspects of&nbsp;the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive statements can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current state of people around them&nbsp;and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Please re-read the story and try to understand what each part of the story represents. If you understand this analogy well, this can really clarify the meaningless nature of so many debates that people waste time with!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; Sri Adi Sankara condemn? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;He did condemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, alcohol, meat etc.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;However, please go back to my analogy. A great man may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wild animals and&nbsp;dacoits and many travellers through that path recently lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that path are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the practice.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;If the same great man is reincarnated at a different time when several adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn the path and instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;The words of great masters need to be interpreted within the context of their desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that particular birth.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; why must it be practiced at all?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Suppose one&#39;s house is close to the market and the market noise reaches one&#39;s house. Suppose that noise&nbsp;is disturbing one&#39;s meditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are two approaches one can take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right there and develop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is the *inability* of one&#39;s mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling one&#39;s mind, one can focus attention on god irrespective of what is happening outside.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Approach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with approach (2), it is great. It hastens one&#39;s progress.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Vaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of testing one&#39;s self-control by rising to the challenge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Please realize that vaamaachaara/ aghora is not about the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one&#39;s self-control. Self-realization comes when self-control is perfect and one&#39;s mind can always be focussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If one is either attracted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with all his mind even when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control and hone it. But, if that is going to&nbsp;tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a physical enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as one who does not have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and hone one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, meat and sex should stay away from those.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;In my analogy before, the short jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path will fall if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes this path because it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for the fittest and bravest.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;If there is ANY weakness in one&#39;s self-control, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the desert to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One should follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&gt; Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;:-) Sri Ambal (the Divine Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All knowledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different manifestations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and&nbsp;sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keeps his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are all different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;As a matter of fact, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his desires and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are actually Her manifestations only.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;However, those who are more comfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will look at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain in duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reality is that She is All.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;I need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yahoogroups or to me privately.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial\n size=2&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=ltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Sri Sri NarasimhaJI&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Namaskarams.

Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras (people explain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas, but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks etc, why must it be practiced at all? Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;I am a little (totally) confused. Hope your reply takes me out of the well to ask you more questions&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Namaskarams&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Venkat&lt;BR clear=all&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-- &lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-1300179621-1219082583=:44723--\r\n\n"}}
