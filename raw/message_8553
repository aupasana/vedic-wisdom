He infl=\r\nates a few balloons, ties a\nthread around each one and wraps those threads =\r\naround his fingers. When\nsomeone comes to buy a balloon, he removes one fro=\r\nm one of his fingers and\ngives it away. Then he inflates another balloon an=\r\nd ties it to his finger\nagain.\n\nOur mind is like the balloon seller. Myriad=\r\n different objects in the world\nentice us like balloons and our desires are=\r\n like the threads that keep our\nmind attached to the objects.  The moment o=\r\nne desired object is acquired,\nit gets detached from our mind. But our mind=\r\n immediately inflates another\none and promptly gets attached to it!\n\nNow, w=\r\nhen does the balloon seller stop this repeated activity of detaching\nand re=\r\nattaching balloons to his fingers? Possibly, at the end of his work\nday whe=\r\nn he thinks he must go home now. Then he disposes off his last\nballoon and =\r\ndoes not inflate any more balloons. So, now he becomes detached\nfrom the ba=\r\nlloons, but only temporarily. Again, the next morning, he is out\nto repeat =\r\nthe cycle of inflating, attaching and detaching balloons.\nLikewise, we also=\r\n take a temporary respite when our life ends, but only to\nrestart the repet=\r\nitive cycle of desires all over again in the next life.\n\nIs there a final e=\r\nnd to this cycle? When the balloon seller becomes old, he\nmay finally decid=\r\ne that he can no longer continue going out and selling\nballoons. So, he wil=\r\nl then hang up his boots and be free from the\nrepetitive inflate-attach-det=\r\nach cycle. Similarly, we have to develop a\nlasting vairagya bhav =E2=80=93 =\r\ncultivate a strong determination -- that makes us\nlose all interest in worl=\r\ndly pursuits driven otherwise by unending desires.\nThat is when we will be =\r\nreleased from the repetitive cycle of birth and\ndeath.\n\nIt is said that a s=\r\nincere spiritual seeker should cultivate true\ndetachment. So then, he would=\r\n tell himself that he should reduce his\nattachment, for example, to smoking=\r\n. He may manage it with considerable\neffort after some time. But that is on=\r\nly one attachment gone and we tend to\nhave so many of them! We can imagine =\r\nthe plight of someone trying to detach\nhimself from good food, sports, ente=\r\nrtainment, hobbies, spouse, children,\ngrand children, friends and so on. It=\r\n is like the balloon seller having too\nmany balloons tied around his finger=\r\ns and their threads getting entangled\nwith each other, complicating the pro=\r\ncess of detachment.\n\nHow does one manage to get detached from the whole of =\r\nsamsara without\nhaving to go on trying infinitely to painfully detach from =\r\nmany objects one\nby one? As we can see, there are so many different objects=\r\n at the far end\nof our attachments. Trying to get rid of those objects one =\r\nby one is indeed\nextremely difficult. However, at the near end, there is ju=\r\nst a single\nentity involved in all these attachments. That single entity is=\r\n your\nlimited bodily identity or ego. That is the driver behind the various=\r\n\nattachments forming. So, if this single entity is removed, all the many\nob=\r\njects at the far end will be instantly detached.  Thus, it should be\nrelati=\r\nvely easier to detach yourself from samsara if you can manage to get\nrid of=\r\n your ego.\n\nIt is by our Sadguru=E2=80=99s grace that we can manage to rid =\r\nourselves of our ego\nand develop a durable vairagya bhav that alone can lea=\r\nd us to moksha or\nliberation.\nkishorkulkarni@...\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n\r\n--0016e6de1474af36ea04c62ef9e4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://timesofindia.speakingtree.in/spiritual-articles/scie=\r\nnce-of-spirituality/attachment-and-detachment&quot;&gt;http://timesofindia.speaking=\r\ntree.in/spiritual-articles/science-of-spirituality/attachment-and-detachmen=\r\nt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Have you observed a balloon seller?.
