You can break each \ncoconut Hal=\r\nf with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.\n\n2) A very small bowl of=\r\n Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is \nsufficient as &#39;Ghee Aahutis&#39; are =\r\nto be given as only a single drop \nwhenever it is mentioned in the Manual.\n=\r\n\n3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically not mentioned, one can offer \nAaahut=\r\nis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya \netc... Now o=\r\nne can choose each of the above stuffs one by one for \noffering as aahuti o=\r\nr can use single stuff.\n\nto elaborate, at each Swaha, one can take One Kish=\r\nmis or Few Mamara \nor one almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer =\r\nto Agni.\n\nIf you have Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuf=\r\nf \nwhich can be offer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered as \nAah=\r\nuti same as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take \nvery little=\r\n &#39;Havan samgri powder and offer it.\n\nThus one person can easily perform hom=\r\nam as explained above because \nfirstly, one doesn&#39;t need to give Aahutis of=\r\n Ghee and other stuff \nsimultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can=\r\n be done with \nleft fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.\n\n2 kg of =\r\nHavan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms \nwill be sufficien=\r\nt if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..\n\n4) The Homa Fire represen=\r\nts Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. \nhence it is suggested that Aahutis=\r\n are only offered by You alone \nwhile mother and others can sit beside you =\r\nand concentrate. they \nwill gain lot of spiritual benefit just by attending=\r\n.\n\n5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that copper one can \nalso=\r\n be used.\n\n6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who offer ghee \n=\r\naahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i think i&#39;ve also seen \nthat =\r\nduring Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatri. I suppose it \nalso must b=\r\ne one of the right ways. however i have complete faith in \nwhat Narasimha h=\r\nas given in Manual and that also must be the other \nright way of many ways.=\r\n although you can choose between the above \ntwo, i recommend to go as per t=\r\nhe Manual if you are going to do as \nper the manual given by him.\n\nLastly, =\r\ni would suggest not to bother yourself with much \ntechnicalities and burden=\r\n of perfection. in the first few runs, \nthere are many things during Havan =\r\nwhich can go imperefct. do as per \nmanual and enjoy you Homam with your mot=\r\nher & others and offcourse \nwith the mother of universe !!!\n\nI hope, i gave=\r\n you the answers - Beautifully.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n&lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n&gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ &gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I want to do homam for =\r\nchandi \ndevi.I \n&gt; &gt; had arranged a copper tray in square shape.Almost 1 fee=\r\nt by 1 \n&gt; feet. \n&gt; &gt; So is it good measurement or not ?
