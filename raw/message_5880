I was thinki=\r\nng that I am having some &#39;Hocus-Pocus illusions&#39; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I have one more do=\r\nubt. In my regular sadhna practice, Sometimes I am doing very good and conc=\r\nentration,experience is very good. But sometimes concentration is very poor=\r\n, I dont even want to meditate. Even slight meditation feels like headache =\r\nbecause of poor concentration. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is basically like hiting peak and b=\r\nottom turn by turn. After I hit bottom I start to improve and after i touch=\r\n peak I fall down suddenly. \n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that this is due to my own i=\r\nncompetency in sadhna. Most probably I commit some mistake when at peak and=\r\n then I loose my balance. But I make mistakes even when I am going up, but =\r\nthen I do not loose balance and instead i rectify my mistakes very well. Wh=\r\nen I am having my best experience, a small mistake make me loose my balance=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I dont know why this happens. Does this happen to everyone or I am l=\r\nacking ability to do sadhna? This disappoints me a lot. During some days I =\r\neven do not do my regular practice and I feel that I am not worthy of doing=\r\n sadhna. I feel guilty of forgetting Krishna. Suddenly lot and lot of non-s=\r\nense questions and stupid ideas arise in mind and I am totally confused. Du=\r\nring those days, I dont even remember Krishna. I dont even want to hymn my =\r\nfavourite mantra. I do not bother about pleasant experience. I know these a=\r\nre not my aim. But I feel disappointed for forgetting Krishna. During these=\r\n days every day feels like I have forgotten him since decades. This disappo=\r\nints me even more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this happen to everyone? Any suggestion will b=\r\ne helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that we should not share our spiritual experie=\r\nnce with everyone. But today I was not able to stop myself.

Until, of course he &gt;&gt;is initiated into religion.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Pure rational intelligence will be thoroughly logical and would want evide=\r\nnces (which can be perceived by physical senses) for anything and everythin=\r\ng. Same goes for existence of God/Nature/Self/etc...so the by product is la=\r\nck of belief in the core essence and purpose of religion i.e. Spirit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; He/she will naturally lack faith (Shradhdhaa). Whenever, in life, due to=\r\n bitter experiences and/or past Samskaaraas, Logic takes backseat and Faith=\r\n is born, the person is initiated in to religion. It is actually Initiation=\r\n in to internal religion which may or may not reflect externally.
