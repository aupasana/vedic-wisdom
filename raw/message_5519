If you keep polluting the list with this attitude, I will have to ba=\r\nn you from the list. We welcome all views, but one can disagree with great =\r\nscholars and masters without belittling them or adopting an all-knowing and=\r\n dismissive attitude.\n\nAadi Shankara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In =\r\nfact, if you study his works, you will be amazed at some of the subtle tech=\r\nnical nusances in his commentaries, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit sc=\r\nholarship, scholarship in Vedic scriptures, breadth of commentaries of Vedi=\r\nc literature and the linguistic richness of compositions, Aadi Shankara sta=\r\nnds tall among all scholars of Kali yuga so far. You cannot take one specif=\r\nic line about the importance of devotion out of context and portray the gre=\r\natest and most prolific scholar of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nSanskrit is a very useful language. So much great literature that s=\r\nhows various paths to reaching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many =\r\nSanskrit mantras directly resonate with the energy centers in one&#39;s subtle =\r\nconsciousness. So, if one wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptur=\r\nes/classics in Sanskrit, it is a great idea.\n\nAt the same time, Shankara&#39;s =\r\nadvice of chanting the name of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities =\r\ndo not rescue one in the final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal=\r\n god or *complete* surrender to personal or impersonal god is the thing tha=\r\nt saves one in the end. Learning various shastras, performing various ritua=\r\nls, disciplining the mind with various activities, keeping the company of t=\r\nhe saintly - all these are for the purpose of increasing devotion and surre=\r\nnder. Depending on one&#39;s rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in =\r\nvarious activities, such as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying =\r\nprayers, doing rituals etc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the fi=\r\nnal goal, so that people do not forget it and get bogged down.\n\nIf one want=\r\ning to climb a mountain keeps walking around the mountain to find the best =\r\npath to climb, one may eventually forget that the goal is to climb the moun=\r\ntain and be stuck at the base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning th=\r\nis and that forever may forget that reaching god is the final goal and get =\r\nstuck. So compassionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nI am reminded of a small episode from the life of Swami Vivekananda=\r\n.\n\nSwami Vivekananda said at a San Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple of a=\r\n man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoe=\r\ns. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the =\r\nGanges!&quot;\n\nStudent said, &quot;But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.&quot;\n=\r\n\nSwami Vivekananda said, &quot;That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 l=\r\nike I am.&quot;\n\nVivekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viv=\r\neka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but because TRU=\r\nE viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was to real=\r\nize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).=\r\n\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters aro=\r\nund the world,\n&gt; does speak a lot about his immaturity in disseminating his=\r\n teachings in a\n&gt; useful manner.\n\nMaturity of a teacher is not measured by =\r\nthe following. And great teachers do not care about being &quot;celebrated&quot;.\n\nIn=\r\n any case, it is not true that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A signi=\r\nficant percentage of Vedanta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influen=\r\nced heavily by Adi Shankara&#39;s commentaries. He shaped the thinking of India=\r\nn philosophers for many many generations.\n\nApart from his scholarly works, =\r\nthe mutts established by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a s=\r\nignificant percentage of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.\n\nAny teach=\r\nings in written/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The w=\r\nords of great great teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very qui=\r\nckly. Only the teachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their =\r\nability to influence the thinking of people forever (or for really long per=\r\niods). Adi Shankara&#39;s words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers -=\r\n have retained their meaning and power for more than a couple of millennia.=\r\n The longevity of his works is amazing.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is ok to have strong opi=\r\nnions. As people&#39;s understanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wi=\r\nse ones try not to offend others with their strong opinions. In any case, i=\r\nnsulting saints, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understan=\r\nding of their teachings, is not good karma.

If you keep polluting the list with this attitude, I w=\r\nill have to ban you from the list. We welcome all views, but one can disagr=\r\nee with great scholars and masters without belittling them or adopting an a=\r\nll-knowing and dismissive attitude.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Aadi Shankara was not anti Veda =\r\nor anti grammar. In fact, if you study his works, you will be amazed at som=\r\ne of the subtle technical nusances in his commentaries, w.r.t. grammar. In =\r\nterms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in Vedic scriptures, breadth of =\r\ncommentaries of Vedic literature and the\n linguistic richness of compositio=\r\nns, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all scholars of Kali yuga so far. You c=\r\nannot take one specific line about the importance of devotion out of contex=\r\nt and portray the greatest and most prolific scholar of Kali yuga in an ant=\r\ni-scholarship light.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sanskrit is a very useful language=\r\n. So much great literature that shows various paths to reaching god is avai=\r\nlable in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras directly resonate with th=\r\ne energy centers in one&#39;s subtle consciousness. So, if one wants to learn S=\r\nanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in Sanskrit, it is a great ide=\r\na.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the same time, Shankara&#39;s advice of chanting the name of Govin=\r\nda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue one in the final momen=\r\nts, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complete* surrender to pers=\r\nonal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in the end. Learning var=\r\nious shastras, performing various\n rituals, disciplining the mind with vari=\r\nous activities, keeping the company of the saintly - all these are for the =\r\npurpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending on one&#39;s rinas and =\r\nconditioning, one is bound to engage in various activities, such as learnin=\r\ng Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing rituals etc. But, ma=\r\nsters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so that people do not for=\r\nget it and get bogged down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one wanting to climb a mountain keeps=\r\n walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, one may eventu=\r\nally forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stuck at the base=\r\n forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that forever may forge=\r\nt that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compassionate maste=\r\nrs may sometimes remind us of the final goal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am remi=\r\nnded of a small episode from the life of Swami Vivekananda.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda said at a San\n Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple of a man who c=\r\nould not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How oft=\r\nen have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!&quot;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Student said, &quot;But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Swami Vivekananda said, &quot;That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94=\r\n like I am.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vivekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he=\r\n had viveka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but bec=\r\nause TRUE viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was=\r\n to realize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrimination of logica=\r\nl mind).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in a rela=\r\ntively few quarters around the world,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; does speak a lot about his im=\r\nmaturity in disseminating his teachings in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; useful manner.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nMaturity of a teacher is not measured by the following. And great teachers =\r\ndo not care about being\n &quot;celebrated&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In any case, it is not true t=\r\nhat Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percentage of Vedant=\r\na scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shankara=\r\n&#39;s commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosophers for many man=\r\ny generations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Apart from his scholarly works, the mutts established=\r\n by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant percentage=\r\n of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Any teachings in written=\r\n/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great g=\r\nreat teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only the =\r\nteachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to infl=\r\nuence the thinking of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Shan=\r\nkara&#39;s words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retained =\r\ntheir meaning and power for more than a couple of millennia. The longevity =\r\nof his works is\n amazing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is ok to have strong opini=\r\nons. As people&#39;s understanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise=\r\n ones try not to offend others with their strong opinions. In any case, ins=\r\nulting saints, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understandi=\r\nng of their teachings, is not good karma. I request members to be considera=\r\nte, tolerant and respectful to others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedi=\r\ncastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.=\r\norg/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Spir=\r\nituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyo=\r\ntish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--=\r\n-- silentadmirer_in &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compos=\r\ne?to=3Dsilentadmirer_in%40yahoo.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;silenta=\r\ndmirer_in@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaskar smartxpark,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wha=\r\nt you say is correct, Sanskrit and its grammar gives one a high that other =\r\nlanguages do not.
