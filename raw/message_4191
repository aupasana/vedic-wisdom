Then he and his\ndisciples would go for bhiksha.This Satsangh was=\r\n going on for some time.\nThen in the same period, he composed Sri Annapurna=\r\n Ashtakam and Sri Kasi\nViswanatha Ashtakam. Nityanandakari Varabhayakari So=\r\nundarya Ratnakari......\nGangadharanga kamaneeya Jadakalabam......\n\nThere in=\r\n Kasi, one miracle also took place upon Sankara. He had his early\nmorning b=\r\nath and was returning in one of the bylanes to his residence. He\nfound an o=\r\nutcaste, a dog eater, smelling of toddy all over his body, in\ntattered clot=\r\nhes, without any bath for days, holding a oozing toddy leather\npouch on his=\r\n shoulders, -- coming on the opposite direction. There was no\nspace to go f=\r\nor both, without brushing on each other. Some stories say that\neven wife of=\r\n outcaste,came with him.\n\nSankara says: Andhi vesha dharam dhrushtva gacha =\r\ngacha idhi cha abravit....\nO outcaste! Move away! Move away!\n\nThe outcaste =\r\nasks Sankara:\n\n1. O noble among the brahmins! Whom do you want to move away=\r\n? Is it one body\nwhich is made up of food to the other body which is also m=\r\nade up of food?\nOr, should the Chaitanya in me move away from the Chaitanya=\r\n that is in you?\n\n2. Is there any difference between the Sun that is reflec=\r\nting on Ganga and\nthe ditch water that is near my home? Is the Space that i=\r\ns within a gold\nvessel, different from the Space that is within a mud pot? =\r\nWherefrom do you\nget the delusion, in the all-expanding Pure Space which is=\r\n the waveless\nOcean of Bliss, as between a brahmin and a dog eating out cas=\r\nte?\n\nSankara thought for a second about this mind-blowing question! He medi=\r\ntated\nand looked in front and could see Siva and Uma,smiling. Siva was hold=\r\ning the\nleash of four dogs! He looked in the form of Kalabairava!\n\nSankara =\r\nthen sang in a cry:\n\n3. That eternal Pure Awareness, which is the Witness o=\r\nf wakeful, dreaming\nand deep sleep states, which is in all souls from an an=\r\nt to Brahma, as the\nsphurna, as I,I,I.., the One who is having this stable =\r\nAtmajnana, he is my\nGuru regardless of whether he is a brahmin or an outcas=\r\nte!\n\n4.I am Brahman.This entire universe is the expansion of this one\nBrahm=\r\nan-consciousness.I am unaware of this only due to my sattvic,rajas and\ntama=\r\ns characteristics which produce this ignorance and I am deluded into\nthinki=\r\nng that all un-Brahman are Brahman. All these are delusions. There is\none P=\r\nure Awareness which is Brahman and this is all pervading. One who is\nhaving=\r\n this stable Brahma Jnana, he is my Guru, regardless of whether he is\na bra=\r\nhmin or an outcaste!\n\n5. With Guru&#39;s Upadesa, my determination that this en=\r\ntire universe is\nperishable will be strengthened. With that non vacillating=\r\n mind,I shall\nmeditate on Brahman and burn my past and future karmas in tha=\r\nt Pure\nAwareness. I shall leave this body to the current,Prarabdha Karma an=\r\nd remain\nunmoving. This is my conviction.\n\n(The Prayatna Mahavakyam, the gr=\r\neat saying for practise, is mentioned here:\nI am Brahman.

From this great ocean of bliss, ev=\r\nen Indra and Devas get satisfied by\ntaking a droplet.The peaceful Sages fee=\r\nl completion. The One who has merged\ninto that ocean of biss, Brahman, will=\r\n become Brahman. Who ever is such a\nrealized Sage, his feet are to be worsh=\r\nipped even by Indra.
