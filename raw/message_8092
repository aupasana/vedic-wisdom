I now am studying to do the standard homam as described in the or=\r\niginal manual. Surprising that after studying for 2-3 days the whole proced=\r\nure seems very easy. I never know it would seem this clear and easy. I gues=\r\ns once someone learns the basic steps (Anugya, Achamanam, Pranayamam and so=\r\n on) in short then there is divine bliss and soon he can learn them in deta=\r\nils also, without much problem.\n\nI have learned anganyasa, karanyasa and so=\r\nme other mudras from your Ganapati Homam video and by reading them on the n=\r\net I have a clear understanding. However I still have some confusions that =\r\nI couldn&#39;t clear up from other sources, hence these questions:\n\n1) While yo=\r\nu are saying &quot;Om shri Maha Ganapati Prana-Shaktyai Namah&quot; you are performin=\r\ng a mudra. If I understand it correctly, then it is -\n\nMiddle fingers join =\r\neach other.\nSmall fingers join thumbs.\nRing fingers join index fingers.\n\nAm=\r\n I right here to understand it?\n\n2) What is the name of this mudra?\n\n3) Sho=\r\nuld I perform this same mudra while performing invocation of the main deity=\r\n for other homam also? Such as Sani homam, Lakshmi homam etc. and all other=\r\ns? Or is this mudra for Maha Ganapati homam only?\n\n4) I understand all othe=\r\nr mudras but when you turn the palm downwards to perform samsthapani mudra,=\r\n are you STILL touching your ring finger&#39;s base with thumb&#39;s tip, like the =\r\nAvahani mudra? Or are you simply touching your palm with the thumb-tip? Bec=\r\nause your thumb is not visible from above.\n\nThanks\nTanvir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
