He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming in=\r\nto his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hid=\r\ne so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon =\r\nhimself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I wan=\r\nt him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying =\r\nto cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the w=\r\ninters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we a=\r\nbuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face,=\r\n is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wa=\r\nnts to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbl=\r\ned, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all=\r\n, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I=\r\n love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That =\r\nlast line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of lov=\r\ning the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere=\r\n usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives a=\r\nnd gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which l=\r\neads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s fore=\r\nmost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no=\r\n economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just=\r\n because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do m=\r\nost of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births com=\r\nbined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship busine=\r\nss. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a ma=\r\nn loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she=\r\n is a whore for that man.

What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you an=\r\nother story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with =\r\na certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him,=\r\n infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; act=\r\nually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndon&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me.

My\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main i=\r\nnk\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel m=\r\neri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more ins=\r\nane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he=\r\n went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo=\r\nve????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, a=\r\nnother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sa=\r\nke. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but=\r\n dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know=\r\n it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when di=\r\nd i become big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri ma=\r\na ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, tha=\r\nt god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, =\r\nand I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, =\r\ndeserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who =\r\nis eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have su=\r\nrrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered,=\r\n bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be tota=\r\nl, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up=\r\n and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai=\r\n bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sur=\r\nrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender=\r\n, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the sa=\r\nme thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to g=\r\nrace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will br=\r\neak his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devoti=\r\non and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or m=\r\nutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn=\r\n&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy =\r\nwants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with u=\r\ns , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy =\r\nwith what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chick=\r\nen, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero,=\r\n phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gop=\r\naal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsci=\r\nously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I neve=\r\nr want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only wan=\r\nt him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are self=\r\nish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that m=\r\nasterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blank=\r\net, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; nope.

It =\r\nbecomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who =\r\nis in love with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, i=\r\nn Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47=\r\n degree centigrades and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was =\r\ngetting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the=\r\n sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfort=\r\nable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked himself=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this ve=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with =\r\nsweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, comin=\r\ng out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to driv=\r\ne him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love?=\r\n?? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot;=\r\n ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profus=\r\nely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun=\r\n, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter wh=\r\nat.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summe=\r\nrs we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that or=\r\nb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all becau=\r\nse of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which lead=\r\ns to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, =\r\nthis planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no=\r\n gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, tru=\r\ne love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t gi=\r\nve one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talki=\r\nng about people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are=\r\n quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she do=\r\nesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man.=\r\n Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! =\r\nWah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a b=\r\noy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl =\r\nhas never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to h=\r\nis existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me =\r\nwhy/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridicul=\r\nously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you =\r\nso love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me.=\r\n He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide=\r\n her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mu=\r\njhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, =\r\napni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a =\r\nlot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told y=\r\nou that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love t=\r\nhen claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from Go=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The =\r\nmoment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, bu=\r\nt then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to =\r\nknow whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.=\r\n  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come=\r\n and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer tha=\r\nt she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if =\r\nI have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If yo=\r\nu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That does=\r\nn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I nee=\r\nd to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki =\r\nnaukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your dut=\r\ny, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;=\r\ngood&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually mana=\r\nge to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, beli=\r\neve you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhug=\r\ngi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by waggi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t a=\r\nsk the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His maste=\r\nr brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail =\r\nis wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an =\r\nafterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with god, =\r\nand what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master brin=\r\ngs, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya p=\r\naneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rah=\r\ne, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want=\r\n him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shi=\r\nt pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSC=\r\nIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bi=\r\ntch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rar=\r\nely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails =\r\nof great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the great dogs, =\r\nand pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is ment=\r\nal masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if y=\r\nou become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye=\r\n hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.
