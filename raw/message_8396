The system is designed to=\r\n keep you subservient and perpetuate itself.  Life is way too short to wast=\r\ne it.  Seek for a way out!  Sorcery and Tantra is about Freedom, especially=\r\n freedom from mental shackles.  It will give you the edge you need to get a=\r\nhead in life.  Seek for freedom from the Matrix and its archons.  Emancipat=\r\ne yourself even if it is only mentally!  You are a spark of the Divine and =\r\nare meant for greater things than this!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are couple of FB fo=\r\nrum but they mostly dish around sadhanas for solving issues and provide les=\r\ns theory on tantra. one guy post his tantra sadhana journey, all i can say =\r\nis that on that path fanatics only reach such high levels.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; an=\r\nd if you want to read about bhairavies \n&gt; &gt; (good interpretation must other=\r\nwise ull get lost in words)\n&gt; &gt; Diaries of a Bhairavi\n&gt; &gt; http://www.newrea=\r\nlities.com/index.php/component/content/category/170-diaries-of-bhairavi?sta=\r\nrt=3D50\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; there are enough clues to find her out. she is a dancer in=\r\n jakarta i guess. she teaches some basic classes also and quite accessible.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; in case you find any good links do share.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1=\r\n080@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nank you for the very interesting information about tantra, a subject I know=\r\n very little about. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds fascinating. Making an idol of =\r\nDurga from the mud collected from the house of a widow and a prostitute! I =\r\ninterpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart of a pr=\r\nostitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soil from =\r\nboth their houses is equally sacred. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad to hear you say=\r\n that tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very insp=\r\niring. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently r=\r\nead a wonderful book about the women saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of =\r\nthe Goddess&quot;, written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen)=\r\n. She asked the same question &quot;Where are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pan=\r\ndit ji replied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t stand on public stages and give se=\r\nminars, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to=\r\n India and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised sai=\r\nnts in the female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to meet some of the y=\r\noginis and Bhairavis you mention.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about tantra and=\r\n would like to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practi=\r\nce,  but I&#39;m open to learning about other paths (tantra probably includes J=\r\napa for all I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be great=\r\n. I see Durga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadh=\r\nana with me (because I&#39;m too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal=\r\n (actually they&#39;re the same in my head and are both my goal as my divine pa=\r\nrents). The cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alon=\r\ne could give them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani=\r\n asking for Krishna, and She gave Him to them! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please could y=\r\nou reccommend some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read an=\r\nd educate myself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My=\r\n only worhip of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her altern=\r\nately) is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai =\r\nNamaha) randomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of =\r\nthe Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added h=\r\nomams to my practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her a=\r\nnd Hari with it (it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put=\r\n a bit of heart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not=\r\n giving me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made=\r\n me, it&#39;s her own fault). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for the message, and h=\r\nere&#39;s to tantra, the path that treats women as equals! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
