They just mech=\r\nanically chant it and nothing happens. What you described tells me that you=\r\n were able to experience the manta to some extent. That is a good sign.\n \nT=\r\nhough I have never done the mantra you mentioned, from the name, I would im=\r\nagine that this mantra makes energy flow in pingala nadi.\n \nDifferent mantr=\r\nas, when they work, force energy to flow in different subtle channel of ene=\r\nrgy flow in our subtle body, resulting in the perception of a different &quot;ex=\r\nperience&quot; to &quot;self&quot;. Some mantras (e.g. tryambakam yajaamahe) are extremely=\r\n cooling and made energy flow in Ida (Chandra) nadi. Some mantras (e.g. Sav=\r\nitri Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Surya) nadi.\n \nWhen merely some vaay=\r\nu (movement of air) enters a nadi also, there is some experience. When the =\r\nentire energy of self-awareness (aka Kundalini) enters a nadi, it is a very=\r\n powerful experience and one&#39;s perception of self alters drastically.\n \nThe=\r\nre are thousands of nadis in the body and thousands of possible experiences=\r\n. The key is to NOT be distracted by the experience. Mystical experiences a=\r\nre signs of spiritual progress, but they are also traps where we can get st=\r\nuck (i.e. not progress further). Do not think much about the experience. In=\r\n a normal wakeful experience, our senses perceive various objects of the ex=\r\nternal world. We know that all that is just superficial and the reality wit=\r\nhin all of them (i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible to senses. Similarly, whate=\r\nver our inward-directed senses perceive (e.g. vision of a being, sound of a=\r\n mantra, feeling of heat from fire engulfing one etc) in an intense meditat=\r\nion session is ALSO superficial (though perhaps less superficial than the o=\r\nbjects we see in the external world usually) and the reality within those e=\r\nxperiences (i.e. Brahman) is experienced only when you transcend the superf=\r\nicial sense experiences.\n \nWhile it is difficult, the right thing to do whe=\r\nn you feel like you described is to ignore it and keep the intense mental f=\r\nocus on the mantra or on the deity. The good thing is that your experience =\r\nis a sign of spiritual progress and the bad thing is that it can distract y=\r\nou from the final goal.\n \nFeeling hot while and *after* meditation and figh=\r\nting are signs of some diturbation in the pingala nadi. When the correspond=\r\ning karmas are flushed out of the system, things may be fine.\n \nI am not re=\r\nally knowledgeable. With my guru&#39;s blessings, I have experienced some thing=\r\ns and realized some things. Then he told me to not hold back and boldly dec=\r\nlare answers to questions on spirituality and religion as if I just know. I=\r\n just follow his word and do as he said. It is upto my guru and the Mother =\r\nto impregnate my words with meaning as they are received by people. From my=\r\n end, I just type out whatever comes to my mind...\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimh=\r\na\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicast=\r\nro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, November 04, 2008 6:19 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n\n\n        Dear Nalini\n\n        Sorry for =\r\ninterrupting in your question to Narasimha.Your mail reminded me of a simil=\r\nar incident. I have a friend who does very severe japa of a mantra she had =\r\nrecieved in a dream. It was a strange dream where she saw a little girl, na=\r\nked, come and sit on her lap and when she asked teh girl who she (the girl)=\r\n was, the reply came in sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even under=\r\nstand Sanskrit, so she could not understand what the girl was saying. Then =\r\nafter some time the girl in the dream kept repeating what sounded like a ma=\r\nntra in her ears.\n\n        From next day morning my friend started chanting=\r\n that mantra, after about one and half years of chanting recently she did a=\r\n sankalpa for chanting and had experinces similar to the kind u described. =\r\nShe felt her whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. =\r\nHer relation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights etc..=\r\n\n\n        Later after some days it reduced again. I think this maybe a way =\r\nthe karmas are cut off from you. I am not sure of course, Narasimha can tel=\r\nl you better. He much more knowledgeable in  these things.\n\n        -Regard=\r\ns\n         Rajarshi\n\n\n         \n        &quot;This above all: to thine own self =\r\nbe true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n\n        --- On Tue, 4/11/08, nalini swamy &lt;nalini2818@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n          From: nalini swamy &lt;nalini2818@...&gt;\n    =\r\n      Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n          To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Tuesday, 4 November, 2008, 3:5=\r\n8 PM\n\n\n          Dear All,\n          Namaskar.\n\n          Yes, indeed.\n    =\r\n      I had a doubt that I wanted to ask Narasimha garu.

It=\r\n was a strange \n        dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and =\r\nsit on her lap and \n        when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was,=\r\n the reply came in \n        sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even u=\r\nnderstand Sanskrit, so \n        she could not understand what the girl was =\r\nsaying. Then after some time \n        the girl in the dream kept repeating =\r\nwhat sounded like a mantra in her \n        ears.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;From next day morning=\r\n my friend started chanting that mantra, after \n        about one and half =\r\nyears of chanting recently she did a sankalpa for \n        chanting and had=\r\n experinces similar to the kind u described. She felt \n        her whole bo=\r\ndy was internally burning, though there was no fever. Her \n        relation=\r\n with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights \n        etc..&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Later after some days it reduced=\r\n again. I think this maybe a way \n        the karmas are cut off from you. =\r\nI am not sure of course, Narasimha can \n        tell you better.
