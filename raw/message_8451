The \n&gt; knowledge/ignor=\r\nance I keep sharing (because that is the best I can do \n&gt; now) is most like=\r\nly different from what rishis meant. So there is no \n&gt; point in looking up =\r\nto me as a &quot;guru&quot; and following me with fervour. Do \n&gt; your own search inst=\r\nead (and maximize the chance of someone finding \n&gt; truth).\n&gt; \n&gt; When it com=\r\nes to spirituality, I am NOT an enlightened person and not \n&gt; capable of ma=\r\nking anyone enlightened. Even if the un-enlightened \n&gt; spiritual state I am=\r\n in is good enough for someone, I do not know how to \n&gt; replicate it in som=\r\neone, either through writings or talks or thoughts. \n&gt; In other words, I am=\r\n capable of giving one NEITHER what one needs in the \n&gt; long run NOR what I=\r\n have right now. All I can give others, through my \n&gt; writings, is an under=\r\nstanding that is qualified by their and my \n&gt; conditioning (like a white co=\r\nnch exchanged between two people with dirty \n&gt; hands may have the dirty han=\r\nd prints of the giver or the taker). Yes, I \n&gt; can also share knowhow of so=\r\nme tools that may help you in your pursuit, \n&gt; but that does not make me a =\r\nguru either.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not just some humble talk, but the *unquestionabl=\r\ne* and honest \n&gt; reality. It is better if people who are somehow fascinated=\r\n with me \n&gt; and/or look up to me as a guru and think about me with reverenc=\r\ne, divert \n&gt; that attention and reverence towards God. Unlike me, God CAN m=\r\nake you a \n&gt; better astrologer or a better spiritual sadhaka or both.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHappy Guru Pournima again!\n&gt; \n&gt; Love & regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; As=\r\ntrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
