Using divisional charts independe=\r\nnt of\nnatal chart is not correct.\n\nSpirituality is 9H in horoscope. First w=\r\ne need to see if 9H Lord is in\nsustana, then if benefics are in 9H or aspec=\r\nting 9H - if all these are\ngood then spiritual progress is indicated. Then =\r\nwe can use Drigdasa to\ntell person&#39;s spiritual progress\n\nIf natal chart ind=\r\nicates no spiritual progress then using Drigdasa\nindependent of natal chart=\r\n may not be right.\n\nI use your JHora software and it is best in world - I a=\r\nlso have a copy\nof your Vedic astrology book - I respect and admire you - I=\r\n have just\nstated my understanding based on my discussions. \n\nPlease don&#39;t =\r\ntake personally\n\nThanks\nkiran\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasi=\r\nmha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I use drigdasa taug=\r\nht by Maharshi Parasara for timing spiritual \n&gt; progress astrologically. Th=\r\nis dasa applies to all people&#39;s charts.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said earlier, I am a litt=\r\nle hesitant to teach Chandi homam\npublicly, \n&gt; unlike Mahaganapathi homam. =\r\nIf She inspires me in future to do so, I\nmay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandi homam is quite po=\r\nwerful. If one with strong desires performs\nit well \n&gt; for a period of time=\r\n, one can fulfil most desires. Thus, there is\nscope for \n&gt; abuse. Of course=\r\n, the abuse cannot take place unless She wills it.\nIt may be \n&gt; Her will to=\r\n make someone use this in a particular way and some negative \n&gt; karma to be=\r\n generated. However, the law of &quot;equal reaction to\nactions&quot; is \n&gt; unbreakab=\r\nle and one will have to experience the fruits of the karma \n&gt; incurred. To =\r\na self-realized person, no karma sticks and hence no\nfruit of a \n&gt; karma st=\r\nicks. When someone like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana\nMaharshi \n&gt; gets =\r\nthroat cancer for example, they may remain unaffected by it and\nsee the \n&gt; =\r\nsuffering of the body in the same way a physical pleasure is seen. But, \n&gt; =\r\nsomeone who is not there yet and someone who experiences fruits of\ndifferen=\r\nt \n&gt; karmas differently still (instead of looking at them the same way),\nne=\r\neds to \n&gt; be careful in choosing which karmas to undertake and which to avo=\r\nid.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other extreme, if one performs Chandi homam well for a peri=\r\nod\nof time \n&gt; without much desire, She can put one on the fast track and gi=\r\nve a\nhigh level \n&gt; of detachment and very quick spiritual progresss. It can=\r\n sometimes\nbe too \n&gt; quick for the person.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandi is the union of Maha=\r\nkaali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati -\nthree root \n&gt; energies behind the cr=\r\neation, sustenance and destruction of this\nuniverse. \n&gt; She is the primordi=\r\nal energy of this universe.

The 8th house\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lord=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Saturn and Rahu\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on th=\r\ne 8th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; house axis strongly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; speakin=\r\ng. Just keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; kee=\r\np doing your sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vimsamsa. This shows devotion\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12t=\r\nh from atma karaka is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; empty and Mercury owns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Sc=\r\norpio with Rahu. This suggests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that worship of Lord\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishn=\r\nu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nPlease contact suresh.battar@...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Suresh Ba=\r\nttar is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; avail=\r\nable there, he may be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any squar=\r\ne or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; circle shaped vessel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bron=\r\nze but not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; iron) can be used. Good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Regarding books, there are too many. But direct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experience through\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surrender to th=\r\ne Lord,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects\n&gt; &gt;&gt; our se=\r\nnses perceive in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; the Lord and that we are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our =\r\nown\n&gt; &gt;&gt; impurity. If we keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our=\r\n mind is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; overly attracted to or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itsel=\r\nf is a very useful\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhana. In addition, if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you spend a considera=\r\nble time everyday in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation, that too helps.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For you, I =\r\nstrongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; commentary on BhagavadGita by\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unique saint, wh=\r\no is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dwaitic and a=\r\ndwaitic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coming=\r\n from knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; writings coming from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience=\r\n. More\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than 700 years ago,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in A=\r\nlandi in his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical body at the age\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of 21 years and still medit=\r\nating there. I have NOT\n&gt; &gt;&gt; read a more competent or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sublime commenta=\r\nry on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; quite an inspired work. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; good En=\r\nglish translation of this work is available\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu\n&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophy in =\r\nmy opinion.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; c=\r\nome with him to forest,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; presence of Maharshi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many oth=\r\ner learned\n&gt; &gt;&gt; people, Maharshi Vasishtha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all=\r\n Upanishats to Rama. His\n&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings were captured\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by Valmiki and t=\r\nhe work is known as &quot;Yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vaasishtham&quot;.

And\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you people have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out=\r\n the right path at many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; times but now i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; brought me =\r\nhere( and to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n the thread where\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sani and now i have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I ha=\r\nve learned a little bit of astrology from this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thread and from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nother  sources but with that i can not really make\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any decisions of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there are many\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; group so if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\nomeone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chart and guide me i\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given\n&gt; &gt;&gt; below:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place-=\r\n Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i ha=\r\nve been reading\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here an=\r\nd there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and doing some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I=\r\n have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; really seen and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but al=\r\nl this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was random and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage whe=\r\nre i feel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that my spiritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of a=\r\nll i am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thinking of reading more to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i ha=\r\nve no idea what to read\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and from where to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Homam on a r=\r\negular\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; except t=\r\nhe homa kundam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n can anyone tell me\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the ground.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i=\r\n want to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ask but if someone\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would=\r\n be very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thankful to him and i will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
