Keep doing it as regularly as you can. It can only purify your consciousness further and further as you do it more and more.\n \nAs far as &quot;experiences&quot; are concerned, different people will have different experiences. Some people with more intuitive and imaginative minds may have visions. Some people with more logical and rational minds may experience a clarity of mind. But, overall, anyone doing homam on a regular basis will start to love fire, identify with fire, experience some kind of calmness, bliss and vitality when with fire. The specific experiences and visions are not worth bothering much about.\n \nOne person driving a hillside road may see beautiful scenery on the way. He may be charmed by it, keep watching, get stuck there and not reach the top of the hill. Another person driving the road on the other side of the hill may not see any scenery, but keep driving and reach the top of the hill and enjoy a perfect view of everything from there.\n \nSimilarly, someone having visions and experiences may become either egoistic or attached and get stuck. Someone having no experiences whatsoever may keep doing sadhana and oneday become self-realized.\n \nLike a mother serves each child what is good for him/her, Devi can give experiences to some people in order to reinforce their faith. But pay little attention to such experiences and keep doing sadhana. THAT is the key.\n \nHari&#39;s words are wise. It is a good idea to keep one&#39;s experiences to oneself. Of course, as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said on another occasion, one having climbed a wall and seen a beautiful heavenly place on the other hand, may want to come back and tell others about it. If everyone who climbs the wall jumps on the other side and settles down there, how will other people know about it? So some people need to do that job (of coming back into the village and telling people). But realize that one who does that job stands the chance of getting stuck and never going back there. Secondly, one should consider talking about one&#39;s experiences to others only after making some progress. Third, one should ensure that none of one&#39;s experiences cause pride in some way or the other.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Girish,\n&gt; \n&gt; Congratulations on your first Chandi Homam. May SHE bless you in your\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Ramakrishna used to often advise that sadhana should be done in\n&gt; private. He meant that the sadhana should be kept away from the glare of\n&gt; other persons and after the person has attained a certain stage of\n&gt; realization, he can then talk about his sadhana to other people.\n&gt; \n&gt; For every one experience of Narasimha, there are probably 10 or 20 such\n&gt; episodes he has not narrated in public forums. For one Manikarnika ghat\n&gt; experience of Manish, there are probably 10 such experiences we have not\n&gt; heard about him.\n&gt; \n&gt; So bottomline is dont worry or get carried away by your experiences. As\n&gt; Narasimha emphasizes often, faith, sincerity are the keys to achieving\n&gt; progress. Keep your head level and continue in your sadhana. Ultimately GOD\n&gt; will come and talk with you....thats strictly between you and HIM/HER.\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Mar 22, 2010 at 12:42 PM, Girish &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaskarams Narasimhaji and other Masters ,\n&gt; &gt; I finished my &quot;first&quot; Chandi Homam yesterday and I should say that it was\n&gt; &gt; an overwhelming exprience. I intended to do the 13 chapters end to end but\n&gt; &gt; had to restrict my self to the 1st,4th,5th and the 11th Chapters primarly\n&gt; &gt; because the homam was generating lot of smoke and I had a few occassions in\n&gt; &gt; the past where there were complains raised by neighbours regarding the\n&gt; &gt; smoke. I used different 5 different kinds of fruits along with flattened\n&gt; &gt; rice, puffed rice , raisins and dried cocunuts. Next time onwards I plan to\n&gt; &gt; stick to only dried cocunuts and a few other dry items so that the smoke can\n&gt; &gt; be restricted.\n&gt; &gt; While meditating I saw flashes of violet colour and I kept seeing the\n&gt; &gt; images of the devi&#39;s face (a rather serious one at that ) constantly\n&gt; &gt; munching on something. The very thought that Chandi was in the fire in the\n&gt; &gt; homa kundam gave me goose pimples all over and I was thinking again and\n&gt; &gt; again whether I am doing enough to give my best to her. In the end I felt as\n&gt; &gt; if the divine mother was consoling me telling that its OK not to be 100%\n&gt; &gt; perfect but atleast you tried. With the Ganapathi Homam I feel as if Ganesha\n&gt; &gt; is someone who plays around with you just like a child and so do you with\n&gt; &gt; him. But with Chandi I felt as if I was talking to someone very mature and I\n&gt; &gt; felt like a complete idiot not knowing what to do next and stumbling at\n&gt; &gt; every step.\n&gt; &gt; Not sure whether this is how everyone else feels as well. I would like to\n&gt; &gt; know the feelings of the other masters in this group regarding their first\n&gt; &gt; Chandi homam experience.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Girish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
