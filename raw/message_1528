I thought the entire homam can be done with =\r\nout making sound if we can do it. Once you get the mantra, it is much easie=\r\nr when we pronounce it loud. It takes much more effort to pronounce it comp=\r\nletely mentally while keeping the correct swara.\n\nThere were times when man=\r\ny of the mantras were secret (one may recall the story of Ramanuja giving o=\r\nut Om Namoe Narayanaaya to all. It was kept a secret for a long time).\n\nAll=\r\n the mantras are making our conversation with the gods during the mantra. T=\r\nhe communication with Gods is at thought level and physical plane is not re=\r\nquired.\n\nIn fact, if ones internal fire is very strong, then even physical =\r\nfire may not be really required. How ever, the internal fire in most of us =\r\nis perhaps very weak.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ravi Poruri &lt;rporuri@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;   =\r\n    The general rule is that any mantra chanting during a homam should be\n&gt;=\r\n loud, atleast there should be little sound. However, this rule\n&gt; does not =\r\napply to Gayatri Mantra.\n&gt;       You can chant Gayatri mantra while offerin=\r\ngs are made in any Homam, Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Srikrishna etc, but in min=\r\nd only. You can infact do a seperate homa for Savitru Gayatri consisting en=\r\ntirely of Gayatra Mantra. \n&gt;       When you offer naivedyam, when you do pr=\r\naanayama etc also, do it mentally.
