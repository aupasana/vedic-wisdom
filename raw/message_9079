Shakti is the sum total of all the=\r\n beings with various agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing va=\r\nrious karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; Tho=\r\nugh each karma should give karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that re=\r\nquires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another being. So this re=\r\nquires a complicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Con=\r\nsciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the =\r\n*sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a =\r\n&quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferabl=\r\ny experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool w=\r\nhich may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and o=\r\nrdered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequenc=\r\ning of all beings.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; The assignment and ordering of these =\r\npools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new actions a=\r\nnd adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilit=\r\nies in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and he=\r\nnce the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n *\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; As one engages in remedial measures such as prayers, =\r\nfasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulner=\r\nabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including planets=\r\n, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who ope=\r\nrate through other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). The kar=\r\nma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be dow=\r\nngraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. Or, s=\r\nome desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in order=\r\n within the same pool.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, w=\r\nith sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thing can=\r\n happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Ever=\r\ny action by one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange=\r\n one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a=\r\n karma that was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; However, remember that the remedial measure has to be a=\r\ns intense as the karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a smal=\r\nl rock with small force, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a=\r\n hill.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool t=\r\nhat can give a specific result, nobody can make one experience that result,=\r\n no matter what ritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of ne=\r\ngative karmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of pos=\r\nitive karmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses an=\r\nd blessings can often make some difference.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; This point i=\r\ns well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his=\r\n point (3).\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mist=\r\nakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards th=\r\nose who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the=\r\n play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impart=\r\nially and impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this pla=\r\ny of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest =\r\nof evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced=\r\n delivery of fruits to actions using available agents.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and will giv=\r\ne their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some ef=\r\nfort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is to n=\r\not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish act=\r\nions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and selfl=\r\ness actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are good k=\r\narmas.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pi=\r\npeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current =\r\naction, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastra=\r\ns, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One th=\r\ning is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commens=\r\nurate with the karma itself.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; You need only small force t=\r\no push a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt; Astrology &=\r\n Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; &gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, Februar=\r\ny 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=82=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When a king=\r\ndom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by the courtiers t=\r\no randomly pick the next king.

The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king.=\r\n The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king.

Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind,=\r\n and are actually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a cert=\r\nain amount of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usuall=\r\ny make an assumption. We assume that there is a person, and separate from t=\r\nhe person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from t=\r\nime to time. We then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas f=\r\nrom our karmic pipeline.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39;=\r\n and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing b=\r\nut your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas=\r\n are your karmas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have =\r\nchanged your karma.

I will add my 2 cents.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;\n *=C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;The cosmos runs based on the fundamental law that each action (kar=\r\nma) gives a reaction/result (karmaphala) commensurate with it. Shakti is th=\r\ne sum total of all the beings with various agendas engaging in various karm=\r\nas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphala that =\r\nis commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala=\r\n, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part =\r\nof Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very co=\r\nmplicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of =\r\nagents for their delivery.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At any tim=\r\ne, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala =\r\nin this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in t=\r\nhis life&quot; pool and the rest in\n the third pool which may not be experienced=\r\n anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is ba=\r\nsed on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The assignment and ordering of these pools will consta=\r\nntly undergo churn as one engages in various new actions and adds them to t=\r\nhe pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of k=\r\narmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and hence the pools may=\r\n be re-arranged.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As one engages in remedial measures such as praye=\r\nrs, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vu=\r\nlnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including pla=\r\nnets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who=\r\n operate through\n other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). Th=\r\ne karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may b=\r\ne downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. =\r\nOr, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in =\r\norder within the same pool.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;When someone curses or bles=\r\nses one, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same=\r\n thing can happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik p=\r\nools. Every action by one, or even people around one, has the potential to =\r\nre-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be post=\r\nponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanc=\r\ned sooner.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, remember that the remedial=\r\n measure has to be as intense as the karma that it is trying to manipulate.=\r\n You can move a small rock with small force, but you need a large force to =\r\nmove a big rock or\n a hill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If there =\r\nis no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific result, nobody =\r\ncan make one experience that result, no matter what ritual one does. Howeve=\r\nr, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their optional pool an=\r\nd even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their optional pool, an=\r\nd hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make some differe=\r\nnce.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Gu=\r\nru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one =\r\nthinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. =\r\nGod is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those who =\r\npraise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of=\r\n actions and\n fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially a=\r\nnd impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of ac=\r\ntions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil=\r\n persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced delive=\r\nry of fruits to actions using available agents.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and will =\r\ngive their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some=\r\n effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is t=\r\no not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish =\r\nactions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and se=\r\nlfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are goo=\r\nd karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pr=\r\ne-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort=\r\n and current\n action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are availa=\r\nble in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each =\r\naction. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has=\r\n to be commensurate with the karma itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You=\r\n need only small force to push a cat out of your way, but need a large forc=\r\ne to push an elephant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astrology &amp; Spirituality Res=\r\nources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nSent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013\n 11:29 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=82&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by the=\r\n courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a begg=\r\nar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is =\r\nthe karma of the ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) This is the=\r\n karma of the beggar turned king.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Eve=\r\nrything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s=\r\n karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s ka=\r\nrma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens=\r\n&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The\n sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse=\r\n, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit o=\r\nf mankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the day, some people w=\r\nith a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti throu=\r\ngh speech.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to people an=\r\nd their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that ther=\r\ne is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These karm=\r\nas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone to come=\r\n and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are =\r\nthe same thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impr=\r\nessions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, yo=\r\nu have changed your karma. Or\n course, that is easier said than done.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is=\r\n a blessing.
