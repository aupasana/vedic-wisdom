It is irrelevant to the topic at h=\r\nand and to the charter of this yahoogroup. I will ignore your comments.\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \n&gt; Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you br=\r\ning\n&gt; in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n \nTHIS is the problem. Knowled=\r\nge of rishis does not exist in disconnected islands, though people of today=\r\n refuse to see the big picture and have a holistic approach.\n \nAs I said, V=\r\nasishtha said in Yoga Vaasistham (BTW, answer to your question to Rajarshi:=\r\n Yoga vaasishtham was Valmiki&#39;s record of Vasisitha&#39;s teachings to Rama) th=\r\nat the bird of individualized consciousness flies to the sky of enlightenme=\r\nnt using the two wings of knowledge and action.\n \nKnowledge here does not r=\r\nefer to the knowhow of rituals etc. It refers to the knowledge of Self that=\r\n is expounded in Veda and Upanishads.\n \nOne continuously walking on a hilly=\r\n path without the knowledge that reaching the pinnacle is the final goal ma=\r\ny walk for ever, go in circles around the hill and not reach the pinnacle. =\r\nOne who knows that reaching the pinnacle is the goal and keeps staring at i=\r\nt and remains seated at the base will remain there and not reach the pinnac=\r\nle.\n \nSimilarly, one who keeps performing rituals without understanding phi=\r\nlosophy and the essence of Veda and Upanishads, will keep performing ritual=\r\ns and not reach god. One who keeps repeating &quot;all is god, all god&quot; and does=\r\n no rituals (or other actions) will also not reach god.\n \nPhilosophy and ri=\r\ntuals are not independent. Philosophy should motivate our thinking as we pe=\r\nrform rituals.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; panihomam. Even the fire is not pr=\r\nesent there. It is\n&gt; based on a dictum called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste\n=\r\n&gt; hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right\n&gt; hand of the brahmi=\r\nn. It is believed that agni is ever\n&gt; present in the right hand of the srot=\r\nriya (one learned\n&gt; in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here. It is as=\r\n\n&gt; per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can\n&gt; be perfromed =\r\non the right glove worn by a brahmin, then\n&gt; the problem arises.\n \nWhat is =\r\n&quot;learned in the veda&quot;? If a person can recite Veda perfectly and yet Vedic =\r\nessence does not guide one&#39;s understanding, attitude, thoughts and actions,=\r\n will performing homam on the right palm of that person without explicit fi=\r\nre work?\n \nThe emphasis on external things and dry scholarship has corrupte=\r\nd a lot of our understanding and is the reason for the sorry state of Veda =\r\ndharma in today&#39;s world. Dry scholarship and literal meanings are preferred=\r\n to internal experience. Imperfect is taken for perfect as it adheres to th=\r\ne letter though not spirit, while things adhering to the spirit though not =\r\nthe letter may sometimes be labeled imperfect, defective and impure.\n \nWhat=\r\n we need is people who may or may not be able to recite Veda and yet imbibe=\r\n the essence of Vedic teaching deeply in their understanding, attitude, tho=\r\nughts and actions. What we need is people who have realized god within them=\r\nselves and are guided by the bright inner light. What we need is people who=\r\n are like walking fire.\n \n*        *        *\n \nManish wrote on this topic =\r\nto me:\n \n&gt; Dear Narasimha and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultimately the proof of the pudd=\r\ning lies in the eating.\n&gt; Yajnas are complex procedures with elaborate rule=\r\ns. We are not teaching\n&gt; Yajnas.\n&gt; Effectively what we are teaching is a me=\r\nthod of sadhana which gives\n&gt; realisation of the self and a method to exper=\r\nience the Devatas within one&#39;s\n&gt; own body. If I had not experienced Her wit=\r\nhin myself, then I could not have\n&gt; come up with this idea, which She gave =\r\nme.\n&gt; Kundalini Shakti rising in Sushumna (channel of Fire) is the basis of=\r\n all\n&gt; spiritual experience. It produces men of God.\n&gt; This method gives a =\r\nway for identification of individual Shakti and\n&gt; consciousness which is li=\r\nmited,..... with Her who is divine and Unlimited.\n&gt; This path of homam will=\r\n resurrect the entire original Veda dharma. This was\n&gt; shown to me by Her.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards\n&gt; Manish\n \n*        *        *\n \nYou wrote: &quot;There are so=\r\n many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objects. If you call=\r\n something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the vedic tenets.&quot;\n =\r\n\nYou also asked: &quot;Please clarify whether the homa procedure taught by you b=\r\nelongs to the vedic system.&quot;\n \nTwo deductions:\n \n(1) It is unclear to you f=\r\nrom my manual whether I claim my procedure to belong to &quot;Vedic system&quot; or n=\r\not. After all, I did not label it &quot;Vedic&quot; anywhere in the manual.\n(2) You d=\r\no not object to teaching any method as long as I do not call it &quot;Vedic&quot;.\n \n=\r\nWhy are we having a long discussion and argument then?! :-)\n \n*        *   =\r\n     *\n \n&gt; Sir, honestly, have you ever read the vedas to know what\n&gt; is in=\r\nside them? or for that matter the Sayana bhashya.\n \nI have read only some p=\r\narts, tried to understand myself using my knowledge of Sanskrit and also go=\r\nne through multiple commentaries. But that was sufficient for me realize th=\r\nat what we have is very superficial. What I read in commentaries seemed sup=\r\nerficial to me and what I could independently come up with, based on my San=\r\nskrit scholarship, was also always superficial. Sometimes, as I meditated o=\r\nn a verse for a few days, a different understanding might descend on me, wh=\r\nich would seem deeper and make more sense. An example can be seen in messag=\r\ne 4436 at\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4436\n \nIt ti=\r\nes in yogic/tantric concepts to the Vedic verse, just as alluded by Vivekan=\r\nanda (see the other mail I sent today).\n \nI refuse to accept different syst=\r\nems like Vedic system, tantric system, adwaita, dwaita, ritualism, philosop=\r\nhy etc. To me, there is just one system - sanatana dharma or Veda dharma - =\r\ntaught by rishis. In their inability to understand it holistically, people =\r\ncreated disconnected islands of knowledge. But I reckon the time has come t=\r\no embrace a holistic approach and restore true Veda dharma.\n \nBest regards,=\r\n\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n              =\r\n    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http:=\r\n//SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- S=\r\nindhu Saraswathi &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Thanks for your reply.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. &quot;There are many standard homam procedur=\r\nes in the world today, some more elaborate than what we teach and some more=\r\n brief. &quot; - \n&gt;  \n&gt; Please clarify whether the homa procedure taught by you =\r\nbelongs to the vedic system.

It is called panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is b=\r\nased on a dictum called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa i=\r\ns to be performed on the right hand of the brahmin.

On the contrary, if you need the san=\r\nction of vedic authority for it, please answer within the ambit of vedic kn=\r\nowledge if doubts are raised.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The apprehension is that in the year 20=\r\n00 you said,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressin=\r\ng my deep gratitude for my \n&gt; guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant=\r\n source of enlightenment, \n&gt; encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally =\r\ngrateful to him&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; and now you say\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;In my well-considered view, S=\r\nanjay ji got some specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may b=\r\ne imperfect, like with all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read =\r\nsome books and formed his understanding. As he started teaching it, he rece=\r\nived a lot of adulation for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got add=\r\nicted to the adulation and started to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after=\r\n the initial run. Slowly he became commercial and he started selling manufa=\r\nctured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, his teachings contain fascinating =\r\nphilosophization, which is really superficial and does not stand any real s=\r\ncrutiny. His theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of ca=\r\nrds. Sanjay ji always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach late=\r\nr&quot;. It is convenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything=\r\n does not make sense, it could be because you have to learn more!\n&gt;  \n&gt; As =\r\nhe started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived know=\r\nledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to the commercializat=\r\nion and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations privately and having n=\r\no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After sev=\r\neral clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.\n&gt;  \n&gt; With basic concepts like house=\r\ns, arudha padas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he rece=\r\nived are imperfect. He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his te=\r\nachings do not work consistently.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is mad=\r\ne of some specific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines=\r\n (that are imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he ha=\r\nstily created a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything =\r\nin his teachings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; In =\r\n2000 you said\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a ph=\r\nalita dasa. It shows general\n&gt; results. Narayana dasa is computed different=\r\nly for different divisional charts and we\n&gt; can use Narayana dasa of a divi=\r\nsional chart to predict matters related to that\n&gt; divisional chart.\n&gt;  \n&gt; N=\r\narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As=\r\n one dasa ends\n&gt; and another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed la=\r\ngna and another rasi\n&gt; becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the pr=\r\nogressed lagna as the reference, we\n&gt; find out the events that happen in th=\r\nat dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each\n&gt; person, with each chart appli=\r\ncable in one dasa.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is a very versatile dasa system and readers s=\r\nould pay attention to the details of\n&gt; calculation.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; now you say\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa may be based on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it d=\r\noes not work with any level of consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; You seem to start teaching even before you start learning. I&#39; m on=\r\nly afraid it should not happen in the context of vedic rituals also. From t=\r\nhe pronunciation  of the person who is performing the homam in the video, i=\r\nt is quite obvious that he is at an entry level.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you agree that yo=\r\nu are not trying to propagate vedic knowledge, I have no more points  to ma=\r\nke.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Are there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depe=\r\nnding on what he knows and what he does ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. &quot;Knowledge of *external =\r\nrituals* is relative and can never be absolute.

Th=\r\nere are many standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elabor=\r\nate than what we teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what proc=\r\nedure one uses and I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regula=\r\nrly*, irrespective of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedu=\r\nre for those who do not know any. If you are initiated into a different pro=\r\ncedure that you can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you k=\r\nnow it. That will make us very happy. However, if the method you know canno=\r\nt be done daily, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to d=\r\no daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one s=\r\nhould serve lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, f=\r\norks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order t=\r\no serve various items in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so compl=\r\nex that one cannot do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once =\r\nevery few months.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that better or is it better to relax the rules an=\r\nd protocols to make it less formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in i=\r\nts own purity.\n&gt; &gt; Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty =\r\nhelp to preserve\n&gt; &gt; knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only knowledge that sh=\r\nould (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absolu=\r\nte*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute knowled=\r\nge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absol=\r\nute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corr=\r\nupt about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the day, the key is whether one is actuall=\r\ny doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is causing inter=\r\nnal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s spiritual p=\r\nrogress or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me cut & paste a section from a writeup=\r\n I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given earlier and=\r\n addresses some relevant issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; Do Ve=\r\ndas Describe External Rituals\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people believe that Veda describes =\r\nthe specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolut=\r\ne, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra.=\r\n How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-kaala=\r\n-paatra?\n&gt; \n&gt; Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVed=\r\na is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=\r\n=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolu=\r\nte truths about the inner self and not relative truths about external matte=\r\nrs. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal=\r\n in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and purif=\r\ny all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offe=\r\nrings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the=\r\n smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Metaphor: Vedic =\r\nHomam vs Aagamic Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanction=\r\ned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by =\r\nVeda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once there were many =\r\npeople who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and e=\r\nnjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]=\r\n. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n&gt; \n&gt; As people =\r\nstarted living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someo=\r\nne had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, =\r\n&quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People fai=\r\nthfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n&gt; \n&gt; People started moving fur=\r\nther and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert far away =\r\nfrom the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake, l=\r\net alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards eas=\r\nt, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one=\r\n mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. =\r\nSome walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some inter=\r\nesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then came s=\r\nome great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of walkin=\r\ng and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea=\r\n after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea, w=\r\nhich included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n&gt; \n&gt; People perfo=\r\nrming the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing =\r\nis not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different from th=\r\ne &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even under=\r\nstand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they s=\r\nimply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they=\r\n were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructions =\r\nwere meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instructions came=\r\n from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived =\r\nand how to get to the sea from there!\n&gt; \n&gt; Slowly many new sets of instruct=\r\nions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to the s=\r\nea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk towards east [e=\r\nvolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].\n&gt; \n&gt; One particular path through jungle=\r\ns was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of =\r\nsex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through t=\r\nhat jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest co=\r\nuld make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in=\r\n a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were =\r\nkilled. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condemn=\r\ned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even=\r\n people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desiste=\r\nd from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As time progressed, people started fighting too much about =\r\nwhose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the o=\r\nriginal instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-cal=\r\nled &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed t=\r\nimes. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not re=\r\nach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal=\r\n of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the =\r\ninstructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geogr=\r\naphical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to =\r\nsea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for vi=\r\nolating tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief s=\r\nummary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as A=\r\ngni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different as=\r\npects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realiz=\r\nation. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied sub=\r\njects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definiti=\r\nve and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-realizat=\r\nion itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only r=\r\nelative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends=\r\n on one&#39;s current position!\n&gt; \n&gt; Great men in many spiritual paths, within =\r\nHinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood=\r\n the current state of people around them and gave specific instructions on =\r\nhow to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructi=\r\nons and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradi=\r\nctions between paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; As the metaphor=\r\n above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distra=\r\ncting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does =\r\na Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues =\r\nare whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s fo=\r\ncus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as =\r\na twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy =\r\nto one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six=\r\n months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursui=\r\nts. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more =\r\nenergy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to on=\r\ne=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wise Tradeoffs\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose the presi=\r\ndent of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can =\r\ninvite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the=\r\n room individually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long=\r\n pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose one is =\r\nin a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 assoc=\r\niates by name and seats them in the room individually following the protoco=\r\nl and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, =\r\nis it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates toge=\r\nther and seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time to =\r\nlet the President eat in peace?\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges=\r\n long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut sho=\r\nrt on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a fire ritual, ma=\r\nking offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas don=\r\ne to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various prelimin=\r\nary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one=\r\n has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in script=\r\nures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise trade=\r\noffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;s=\r\nections deleted&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Proof of the Pudding\n&gt; \n&gt; At this time, more than hun=\r\ndred people are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spendin=\r\ng time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an at=\r\ntitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual understanding of the a=\r\nbsolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to =\r\none=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it=\r\n. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see fo=\r\nr oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and cla=\r\nrity of thinking.\n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;=\r\n ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ya=\r\nhoo.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Ra=\r\njarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHor=\r\na in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. =\r\nI humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing these topic=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaj=\r\ni and the video of a homam being performed and have the following observati=\r\nons to make.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras =\r\nwhich describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can o=\r\nnly be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajna=\r\ns).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam p=\r\nrocedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there)=\r\n. We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not essential. T=\r\nhey are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. Th=\r\nere are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba =\r\nsutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4.=\r\n The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy =\r\nof divine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. The=\r\nn only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; =\r\nas named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to =\r\nget a insight into the importance of these steps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. The procedure=\r\n in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large dev=\r\niations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is=\r\n a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked und=\r\ner the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7. The direction for sprinkli=\r\nng water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4=\r\n is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasav=\r\nya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and endin=\r\ng at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keeping th=\r\ne vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 9=\r\n.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is mi=\r\nssing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojana=\r\nm and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1=\r\n2. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 13. Ajy=\r\na samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dra=\r\nvya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purificatio=\r\nn of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (=\r\nsruksruvou).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in th=\r\ne agni iis missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a single=\r\n dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is=\r\n fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead t=\r\no dravyalopa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and many more ............\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. Strictly spe=\r\naking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alon=\r\ne exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vaha=\r\nka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries=\r\n the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gau=\r\nnam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the=\r\n deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni=\r\n of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) b=\r\ny offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 19. Very good a=\r\nlternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra m=\r\naharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras s=\r\no that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras=\r\n. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on th=\r\neir own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can=\r\n be learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practi=\r\nce with devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest that we =\r\npreserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always=\r\n yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n\n\n"}}
