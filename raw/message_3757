The frightened devotees beat upon their plates and drums to drive her\naw=\r\nay. But she quenched her thirst unconcerned and then went on her way with\na=\r\n roar. Ramana said astonished,=E2=80=9CWhy do you worry so much? The leopar=\r\nd\nintimated to me by the first roar that she was coming here. After drinkin=\r\ng\nwater she told me by another roar that she was going. She went her own wa=\r\ny.She\nnever meddled with your affairs. Why are you so scared? This mountain=\r\n is the\nhome of these wild animals, and we are their guests. That being so,=\r\n is it\nright on your part to drive them away?=E2=80=9D\n\nRamana was equally =\r\nfearless with regard to scorpions. Vasudeva Sastri\nrecounts, =E2=80=9COne d=\r\nay, when we were at Skandashram, I was aghast to find a\nscorpion climbing u=\r\np over Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body in the front and another at the\nsame time cl=\r\nimbing down his back. I was terrified and wanted to do\nsomething. But Bhaga=\r\nvan remained calm, as if nothing happened, and the two\nscorpions, after cra=\r\nwling over his body as if over a wall, eventually left\nhim. After they left=\r\n,Bhagavan explained to us, =E2=80=98They crawl over you just as\nthey would =\r\ncrawl on the floor or a wall or tree. Do they crawl over\nthese,stinging as =\r\nthey go? It is only because you fear them and do\nsomething,that they fear y=\r\nou and do something in return=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D\n\nHowever, in so far as con=\r\ncerns insects which were a nuisance to people, Sri\nRamana did not object to=\r\n killing them. When once a whole army of black ants\ninvaded the Hall throug=\r\nh the water drain,he told Annamalai Swami to detect\nwhere they were coming =\r\nfrom and to put an end to it. The hole was cemented\nover without further ad=\r\no. He also used to pluck blood-sucking insects out of\nthe coats of the dogs=\r\n and throw them into the gleaming coals. Similarly he\ndid not object if dev=\r\notees killed mosquitoes or used insecticide in the\ncowshed.\n\nMaharshi had t=\r\nhe same compassionate attitude towards plants as towards\nanimals. One day w=\r\norkers had been deputed to gather mangoes from one of the\ntrees. But instea=\r\nd of climbing up the tree and picking them one by one, they\nknocked them do=\r\nwn with\nsticks. In this way a large number of leaves were knocked down alon=\r\ng with\nthe fruit. Ramana, who was as usual sitting in the Hall,heard the be=\r\nating\nand sent a message via his attendants that it should stop at once. Wh=\r\nen he\nlater passed by the tree and saw the mango leaves in heaps on the flo=\r\nor, he\ncried out harshly, =E2=80=9CIn return for giving us fruit, is the tr=\r\nee to be beaten\nwith sticks? Who gave you this work? Instead of beating the=\r\n tree, you might\nas well cut it to the roots. You need not gather the fruit=\r\n. Go away!=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen one of the attendants beat the monkeys, because t=\r\nhey had stolen nuts,\nBhagavan rebuked him, =E2=80=9CYou are not beating the=\r\n monkeys, you are beating me.\nThe pain is mine.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe monkeys often=\r\n stole the fruit which devotees had brought as a food\noffering, if the latt=\r\ner were not careful or were meditating.One of the\nattendants was entrusted =\r\nwith the task of receiving the fruit from the\nvisitors. One day he was sitt=\r\ning with eyes closed, a basket full of fruit at\nhis side, listening to the =\r\nradio. In the mean\ntime the monkeys were freely helping themselves to the c=\r\nontents of the\nbasket. When people in the Hall tried to chase the monkeys a=\r\nway, Ramana\njoked, =E2=80=9CWhen these attendants are immersed in deep medi=\r\ntation, the monkeys\ncome and see to the work of the attendants. Someone has=\r\n to look after the\nwork! The attendants put the fruit into the basket, the =\r\nmonkeys put the\nfruit into their stomachs; that is all the difference. Whil=\r\ne people forget\nthemselves while listening to the music over the radio the =\r\nmonkeys busy\nthemselves in enjoying the sweet juice of the fruit. That is g=\r\nood, isn=E2=80=99t\nit!=E2=80=9D\n\nThe monkey mothers liked to come with thei=\r\nr babies, to show them to Ramana\nfull of pride. Suri Nagamma reports, =E2=\r\n=80=9CYesterday a monkey with her baby stood\nin the window by the side of B=\r\nhagavan=E2=80=99s sofa. Bhagavan was reading something\nand so did not notic=\r\ne\nit. After a while, the monkey screeched and one of the attendants tried t=\r\no\ndrive her away by shouting, but she would not go.Bhagavan then looked up =\r\nand\nsaid, =E2=80=98Wait! She has come here to show her baby to Bhagavan; do=\r\n not all the\npeople bring their children to show them? For her, her child i=\r\ns equally\ndear. Look how young that child is.=E2=80=99 So saying, Bhagavan =\r\nturned towards her,\nand said in an endearing tone, =E2=80=98Hullo! So you h=\r\nave brought your child? That\nis good!=E2=80=99 And, giving her a plantain, =\r\nhe sent her away.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Ramana felt a deep admiration for the monke=\r\ny tribes and was convinced\nthat tapas was not unknown to them. Once he said=\r\n, =E2=80=9CI have known something\nabout their organisation, their kings, la=\r\nws,regulations. Everything is so\nperfect and well-organised. So much intell=\r\nigence behind it all. I even know\nthat tapas is not unknown to monkeys. A m=\r\nonkey whom we used to call\n=E2=80=98Mottaipaiyan=E2=80=99 was once oppresse=\r\nd and ill-treated by a gang. He went away\ninto the forest for a few days, d=\r\nid tapas, acquired strength and returned.\n\nWhen he came and sat on a bough =\r\nand shook it, all the rest of the monkeys,\nwho had previously ill-treated h=\r\nim and of whom he was previously mortally\nafraid, were now quaking before h=\r\nim. Yes, I am clear that tapas is well\nknown to monkeys.=E2=80=9D\n\nOne day =\r\nwhen Ramana inadvertently bumped against a sparrow=E2=80=99s nest, an egg\nf=\r\nell out and cracked. He was dismayed and cried out to his attendant\nMadhava=\r\n, =E2=80=9CLook, look what I have done today! Oh,the poor mother will be so=\r\n\nsorrow-stricken, perhaps angry with me also, at my causing the destruction=\r\n\nof her expected little one! Can the cracked eggshell be pieced together\nag=\r\nain? Let us try!=E2=80=9D\n\nSo saying he took a piece of wet cloth, wrapped =\r\nit around the broken egg and\nlaid it back into its nest. Each third hour he=\r\n took it out again, removed\nthe cloth, took it in his hand and glanced at i=\r\nt for a few minutes. Seven\ndays later, after taking the egg from its nest, =\r\nhe announced with the\nastonishment of a schoolboy, =E2=80=9CLook what a\nwon=\r\nder! The crack has closed.=E2=80=9D Some days later he found the egg hatche=\r\nd out,\nthe little bird had come out. With a face beaming with joy he took t=\r\nhe\nnestling into his hand, stroked and caressed it and handed it to the oth=\r\ners,\nthat they could also admire it.\n\nOne day some new born squirrels had f=\r\nallen out of their nest and landed on\nRamana=E2=80=99s couch. Their eyes we=\r\nre still closed and they were very tiny. The\nmother, however, did not take =\r\nthem back. But how should one feed such tiny\nthings? The squirrels laid in =\r\nRamana=E2=80=99s palm. His face was glowing with love\nand affection towards=\r\n them. The devotees looked on helplessly, but he was\nhappy and cheerful. He=\r\n asked for some cotton and made a soft bed for\nthem.Then he took a piece of=\r\n the cotton, rolled it up so that the end looked\nlike a sharp needle, dippe=\r\nd it into some milk and trickled it in their tiny\nmouths. This he did repea=\r\ntedly. He looked after them with great care and\nlove until they grew up and=\r\n started running around. They did not run away,\nhowever, but always ran aro=\r\nund their =E2=80=98mother=E2=80=99.\n\nSomething similar happened, when a cat=\r\n ate the mother of some young\nsquirrels. Again Ramana took on the task of c=\r\naring for the young. As he\nliked to use daily events to teach his devotees =\r\nhe said to them, =E2=80=9CThese\nlittle ones do not know that wisdom lies in=\r\n remaining in their nest. They\nkeep attempting to come out. All trouble lie=\r\ns outside but they cannot remain\nwithin. Similarly if the mind is not exter=\r\nnalised, but remains sunk in the\nHeart then there would only be happiness. =\r\nBut the mind keeps moving out.=E2=80=9D\nWhen Rangaswami asked, =E2=80=9CWha=\r\nt is the path for keeping it inward?=E2=80=9D, Bhagavan\nsaid, =E2=80=9CIt i=\r\ns exactly the same as what I am doing now. Each time a young\nsquirrel comes=\r\n out, I keep putting it back into its nest. When I go on doing\nit, it learn=\r\ns the happiness of staying in the nest.=E2=80=9D\n\nShantamma reports, =E2=80=\r\n=9COnce Lakshmi came into the Hall. She was pregnant at\nthat time. It was a=\r\nfter lunch time, when Bhagavan was reading the\nnewspapers. Lakshmi came nea=\r\nr and started licking the papers. Bhagavan\nlooked up and said: =E2=80=98Wai=\r\nt a little, Lakshmi.=E2=80=99 But Lakshmi went on licking.\nBhagavan laid hi=\r\ns paper aside, put his hands behind Lakshmi=E2=80=99s horns and his\nhead ag=\r\nainst hers. Like this they stayed for quite a long time. I stood\nnearby loo=\r\nking at the wonderful scene. After some ten minutes or so,\nBhagavan turned =\r\nto me and said: =E2=80=98Do you know what Lakshmi is doing? She is\nin\nsamad=\r\nhi.=E2=80=99 I looked at her and tears were flowing in streams down her bro=\r\nad\ncheeks. Her breathing had stopped and her eyes were fixed on Bhagavan. A=\r\nfter\nsome time Bhagavan changed his position and asked: =E2=80=98Lakshmi, h=\r\now do you feel\nnow?=E2=80=99 Lakshmi moved backwards, as if reluctant to tu=\r\nrn her tail towards\nBhagavan,walked round the Hall and went out.=E2=80=9D\n\n=\r\nSeveral dogs lived in the Ashram. The most famous was Jackie,who was later\n=\r\nburied in the Ashram compound alongside the deer Valli and a crow. He did\nn=\r\not much like playing and did not join the other dogs, but would sit in\nfron=\r\nt of Sri Ramana, fixing his gaze on his eyes incessantly. He would also\nnot=\r\n start eating until Ramana had taken a mouthful of food. One day when a\nstr=\r\nay dog entered the Ashram through the back door, Jackie started barking.\nRa=\r\nmana calmed him saying, =E2=80=9CYou just close your eyes. You just close y=\r\nour\neyes. You just close your eyes. If you do this you will not be able to =\r\nsee\nthe dog.=E2=80=9D At once Jackie closed his eyes.\n\nOne day Jackie was a=\r\nttacked by a ferocious pig and was seriously injured.\nHis stomach was torn =\r\nopen and the intestines came out. It required a lot of\nstitches to close it=\r\n up and afterwards Jackie was carried to a mantapam\nopposite the Ashram to =\r\nrecover. At the same time Kunju Swami was suffering\nfrom a severe abscess o=\r\nn his foot and was also staying in the same mantapam.\nWhen Sri Ramana came =\r\nto visit them, Kunju Swami was crying out in pain and\nfell at Maharshi=E2=\r\n=80=99s feet. But Ramana said to him, =E2=80=9CSee, how Jackie is\nsilently =\r\nbearing his pain after such a major operation, without so much as a\nwhimper=\r\n!=E2=80=9D This was helpful to Kunju Swami and his pain became bearable for=\r\n\nhim. Ramana stroked Jackie and enquired if the meal had been brought and\nt=\r\nhen left both patients.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by G=\r\nabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=\r\n=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13a5a462672048018b9f3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One day a female leopard came to the water=\r\ning place near the Virupaksha Cave. The frightened devotees beat upon their=\r\n plates and drums to drive her away. But she quenched her thirst unconcerne=\r\nd and then went on her way with a roar.

That being so, is it right on your part to drive =\r\nthem away?=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ramana was equally fearless with regard to sco=\r\nrpions.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Vasudeva Sastri recounts, =\r\n=E2=80=9COne day, when we were at Skandashram, I was aghast to find a scorp=\r\nion climbing up over Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body in the front and another at th=\r\ne same time climbing down his back.

Similarly he did not object if devotees killed =\r\nmosquitoes or used insecticide in the cowshed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Maharshi had=\r\n the same compassionate attitude towards plants as towards animals. One day=\r\n workers had been deputed to gather mangoes from one of the trees. But inst=\r\nead of climbing up the tree and picking them one by one, they knocked them =\r\ndown with&lt;br&gt;\n\nsticks.

The crack =\r\nhas closed.=E2=80=9D Some days later he found the egg hatched out, the litt=\r\nle bird had come out. With a face beaming with joy he took the nestling int=\r\no his hand, stroked and caressed it and handed it to the others, that they =\r\ncould also admire it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One day some new born squirrels had f=\r\nallen out of their nest and landed on Ramana=E2=80=99s couch. Their eyes we=\r\nre still closed and they were very tiny. The mother, however, did not take =\r\nthem back. But how should one feed such tiny things?=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-style:italic&quot;&gt;The squirrels laid in Ramana=E2=80=99s palm. His face was =\r\nglowing with love and affection towards them. The devotees looked on helple=\r\nssly, but he was happy and cheerful. He asked for some cotton and made a so=\r\nft bed for them.Then he took a piece of the cotton, rolled it up so that th=\r\ne end looked like a sharp needle, dipped it into some milk and trickled it =\r\nin their tiny mouths. This he did repeatedly. He looked after them with gre=\r\nat care and love until they grew up and started running around. They did no=\r\nt run away, however, but always ran around their =E2=80=98mother=E2=80=99.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Something similar happened=\r\n, when a cat ate the mother of some young squirrels. Again Ramana took on t=\r\nhe task of caring for the young. As he liked to use daily events to teach h=\r\nis devotees he said to them, =E2=80=9CThese little ones do not know that wi=\r\nsdom lies in remaining in their nest. They keep attempting to come out. All=\r\n trouble lies outside but they cannot remain within. Similarly if the mind =\r\nis not externalised, but remains sunk in the Heart then there would only be=\r\n happiness. But the mind keeps moving out.=E2=80=9D When Rangaswami asked, =\r\n=E2=80=9CWhat is the path for keeping it inward?=E2=80=9D, Bhagavan said, =\r\n=E2=80=9CIt is exactly the same as what I am doing now. Each time a young s=\r\nquirrel comes out, I keep putting it back into its nest. When I go on doing=\r\n it, it learns the happiness of staying in the nest.=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Shantamma reports, =E2=80=9COnce Lakshmi came into the Hall. She was pre=\r\ngnant at that time. It was after lunch time, when Bhagavan was reading the =\r\nnewspapers. Lakshmi came near and started licking the papers. Bhagavan look=\r\ned up and said: =E2=80=98Wait a little, Lakshmi.=E2=80=99 But Lakshmi went =\r\non licking. Bhagavan laid his paper aside, put his hands behind Lakshmi=E2=\r\n=80=99s horns and his head against hers. Like this they stayed for quite a =\r\nlong time. I stood nearby looking at the wonderful scene. After some ten mi=\r\nnutes or so, Bhagavan turned to me and said: =E2=80=98Do you know what Laks=\r\nhmi is doing? She is in&lt;br&gt;\n\nsamadhi.=E2=80=99 I looked at her and tears we=\r\nre flowing in streams down her broad cheeks. Her breathing had stopped and =\r\nher eyes were fixed on Bhagavan. After some time Bhagavan changed his posit=\r\nion and asked: =E2=80=98Lakshmi, how do you feel now?=E2=80=99 Lakshmi move=\r\nd backwards, as if reluctant to turn her tail towards Bhagavan,walked round=\r\n the Hall and went out.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Several dogs lived in the Ashram.=\r\n The most famous was Jackie,who was later buried in the Ashram compound alo=\r\nngside the deer Valli and a crow. He did not much like playing and did not =\r\njoin the other dogs, but would sit in front of Sri Ramana, fixing his gaze =\r\non his eyes incessantly. He would also not start eating until Ramana had ta=\r\nken a mouthful of food.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One day when =\r\na stray dog entered the Ashram through the back door, Jackie started barkin=\r\ng. Ramana calmed him saying, =E2=80=9CYou just close your eyes. You just cl=\r\nose your eyes. You just close your eyes. If you do this you will not be abl=\r\ne to see the dog.=E2=80=9D At once Jackie closed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;One day Jackie was attacked by a ferociou=\r\ns pig and was seriously injured. His stomach was torn open and the intestin=\r\nes came out. It required a lot of stitches to close it up and afterwards Ja=\r\nckie was carried to a mantapam opposite the Ashram to recover. At the same =\r\ntime Kunju Swami was suffering from a severe abscess on his foot and was al=\r\nso staying in the same mantapam. When Sri Ramana came to visit them, Kunju =\r\nSwami was crying out in pain and fell at Maharshi=E2=80=99s feet. But Raman=\r\na said to him, =E2=80=9CSee, how Jackie is silently bearing his pain after =\r\nsuch a major operation, without so much as a whimper!=E2=80=9D This was hel=\r\npful to Kunju Swami and his pain became bearable for him. Ramana stroked Ja=\r\nckie and enquired if the meal had been brought and then left both patients.=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: Ramana Mah=\r\narshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd13a5a462672048018b9f3--\r\n\n"}}
