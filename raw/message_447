Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           =EF=BB=BF   Namaste,\n&gt;  =\r\n  \n&gt;   I meant it figuratively.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   For the reference on Yogananda, y=\r\nou can read the section on \nSwami Yogananda in &quot;God Lived with Them: Life S=\r\ntories of Sixteen \nMonastic Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna&quot; by Swami Chetanan=\r\nanda.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   *        *        *\n&gt;    \n&gt;   There have been many great yo=\r\ngis, babas, saints and swamis in \nthe last few thousand years of Kali yuga.=\r\n But Ramakrishna \nParamahamsa stands out in one way. He is one master who m=\r\nastered \nevery single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yog=\r\na \nand even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, \nKaali=\r\n and several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikalpa \nsamadhi, where=\r\n there is no &quot;experience&quot;. He was in sahaja samadhi \nalways. He was able in=\r\nduce tremendous experience in people by mere \ntouch or mere look. Yet he wa=\r\ns simple like a child and had zero ego \n(that is why he could do all that!!=\r\n!).\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on their sishyas and have no =\r\n\nability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sishya. They \nforc=\r\ne sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form they \nworship an=\r\nd walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight \ninto the true natu=\r\nre of each sishya and gave specific instructions. \nHe taught totally differ=\r\nent mantras, totally different forms and \ntotally different paths to differ=\r\nent sishyas. He even taught \ncontradictory things to different sishyas. Whe=\r\nn one sishya who \nneeded to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up somebod=\r\ny for \ninsulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With your attitude, \ny=\r\nou did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should \nlearn to=\r\n be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru \nin a good stea=\r\nd and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who \nneeded to mend his sof=\r\nt demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by \nsome people and came away sil=\r\nently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you.\n&gt;  Shastras say that you should kill o=\r\nne who insults your guru. How \ncan you ignore such wrong behavior? You shou=\r\nld give them a piece of \nyour mind.&quot;\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Spiritual sadhana does not m=\r\nean just chanting a mantra or \nrepeating a procedure everyday for a certain=\r\n period of time. \nSpiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one tr=\r\nansforms \noneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every act=\r\nion \nand every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for \nint=\r\nrospection and transformation of internal attitude.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Anyway, comin=\r\ng back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal \nsadhaka or a normal guru.=\r\n He belonged to a very special class of \nsadhakas and he was an exceptional=\r\n guru to an exceptional group of \nsishyas.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Without his [indirect]=\r\n blessings, I would be a nobody and would \nbe lower than dirt. I would not =\r\nbe able to say anything intelligent \nor meaningful in spiritual matters. Th=\r\nose who are impressed/inspired \nby something I write should be thankful to =\r\nmy guru Dr Manish Pandit \nand to Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace =\r\nusing me as an \ninstrument and not to me.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   BTW, you are all free t=\r\no forward my posts that you like to \npeople who may be interested in spirit=\r\nual discussions. I have no \nproblem.

It is d=\r\nangerous to follow \nsomeone \n&gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the path of d=\r\nharma basically means engaging in the right \n&gt; action/duty. Right action va=\r\nries from person to person, from time \nto time \n&gt; and from place to place. =\r\nIt is dependent on what nature expects \nfrom you, \n&gt; which in turn is based=\r\n on who you have been in the past, what \nactions you \n&gt; did in the past whi=\r\nle identifying with the action, who you \naffected in the \n&gt; past (and how) =\r\nwith the actions that you identified with, what \ndebts you \n&gt; created in th=\r\ne process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated \nuntil \n&gt; now.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature \nwants a perso=\r\nn \n&gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on \none&#39;s m=\r\nental \n&gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \n=\r\nmessage of \n&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, b=\r\nased \non one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person=\r\n to \nspread the \n&gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.=\r\n If, based \non one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a =\r\nperson to make \na lot of \n&gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;=\r\ns dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to=\r\n another.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to ki=\r\nll his \ngurus, \n&gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there w=\r\nas too \nmuch weight \n&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of s=\r\nome weight. \nTremendous \n&gt; destruction was to take place and civilization d=\r\nestroyed to a \ngreat extent, \n&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for i=\r\nt. Arjuna being a great \nwarrior, \n&gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. =\r\nSome people he deeply loved \nand \n&gt; respected were on the other side and it=\r\n was his dharma to kill \nthem.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in =\r\nthe 19th century as one of \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yog=\r\nananda had been \nArjuna in a \n&gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , =\r\nhis dharma was \ndifferent in this \n&gt; new time and place. He was born to ren=\r\nounce material life despite \nhis \n&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the si=\r\nmple life of a monk and \ninspire \n&gt; generations to embrace a simple life of=\r\n mental detachment and \nservice to \n&gt; others. When he is born again (which =\r\nhe has to, as per what \nRamakrishna \n&gt; said), his dharma based on the time =\r\nand place may be something \nelse.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The tricky question is: H=\r\now does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people have interpreted =\r\nKrishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your \nown dharma \n&gt; and not someone else&#39;s d=\r\nharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the \nconcept \n&gt; of caste (varna) has=\r\n been there in Hinduism for a long time, the \nconcept of \n&gt; caste mobility =\r\nwas very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived \nby \n&gt; killing birds. H=\r\ne became a brahmana and a maharshi later. \nVishwamitra was a \n&gt; kshatrita a=\r\nnd a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a \nmaharshi \n&gt; later. Basi=\r\ncally varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with \nthe varna \n&gt; of fath=\r\ner, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As \none \n&gt; develop=\r\ns in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the =\r\nmisinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to \nknow your \n&gt; dharm=\r\na from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 \ndharmas in \n&gt; t=\r\nhe world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma=\r\n is is very very very difficult. If one \nis pure \n&gt; enough, one will *know*=\r\n one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a \npart of our \n&gt; mind that tells us=\r\n what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a \nlot of \n&gt; noise from other =\r\nparts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, \nwe get \n&gt; confused.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and \nintuition a=\r\nnd \n&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, \nbu=\r\nt doing \n&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; \n&gt; More than following =\r\ndharma, what is of utmost importance is to \nengage in \n&gt; actions without id=\r\nentification. *That* alone ensures that we are \nnot \n&gt; accumulating new kar=\r\nmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should \nnot build \n&gt; too much attachm=\r\nent to what we are doing. We should engage in the \nbest \n&gt; possible actions=\r\n (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in \nthe given \n&gt; situation =\r\nis), with as little attachment and self-identification \nwith the \n&gt; action =\r\nas possible. When the action is finished, we should leave \nthe result \n&gt; to=\r\n god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen \nnow&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; =\r\nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication \nthrough \n&gt; un=\r\ntached action) will simplify our ego and purify our \nconsciousness slowly. =\r\n\n&gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma \nclea=\r\nrer. \n&gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to \ns=\r\nee our \n&gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This i=\r\ns \nnot easy, \n&gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline i=\r\ns: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, \none&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &quot;this is m=\r\ny dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in \naction with \n&gt; little a=\r\nttachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and in=\r\ntuition are the \ninputs. \n&gt; Another external input is the words of scriptur=\r\nes and learned men. \nOne can \n&gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special pl=\r\nace is given to one&#39;s \nspiritual \n&gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritua=\r\nl master, one can take the \nwords of \n&gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharm=\r\na and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dha=\r\nrma was and thought \nkilling gurus \n&gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had =\r\na guru in Krishna who \nclarified his \n&gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda) was confused about \nhis dharma \n&gt; and wanted to renounce the wor=\r\nld and go to a secluded place to do \nsadhana, \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cr=\r\nied and prevailed upon him to stay in \nthe material \n&gt; world and do the wor=\r\nk of Mother for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not k=\r\nnow who one is, \nwhat one&#39;s \n&gt; debts are and what nature expects from one c=\r\nan err in the judgment \nof what \n&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an ele=\r\nvated soul with a clear \ninsight into \n&gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can =\r\ngive perfect guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) ca=\r\nnnot outline a set of \nprinciples and \n&gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dh=\r\narma changes from person to \nperson, from \n&gt; time to time and from place to=\r\n place. Also, there are no \nthumbrules to find \n&gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is.=\r\n But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding \nof one&#39;s \n&gt; dharma by increasing =\r\ninternal purity. By doing various kinds of \nspiritual \n&gt; sadhana (like homa=\r\nm, japam etc) and engaging in actions without \nmuch \n&gt; attachment, one can =\r\nslowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s \nunderstanding of \n&gt; one&#39;s individua=\r\nl dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedi=\r\nc- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. ne=\r\nt\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original M=\r\nessage ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; =\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i just finishe=\r\nd my Aghora series\n&gt; &gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; Vimalanda says path of dh=\r\narma is very personal.\n&gt; &gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we =\r\napproach\n&gt; &gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upan=\r\nishads\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
