I seek your\nclarification on this point:\n&gt; (1) The rahas=\r\nyas of Chandipath describes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the &gt;\nOriginal Root of All=\r\n) form of Mahalakshmi and also the 3 derived forms &gt;\nof Mahakali, Mahalaksh=\r\nmi and Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalakshmi forms &gt;\nare different!). It does =\r\nnot specifically describe the form of &quot;Chandi&quot;.\nIf this does not specifical=\r\nly describe the form of Chandi, why then, in\nthe Chandi Homam manual - the =\r\nsection on Pranaa Pratishthaapanaa of\nChandi, you had included the verses f=\r\nrom the rahasyas of Chandipath?\nIs there any other significance that I am m=\r\nissing in my understanding?\nThank you.\nWarmest regards..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste fri=\r\nends,&gt; &gt; Based on my experience and understanding,\nI will share my 2 cents =\r\non the &gt; topics that came up recently.&gt; &gt; (1)\nThe rahasyas of Chandipath de=\r\nscribes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the &gt; Original\nRoot of All) form of Mahalakshm=\r\ni and also the 3 derived forms &gt; of\nMahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati=\r\n (the two Mahalakshmi forms &gt; are\ndifferent!). It does not specifically des=\r\ncribe the form of &quot;Chandi&quot;.&gt; &gt;\n(2) The real form of deities is energy, that=\r\n can manifest within one&#39;s &gt;\nown consciousness.&gt; &gt; (3) Lalita is a gentle f=\r\norm as the name implies.\nHowever, some of her &gt; names describe a fierce for=\r\nm. Similarly, some of\nthe names of a fierce &gt; deity may describe a gentle f=\r\norm. Bottomline is\nthat different deities &gt; describe different energy forms=\r\n and several\nother enegy forms can be &gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy =\r\nis\nconvertible.&gt; &gt; For example, you can generate electric energy or\nmagneti=\r\nc energy or &gt; mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear energy from\na big nucl=\r\near fusion. &gt; If 1000 names of the nuclear fusion describe it\nin one name a=\r\ns energy &gt; that lights up a house or a town, don&#39;t think it\nis a gentle for=\r\nm. It &gt; can support that gentle aspect too, but it is a\nvery fierce form. I=\r\nf you &gt; really see that energy in its raw form, you\nwill see that nuclear f=\r\nusion &gt; is certainly not gentle.&gt; &gt; One who\nexperienced the energy of a sup=\r\nposed fierce deity as being &gt; gentle or\nvice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that =\r\ndeity in the complete form &gt; and\nexperienced only a small derived aspect of=\r\n that deity.&gt; &gt; (4) Though I\nsay that the real form of deities is energy, t=\r\nhe &gt; iconography IS very\nimportant and holds keys. However, some keys of so=\r\nme &gt; particularly\npowerful siddha mantras are intentionally misplaced by &gt; =\r\nrishis.&gt; &gt; For\nexample, I know someone who was doing sadhana of a higher de=\r\nity. He &gt;\nwas imagining her in a form using a popular dhyana shloka. This p=\r\nopular\n&gt; dhyana shloka for that mantra - which is known to be a siddha mant=\r\nra -\n&gt; matches the imagery created by some key words in the mantra. He was =\r\n&gt;\ndoing the sadhana sincerely, but never formed a connection to the mantra\n=\r\n&gt; or experienced anything. After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him a\n&gt; =\r\ndifferent dhyana shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi of\n&gt; pas=\r\nt, which is not typically used with that particular mantra, because\n&gt; some =\r\nwords in the mantra suggest a different imagery. This sadhaka &gt;\nswitched to=\r\n it. He started visualizing the deity differently. Though &gt;\nthis visualizat=\r\nion was contrary to the words in the mantra, this &gt;\nactually worked. It mad=\r\ne a big difference. The person started to &gt;\nexperience some things internal=\r\nly and understood the essence of the &gt;\nmantra in a flash. Now, the true mea=\r\nning of the mantra became crystal &gt;\nclear through an internal experience.&gt; =\r\n&gt; The final understanding was\ninternal, philosophical and based on subtle &gt;=\r\n play of different cosmic\nenergies. But, that beautiful understanding was &gt;=\r\n triggered ONLY AFTER a\nspecific physical form was imagined by the mind.&gt; &gt;=\r\n Some powerful\nmantras do have a specific physical form associated with &gt; t=\r\nhem and you\nwill be kind of lost without knowing that form or &gt; correspondi=\r\nng\ndhyana.&gt; &gt; (5) BTW, having said the above, I need to make one important\n=\r\npoint.&gt; &gt; It is foolish to go around asking people and gurus to give you\nth=\r\ne right &gt; mantra or dhyana of this or that mantra. Until you are pure\nenoug=\r\nh and &gt; prepared, no real yogi will ever give you the keys to\nanything real=\r\nly &gt; siddha, i.e. powerful and potent enough to work\nquickly.

Now, the true meaning of the mantra became crystal&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&gt; clear through an internal experience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&gt; The final understanding was internal, philosophical and based on su=\r\nbtle&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; play of different cosmic energies. But, that beau=\r\ntiful understanding was&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; triggered ONLY AFTER a specifi=\r\nc physical form was imagined by the mind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&g=\r\nt; Some powerful mantras do have a specific physical form associated with&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; them and you will be kind of lost without knowing that =\r\nform or&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; corresponding dhyana.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; (5) BTW, having said the above, I need to make one important po=\r\nint.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; It is foolish to go around asking =\r\npeople and gurus to give you the right&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; mantra or dhyan=\r\na of this or that mantra.

It does not specifically describe the form=\r\n of &quot;Chandi&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; (2) The real form of deities is energy,=\r\n that can manifest within one&#39;s&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; own consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; (3) Lalita is a gentle form as the name implies. However, some =\r\nof her&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; names describe a fierce form. Similarly, some of the n=\r\names of a fierce&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; deity may describe a gentle form. Bottomline=\r\n is that different deities&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; describe different energy forms an=\r\nd several other enegy forms can be&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *derived* from that energy=\r\n. Energy is convertible.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; For example, you can generat=\r\ne electric energy or magnetic energy or&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; mechanical kinetic en=\r\nergy from nuclear energy from a big nuclear fusion.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; If 1000 n=\r\names of the nuclear fusion describe it in one name as energy&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nthat lights up a house or a town, don&#39;t think it is a gentle form. It&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; can support that gentle aspect too, but it is a very fierce form. =\r\nIf you&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; really see that energy in its raw form, you will see t=\r\nhat nuclear fusion&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; is certainly not gentle.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; One who experienced the energy of a supposed fierce deity as being&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;&gt; gentle or vice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that deity in the comple=\r\nte form&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; and experienced only a small derived aspect of that d=\r\neity.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; (4) Though I say that the real form of deities =\r\nis energy, the&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; iconography IS very important and holds keys. =\r\nHowever, some keys of some&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; particularly powerful siddha mantr=\r\nas are intentionally misplaced by&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; rishis.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; For example, I know someone who was doing sadhana of a higher deity. He&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; was imagining her in a form using a popular dhyana shloka. Th=\r\nis popular&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; dhyana shloka for that mantra - which is known to =\r\nbe a siddha mantra -&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; matches the imagery created by some key =\r\nwords in the mantra. He was&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; doing the sadhana sincerely, but =\r\nnever formed a connection to the mantra&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; or experienced anythi=\r\nng. After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him a&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; different d=\r\nhyana shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi of&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; pa=\r\nst, which is not typically used with that particular mantra, because&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; some words in the mantra suggest a different imagery. This sadhaka&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; switched to it. He started visualizing the deity differently.=\r\n Though&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; this visualization was contrary to the words in the m=\r\nantra, this&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; actually worked. It made a big difference. The pe=\r\nrson started to&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; experience some things internally and underst=\r\nood the essence of the&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; mantra in a flash. Now, the true meani=\r\nng of the mantra became crystal&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; clear through an internal exp=\r\nerience.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The final understanding was internal, philos=\r\nophical and based on subtle&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; play of different cosmic energies=\r\n. But, that beautiful understanding was&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; triggered ONLY AFTER =\r\na specific physical form was imagined by the mind.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; So=\r\nme powerful mantras do have a specific physical form associated with&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; them and you will be kind of lost without knowing that form or&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; corresponding dhyana.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; (5) BTW, having said =\r\nthe above, I need to make one important point.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; It is =\r\nfoolish to go around asking people and gurus to give you the right&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; mantra or dhyana of this or that mantra. Until you are pure enough an=\r\nd&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; prepared, no real yogi will ever give you the keys to anyth=\r\ning really&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; siddha, i.e. powerful and potent enough to work qu=\r\nickly.
