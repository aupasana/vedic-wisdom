If you do not know the \nright deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick \nwhatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.\n\nPlease remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from \nsadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, \nsadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, \nsometimes it may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas \nbefore some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a \nbasket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you to do \nserious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or middle of \nthe pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits \nof those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and \nretrieving those karmas. In the process, some other karmas may spill over \nand give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had \nto be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!\n\nA serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly \nundesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.\n\nOne gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good \npriest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he was \nlaid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sadhana \nand used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pilgrimage \nto some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted \nat the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got \nthe opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the house \nof a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact with my guru \nvery closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision of the Mother on \n2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start the work on spreading \nhomam in the world, this gentleman was present there. Though he could not \nsee the Mother, he actually smelled something out of the world and was \nbaffled. He knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple \nwas closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people \non the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the \nMother, it was most fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial \nmoment. That is enough to mould the rest of his life.\n\nYou never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on you. \nCalculations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god. Just \nsurrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs \nfine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that \nhappen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling \nsome debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really \nauspicious karmas.\n\nAs Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. Have devotion \nand patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Namaste Sir\n&gt; what you said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous\n&gt; but i have some small doubts\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have a guru\n&gt; how can they chooose a particular form of GOD\n&gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity\n&gt; is very important, as the analogy he gave of a person\n&gt; who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing more\n&gt; we have so many deities  that on diwali i would like to worship\n&gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n&gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we would worship Durga\n&gt; on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA\n&gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA\n&gt; like this\n&gt; with hte change in festival the deity changes\n&gt;\n&gt; though everybody knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficult to get\n&gt; out of this\n&gt; mould and if i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become\n&gt; angry\n&gt;\n&gt; I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose if i choose a deity and something wrong happens\n&gt; (materiallistically)\n&gt;\n&gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my\n&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS\n&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as I  am not fit\n&gt; for that DEITY\n&gt;\n&gt; and sometimes you feel\n&gt; o what am i doing does this really works\n&gt;\n&gt; and one thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; what if we go on doing our pooja and someday\n&gt; something like what happened to Pt. GOPI KRISHNA JI\n&gt; happens to us also\n&gt; though he says in his book that he read a lot about yoga\n&gt; and stuff like this\n&gt;\n&gt; At any stage i do not want you people to get offended\n&gt; but these are my doubts which are there in my mind\n&gt;\n&gt; i will not say much now bcoz in\n&gt; Swami Sivananda&#39;s KUNDALINI YOGA on the last page he says\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;the shastras are endless and there is so much to be known\n&gt; turn the gaze. draw the indriyas.still the mind.then\n&gt; dive deep into the divine source and realise the infinite bliss&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *********************************************************************\n&gt; *\n&gt; i ll give one small personal example here\n&gt;\n&gt; around 26 or 27 dec.2007 i started chanting 2 mantras (one kar mala\n&gt; each)\n&gt; in morning and evening\n&gt; and on 9 january 2008 my parents met an accident\n&gt; though my father suffered small injuries my mother suffred fracture\n&gt; in shoulder and Leg\n&gt;\n&gt; and she is still undergoing treatment and will have to\n&gt; undergo one more operation in this month\n&gt;\n&gt; and in February and March i got placement in\n&gt; 2 companies (i m doing MCA in india) where most of my friends have\n&gt; not\n&gt; even got one and let me tell you i m not very intelligent\n&gt;\n&gt; so sometimes even now i consider whether my choosen deity is correct\n&gt; or not\n&gt;\n&gt; so everyday in the end of my pooja what i ask GOD is\n&gt; to help me find the right path\n&gt; *********************************************************************\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I will\n&gt; continue in\n&gt;&gt; the same vein for a little more time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I had a dream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In the\n&gt; dream,\n&gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were\n&gt; sitting in\n&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not\n&gt; recognize.\n&gt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen before.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. First\n&gt; he said he\n&gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;ve\n&gt; probably known if\n&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it\n&gt; there.\n&gt;&gt; However, when we talked in the next weekend, he referred to my\n&gt; dream and\n&gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to\n&gt; search on\n&gt;&gt; the internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n&gt; my dream.\n&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before\n&gt; him). Though\n&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this\n&gt; lineage and\n&gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the internet and\n&gt; found a\n&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw\n&gt; in my\n&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my dream looked\n&gt; like a\n&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and\n&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about the\n&gt; lineage of\n&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from\n&gt; Dattatreya. We\n&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his\n&gt; lineage and got\n&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from\n&gt; them. We do\n&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.\n&gt; But,\n&gt;&gt; Manish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he\n&gt; guessed\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he\n&gt; guessed\n&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle connections\n&gt; between\n&gt;&gt; several lineages that seem disjoint today.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of\n&gt; Sri\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted\n&gt; me within a\n&gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa\n&gt; Yogananda were\n&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the\n&gt; keeper of\n&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar\n&gt; Maharaj.\n&gt;&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a\n&gt; day at my\n&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small connection was made with a representative\n&gt; of that\n&gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may\n&gt; have been\n&gt;&gt; there...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the impression that my\n&gt; guru has\n&gt;&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he\n&gt; always\n&gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He\n&gt; says,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and capable\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection between every\n&gt; entity in\n&gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument\n&gt; sometimes\n&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no special abilities of any\n&gt; kind. Any\n&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego\n&gt; is not\n&gt;&gt; fake. I also realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to\n&gt; do things\n&gt;&gt; that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many\n&gt; great\n&gt;&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several magical things happened\n&gt; through\n&gt;&gt; them, but they did not find any pride in them and retained their\n&gt; humility\n&gt;&gt; and sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and believed\n&gt; that god\n&gt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake of\n&gt; lecturing or\n&gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadhana\n&gt; will bear\n&gt;&gt; fruit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
