This rule is appl=\r\nicable for those who are Lalithambika Upasakas only. It does not apply to o=\r\nthers. This is not applicable to Kalika, Tara, Chandika or any other Devath=\r\na either even amongst those who follow Sri Vidya traditions.\n\n\nS\n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne Sir,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; the magazine published by the Rochester Devi temple\n&gt;  \n&gt; I =\r\ntruly appreciate the sincerity of Haran aiya, his disciples and his lineage=\r\n. I visited that temple once and was impressed with the attitude of people =\r\nrunning it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Devi Upasaka must never cut S=\r\nugarcane since it\n&gt; &gt; is held in the hands of the goddess.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A few poin=\r\nts:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) Sugarcane is crushed to make sugar and jaggery, which we all =\r\nuse. If cutting sugarcane offends the Mother because she holds it, won&#39;t cr=\r\nushing sugarcane offend her?\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) If you are cutting the sugarcane &quot;in=\r\n her hand&quot; to feed &quot;her son&quot; (Ganesha) one of his favorite foods, do you re=\r\nally think the Mother will be angry with you?\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) Seriously and philo=\r\nsophically speaking, does one really think that the divine Mother has an at=\r\ntachment to physical sugarcane that she is depicted as holding?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Physical forms of deities described in scriptures are =\r\nsymbolic. Of course, one who thinks of a physical form may have a vision of=\r\n a deity in that form. However, such a form is basically symbolic of higher=\r\n truths.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For example, what does sugarcane denote? It gives rise to sw=\r\neetness. However, it does not come without effort. You have to cut, crush a=\r\nnd squeeze sugarcane in order to extract the sweet and nutritious juice fro=\r\nm it. Mother&#39;s holding of sugarcane is symbolic of the fact that She gives =\r\nsweet knowledge and bliss, which come after serious effort.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Deities are personifications of higher states that can be =\r\nattained by our consciousness. All the weapons, jewelery and other things h=\r\neld by deities are symbolic of various things given by them or used by them=\r\n to fight our weaknesses.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, some orthodox practices and beli=\r\nefs may have evolved around taking such symbols literally. Those who want t=\r\no follow may follow and those who want to move on may move on. \n&gt;  \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I personally see absolutely no problem in offering sug=\r\narcane pieces in homam, if one has a big enough fire to burn those pieces f=\r\nully. However, if &quot;Devi upasakas&quot; belonging to lineages that ban the cuttin=\r\ng and use of sugarcane want, they may kindly follow the teachings of their =\r\ngurus and avoid sugarcane pieces.\n&gt;  \n&gt; At the end of the day, external rit=\r\nuals are symbols and internal changes denoted by those symbols will slowly =\r\nbe triggered after repeated performance of the ritual. If an external symbo=\r\nlic action robs one of peace and creates a sense of wrong-doing or inauspic=\r\niousness or guilt in one&#39;s mind, it is not worth it! Either remove the sens=\r\ne of wrong-doing through reasoning or stick to orthodox rules you are expos=\r\ned to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;   =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha ji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have be=\r\nen doing homam for Lord Ganesha and have been using pieces of fresh sugarca=\r\nne also as offering for the Lord. I happenned to recently study the magazin=\r\ne published by the Rochester Devi temple and they specifically mentioned in=\r\n one of the articles that a Devi Upasaka must never cut Sugarcane since it =\r\nis held in the hands of the goddess.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also remember something to =\r\nthe effect of &quot;Ikshu Khandam &quot; should not be offered in some of the devi pu=\r\nja manuals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lalithopasako na iskshu khandam bhakshayet&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI have been only offering it out of sincere love for Lord Ganapati since fe=\r\nlt he is extremely fond of Sugarcane .Often have read your writing stating =\r\nthat one must not be afraid to approach god and must take up homa with the =\r\nmind of a child . \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please do advice if I could continue to offer t=\r\nhe pieces or if am committing a grave mistake by offending the goddess .\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
