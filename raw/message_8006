When I saw this mail I thought it looks ve=\r\nry difficult but as I was reading it I noticed that words\nlike Love or Grac=\r\ne were not mentioned even once. In my experience without=A0Love, Grace, Joy=\r\n, Magic, Light, Bliss and similar things spiritual path becomes very dry.Se=\r\nveral months ago I was thinking ---this Narasimha guy is like rishi, he is =\r\nhelping so many people on spiritual path. I fully support him yet many of m=\r\ny spiritual experiences are very different and when I write them he feels s=\r\nubtle pain. perhaps I should no longer write here.These thoughts were in my=\r\n mind.\nThen Divine Mother Smiled. Same Divine Mother you meditate upon when=\r\n you do gayatrijap.\nSame Divine Mother who has 18 hands.\nSame Divine Mother=\r\n Whose Grace has protected me for so long.\nI felt deep peace.\nSeveral days =\r\nago I saw this mail . I could not believe it\n\n-------Again, the key is not =\r\nto see a god or a goddess, but to be=A0\nde-conditioned enough to really ben=\r\nefit from it!=A0-------\n\n\nWe worship Divine Beings. We go to their Temple. =\r\nWe do the jap of their mantra. We fast. We meditate. We do several other th=\r\nings to please them and get their Grace. And when the Light from Their Aura=\r\n fills our physical eyes, we have to deny them. Right. This is the most =A0=\r\nabsurd thing I have seen for a long time.\n\nWhat is beyond Divine Mother? Al=\r\nl types of samadhi and moksha and known and unknown things are due to her d=\r\nirect or indirect Grace. Why cannot we simply enjoy Her Presence and feel t=\r\nhe Bliss.\nWhat is wrong in asking her for magical spiritual experiences or =\r\nHer Darshan. After all do we not ask Her for material things all the time\n=\r\n=A0If someone is puffed up and during meditation is not grounded and wants =\r\nto become master of universe, so what. It does not mean that those do medit=\r\nation in a proper way and feel bliss are in delusion. Car is a good mode of=\r\n transport yet so many people are hurt every year. Should we stop using it?=\r\n\n\n.I very much hope that those who do haven or other spiritual things with =\r\nlove and devotion and secretly desire for beautiful spiritual experiences o=\r\nr darshan of their Eshtdav would keep dreaming their dream. Only thing to r=\r\nemember is that it works through Grace and not by their doing.\nEgo and Know=\r\nledge.\nWhat is ego? If we have knowledge of something which is right then s=\r\nhould we not protect ourselves.\nI was in a dentist chair and 2 senior denti=\r\nst were checking my mouth. They wanted to pull out one tooth but I refused =\r\nbecause there was nothing wrong with it.Then with instruments in my mouth o=\r\nne thug said it is his ego. I did not say anything after treatment and left=\r\n. I did not go there again. They called me again but I never went there. Th=\r\nat tooth remained in my mouth for 20 more years. What should I have done? m=\r\nake myself humble and lower my ego so they can hurt me.\nMy take is that I a=\r\nm always kind and sincere to all beings. Open doors for them and let them g=\r\net ahead of me and help others as much as possible. If despite of all this =\r\ntamcik energy comes, do I not keep my ego strong to protect my self and my =\r\nSanatanDharma. Why should I make myself artificially humble.\n\nNarasimhaBhai=\r\n, you will have to excuse me as I do not agree with several things you wrot=\r\ne. Just my luck.\nHappy Holi and green burfi but not too much as it tends to=\r\n make anybody master of galaxy even without meditation.\nThanks\nLaxmiNarayan=\r\n\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n\nFrom: NarasimhaPVRRao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com \nSent: Wednesday, 29 February 2012, 4:08\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Spiritual Progress, Ego & Experiences\n\nOm Harih Om\nNamaste friends,\n\nA lo=\r\nt of people asked in the past how to know if they are making \nspiritual pro=\r\ngress with their sadhana or not. This is a loaded question, \nbut I will sha=\r\nre a few random thoughts on\n this and several related \ntopics. More than ho=\r\nw to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writing \non how NOT to try to =\r\nrecognize it!\n\nIf you don&#39;t like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me =\r\nand follow \nyour gurus and others whom you may prefer.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nMATERIAL RESULTS\n\nOne obvious thing is that some people =\r\nget material benefits, like \nmarriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That=\r\n reinforces or increases \nfaith in the initial stages and makes one continu=\r\ne sadhana.\n\nHowever, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such materi=\r\nal \nresults do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we \niden=\r\ntify spiritual progress?\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nGOAL OF SADH=\r\nANA\n\nSpiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in \n=\r\nscriptures. Though different scriptures may use\n different words, it all \nb=\r\noils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, \nattachments =\r\nand agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the \nmind. How free we =\r\nare is indicated by how much we are able to resist and \novercome this innat=\r\ne conditioning.\n\nMaharshiVasishtha taught Lord Rama in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; t=\r\nhat \nSelf-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga=\r\n \n(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; as &quot;yogaHchittavRttinirodhaH&quot; \n(Co=\r\nmmunion is resisting the working of conditioning).\n\nThis conditioning infla=\r\ntes ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, \nwe can deflate the ego com=\r\npletely and then identify with the entire \nuniverse, instead of a single en=\r\ntity with a single agenda.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nIDENTIFYIN=\r\nG CONDITIONING\n\nInnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what de=\r\ntermines our \nlikes,\n dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (o=\r\nr dislike) \nsome people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some =\r\nthings \nthough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) t=\r\nhose \nthings. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated =\r\n\nover many lives.\n\nWhen someone praises us, we may know that it is irreleva=\r\nnt (our inner \nvoice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone =\r\nputs us \ndown, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us =\r\nso) \nand yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something about it. A=\r\nll \nthis comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over many \nliv=\r\nes.\n\nIdnetifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, \n=\r\ncalculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key \ni=\r\ns to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the \ninner =\r\nvoice of conscience is telling us one\n thing and we are impelled \nfrom insi=\r\nde to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of \nconditioning.=\r\n We often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey \nthe inner voice =\r\nof our conditioning.\n\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - =\r\nphysical or mental \n- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it mea=\r\nns our \nconditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measu=\r\nre of \nspiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for others to \n=\r\njudge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.\n\nThe tricky thing is that o=\r\nur self-analysis and self-judgment is also \ncontrolled by our conditioning!=\r\n! Suppose I engaged in an action against \nmy inner voice. Suppose I want to=\r\n analyze what just happened and whether \nI violated my inner voice of consc=\r\nience. That whole process is governed \nby the conditioning too. Depending o=\r\nn how deeply I am conditioned to \nthink that I am a good\n person doing the =\r\nright thing and not making a \nmistake, my mind will be impelled to label th=\r\ne inner voice of conscience \nas a voice of confusion and not accord it any =\r\nimportance. Instead, it \nwill focus on the inner voice of conditioning (whi=\r\nch shouts out from \ninside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclu=\r\nde that I did the \nright thing.\n\nThe grip of conditioning is too tight to o=\r\nvercome in a day or two! But, \nthe inner voice of conscience does tell ever=\r\nyone when one is doing \nsomething wrong under the influence of conditioning=\r\n. If one keeps \ntrying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome condit=\r\nioning.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCES\n\nSometime=\r\ns, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal or \nmystical =\r\nor out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams.\n\nFor example, one person I =\r\nknow started to feel very light in the head \nwith a vision of bright light =\r\nof a particular color, when he meditated \nwith a specific mantra. Another p=\r\nerson felt like there was a big fire at \nthe base of his spine and the enti=\r\nre lower back was on fire (he actually \nfelt unbearably hot), when he medit=\r\nated with a specific mantra. Another \nperson saw a deity appear in front of=\r\n him and the deity talked to him. \nInterestingly, the same deity was seen b=\r\ny another person who was also \nsitting there at the same time and that pers=\r\non had a totally different \n(and more mundane) mental conversation with the=\r\n same deity at the same \ntime. Another person felt like he became very ligh=\r\nt and was floating in \nair and there was an inexpressible happiness. In ano=\r\nther case, one \nsadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his =\r\njob was done \non earth and he could now leave. He thought, &quot;let me leave an=\r\nd let me \ntake some more with me&quot;. He felt like he was a point moving up\n w=\r\nith a \ntremendous speed. At the same time, another person who was meditatin=\r\ng a \nfew feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling =\r\n\nthat person forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelmed.\n\nThere ar=\r\ne so many possible experiences. But the key point is that \nexperiences are =\r\nsecondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for \nspiritual progres=\r\ns. I had my share of experiences, progress and setbacks \nand I am 100% sure=\r\n of the above. You&#39;ll do well to remember this \nsentence and not be swayed =\r\nby stories of experiences or desire them \nconsciously or sub-consciously. I=\r\n will elabate a little later on the \ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.=\r\n\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nEXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION=\r\n\n\nWe say that god can be known only by experience and not by reading \nbooks=\r\n. That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous\n of an \nexper=\r\nience, one may experience an aspect of god&#39;s Delusory Power instead \nof god=\r\n and that may increase false pride (a true experience of god will \ninstead =\r\nproduce infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.\n\nThere is a famo=\r\nus quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of \ntheory. Though th=\r\nat is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of \nexperience is usele=\r\nss if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of \ntheory may actually be =\r\nbetter if it actually reduces one&#39;s ego to a \npound or an ounce!\n\nThe issue=\r\n is not whether one needs practical experience or theoretical \nunderstandin=\r\ng. That is secondary. The primary thing is what is happening \nto one&#39;s ego.=\r\n Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubtedly \nthe main issue. I=\r\nf reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretical \nunderstanding etc reduce e=\r\ngo from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to \na pound and from a pound to =\r\nan\n ounce, even without a direct experience, \nthat&#39;s awesome. That is bette=\r\nr than getting a ton of experience and ego \nbeing inflated from a pound to =\r\na quintal.\n\nThough it is true that ego does not become complete zero withou=\r\nt an \n&quot;experience&quot; of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that \n=\r\n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it \nt=\r\no as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come by \nitse=\r\nlf.\n\nIn the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is a nice line: &quot;Don&#39;t \nc=\r\nhase success, but chase capability. Success will follow automatically.&quot; \nSi=\r\nmilarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase detachment and deflation \nof eg=\r\no. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experience without \ntrying=\r\n to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the horse. To use \nthe analo=\r\ngy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one then runs the risk of \nbecoming the spiri=\r\ntual equivalent of ChaturRamalingam (alias Silencer) \nof that movie, who ch=\r\nased success, ended up with huge ego from limited \nsuccess and failed in th=\r\ne end!\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING\n\nA=\r\ns said above, it is a bad idea to seek an &quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego \nis s=\r\ntill a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one&#39;s conditioning is \ndense =\r\nenough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be \ncounter-productive. The r=\r\neason is that any experience will be \ninterpreted (and absorbed into one&#39;s =\r\nsystem!!!) through the color of \none&#39;s conditioning.\n\nIf I go into the open=\r\n and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see \nthat Sun is orange. But, =\r\nsuppose I see Sun from green colored glass \nwindows of a house. Or suppose =\r\nI go into the open, but see Sun through \ngreen eyeglasses. In either case, =\r\nI will see that Sun is green. I am \nexperiencing the real Sun, but I will g=\r\net\n the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun \nis green&quot;.\n\nSimilarly, even a genuine sp=\r\niritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN \ngenerate false knowledge (e.g. S=\r\nun is green!) if one&#39;s conditioning is \nconducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).=\r\n\n\nThe key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* =\r\n\nand absorb the experience into one&#39;s system well. One&#39;s conditioning \ninfl=\r\nuences how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual \nexper=\r\niences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the \nabove e=\r\nxample!\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nDIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES\n\nIn =\r\nayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic \nbuildup =\r\nin the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various \ntissues a=\r\nnd create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and \nfeel health=\r\ny despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one \ndevelops serio=\r\nus diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts \nof the body. Th=\r\ne ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food \nbeing taken in an=\r\nd the working of even medicines one may take in. When \ntoo much ama has acc=\r\numulated and destabilizes the system, one may need \nto go through a painful=\r\n de-toxification process.\n\nSimilarly, spiritual experiences one cannot dige=\r\nst well become spiritual \nama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can=\r\n slowly build up, get \nabsorbed into various aspects of one&#39;s being and cre=\r\nate various diseases \nin the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look =\r\nand feel \nspiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiri=\r\ntual \nama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can =\r\n\neventually affect one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for \nde-=\r\ntoxification) may be far more difficult than the physical \npancha-karma.\n\n*=\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS\n\nTo illustrate=\r\n what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a \n*hypothetical* =\r\nexample.\n\nSuppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates=\r\n. \nSuppose one starts to get some special inner experiences and some \nseemi=\r\nngly supernatural things start happening externally around one. \nSuppose th=\r\nese experiences give one the impression that one is special \nand one is mak=\r\ning excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one reads some \nspiritual books a=\r\nnd fantasizes &quot;becoming like Shiva&quot; mentioned in those \nbooks. Then one may=\r\n start to think &quot;may be, I have become like Shiva&quot; \nand slowly convince one=\r\nself that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one \nreads a spiritual book th=\r\nat claims &quot;If one becomes like Shiva, the whole \nuniverse connives against =\r\none who causes an offense to him&quot;.\n\nOf\n course, there is a context behind e=\r\nvery statement and no statement is \nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, on=\r\ne may digest and absorb it into \none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one c=\r\nould have also said, &quot;if one \nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully =\r\nco-operates with one and \nthere is no way anyone can really cause offense t=\r\no that person&quot;.\n\nAnyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one =\r\nhas indeed \nbecome like Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing=\r\n offense\nand suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shap=\r\nes in \nclouds, one can find any correlations in things happening around one=\r\n. \nOne will find a few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one \n=\r\nhas become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to people around one, \none =\r\nmay start correlating them to good and bad done by those people to \none and=\r\n/or to things one has done. Over time, the delusion may become so \ndeep tha=\r\nt it just feels so natural and obvious. This is like a serious \ndisease dev=\r\neloping from a toxic buildup of undigested or badly digested \nfood. Inabili=\r\nty to fully understand the spiritual experiences one had, \nthe fantasy of b=\r\necoming like Shiva, the pre-exising pride (like \npre-existing ama) and the =\r\nnot-so-well-digested notion that offense to \nShiva causes harm, have togeth=\r\ner created spiritual ama buildup that now \nresulted in a serious disease.\n\n=\r\nThough original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming \nlate=\r\nr on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the \nill-dig=\r\nested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is \nconducive to =\r\ncreating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of \nthe system can s=\r\npread to others.\n\nAs said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting infl=\r\nated or \ndeflated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong tra=\r\nck. \nOne is either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences du=\r\ne \nto pre-existing conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either \nc=\r\nase, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested well and is \nweaken=\r\ning the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, \nego is =\r\ngetting deflated, then one is on the right track. Whatever one is \nexperien=\r\ncing is being digested well and strengthening the system.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nSHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES\n\nThis emphasis on ego def=\r\nlation may make some people wonder about the \nprominence given in some book=\r\ns to accumulation of shakti, siddhis and \nmiracles. For example, some books=\r\n describe what a being like Shiva or \nsomeone less but still with high enou=\r\ngh shakti, can do.\n\nYes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to en=\r\nlightenment MAY \nhave a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some spec=\r\nial things. \nBut, no book said that you get those abilities by being proud =\r\nor \npursuing something that can make one proud.\n\nIn fact, if one looks at t=\r\nhose abilities described in books and adores \nthem from one&#39;s *current* lev=\r\nels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin \nto looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; fr=\r\nom green eyeglasses and admiring the \ngreenness of that Sun!!! In other wor=\r\nds, one has missed the whole point. \nOne with dense conditioning can&#39;t even=\r\n understand what that shakti or \nability really means or comes from. In ord=\r\ner to understand what shakti\nis, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach su=\r\nch a state, one MUST \ndeflate one&#39;s ego.\n\nBottomline is this: Most scriptur=\r\nes of most religions are unanimous in \nteaching the importance of humility,=\r\n compassion and ego deflation. No \nscripture talks about the glory of pride=\r\n and ego inflation. It&#39;s as \nsimple as that.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0\n *=A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 *\n\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS\n\nWe encounter some peop=\r\nle who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses \nand also conversations =\r\nwith them. When probed, there is nothing sublime \ncoming from the divine be=\r\nings in their encounters. Whatever the divine \nbeings supposedly said is we=\r\nll within what one consciously or \nsub-consciously already knew or believed=\r\n or wanted to believe.\n\nThis may remind one of the encounters of Mahatma Ga=\r\nndhi by the character \nplayed by SanjayDutt in hit bollywood movie &quot;LageRah=\r\neMunnabhai&quot;. In \nthat movie, the visions are due to &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in=\r\n Munnabhai&#39;s\nmind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer que=\r\nstions \nthat Munnabhai himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know).=\r\n So \nthe conclusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a \nchar=\r\nacter in his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai\nunderstands of Ga=\r\nndhi.\n\nIn the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different from =\r\nthis \nmovie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting based on al=\r\nl \nthat one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a \nr=\r\neal being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her actions are \ninte=\r\nrpreted strictly based on one&#39;s conditioning, like the &quot;green Sun&quot; \nin our =\r\nprevious example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine \nbeings say fit=\r\ns well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or \nsub-consciously al=\r\nready knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nIn the rare case of a sadhaka=\r\n with very little conditioning having a \nreal divine encounter, it is like =\r\nan innocent child meeting mother or \nfather, and there is a real flow of di=\r\nvine and sublime understanding and \nwisdom.\n\nAgain, the key is not to see a=\r\n god or a goddess, but to be \nde-conditioned enough to really benefit from =\r\nit!\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nKUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE\n\nOne m=\r\nore thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. \nKundali=\r\nnishakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this \nis &quot;I&quot;). Ku=\r\nndalini being asleep in Mooladharachakra means one does not \neven question =\r\nwho one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties \nself down to th=\r\ne physical body and physical senses. However, \nself-awareness rising above =\r\nthis does not necessarily mean spiritual \nprogress or enlightenment. Kundal=\r\nini awakening is only the beginning of \na long process. If one&#39;s conditioni=\r\nng is deeply holding down to subtle \nideas of who one is (e.g. I am a great=\r\n spiritual soul who saved the \nworld many times in the past and came back t=\r\no save it), an awakened \nKundalini may take one&#39;s notion of self beyond the=\r\n physical body, but \nwill get stuck somewhere else. In\n fact, one&#39;s subtle =\r\nnotions of self may \nbecome aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive re=\r\ngions and one may \nexperience things that aggravate and strengthen those no=\r\ntions. One may \nget badly stuck.\n\nAs mentioned above, any spiritual experie=\r\nnce can create spiritual ama\nwhen not digested properly. Any pre-existing c=\r\nonditioning may make it \ndifficult to digest anything complex. Instead of e=\r\nating a heavy-duty \nprotein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxic bu=\r\nildup in the \nsystem, one is better off eating simple food that one&#39;s own s=\r\nystem can \nprocess and digest well.\n\nTo be clear, whether one&#39;sKundalini is=\r\n awakened or not, and where one&#39;s\nKundalini is currently, is NOT a measure =\r\nof one&#39;s spiritual progress. As \nKundalini does not rise through a single p=\r\nath, as the rise is not linear \nand as the obstructions are not uniform in =\r\nall people, one cannot \ncompare two people based on Kundalini experiences.\n=\r\n\nOne can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slowly and \noneday=\r\nKundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another \nperson may=\r\n awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it is \nextremely dif=\r\nficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.\n\nThe bottomline is that =\r\nhow much conditioning is overcome and how reduced \none&#39;s ego is is the corr=\r\nect measure of spiritual progress and not \nwhether Kundalini is awakened an=\r\nd where Kundalini is.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nCORRELATIONS GA=\r\nLORE\n\nDo not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or ma=\r\ny \nnot mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, &quot;wow, I was \n=\r\njust thinking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something and someone says, \n&quot;=\r\nwow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read \nmy m=\r\nind.&quot; Suppose you were unhappy with the\n happenings in some region of \nthe =\r\nworld, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened \nthere. Or =\r\nsuppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did some \nsadhana and th=\r\ne desire was fulfilled.\n\nIn several such cases, correlating a result with s=\r\nomething you did can \noften increase pride and your sense of self-worth. An=\r\nd, doing that will \nnot enable you to do your dharma any better.\n\nKeep thin=\r\nking your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and \nkeep doing you=\r\nr sadhana. That&#39;s it. Don&#39;t correlate actions and results \nand think that y=\r\nou made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and \ngod gives results. =\r\nThe sense of &quot;I made X happen&quot; is conducive to pride \nand ego inflation. Mo=\r\nreover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether \naction A or B caused resul=\r\nt X or Y, because the action-result pipeline \nhas variable delay!! So, why =\r\neven bother to correlate and run the risk \nof ego\n inflation?\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nBOTTOMLINE\n\nDon&#39;t run after special experiences an=\r\nd special abilities or anything \nthat makes you special (as you imagine cur=\r\nrently, based on your dense \nconditioning). Spiritual progress is not about=\r\n becoming &quot;special&quot;, but \nabout becoming humble. Special experiences and ab=\r\nilities do not matter \nat all. In fact, they can distract one and give fals=\r\ne pride. God makes \none special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost =\r\ncompletely.\n\nAlso, stop correlating things happening to or around you, with=\r\n your \nactions, and think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in action=\r\ns is \nyour sacred duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time =\r\nis \ngod&#39;s prerogative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe=\r\n \nin one&#39;s thinking.\n\nRemember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful=\r\n measure of \nspiritual progress is\n how deflated your ego is and how humble=\r\n you become \n(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have rea=\r\nlly become \ninternally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptati=\r\nons of \nfollowing the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and h=\r\now \nwell you can follow the voice of conscience.\n\nWhen inflations in ego oc=\r\ncur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice \nit, bring it to the attentio=\r\nn and perhaps even be ruthless in belling \nthe cat [of ego]. But most gurus=\r\n now-a-days may not do that well. So, \nyou have to do your best to avoid an=\r\ny serious ego inflations.\n\nUnfortunately, the path of spiritual progress an=\r\nd self-realization IS \nvery very very likely for most of us to include many=\r\n many many \nopportunities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep=\r\n a strict \nwatch on your ego.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nIf I of=\r\nfended anybody with some\n strong assertions in this email, my \napologies.\n\n=\r\nOm Tat Sat.\n\nKrishnarapanamstu,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish =\r\nLessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand PitriTarpana:\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\n=A0 =A0 =A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg\n=A0 =A0 =A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=A0=\r\n Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Twitter ID: @homam108\n-----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n----------------------=\r\n--------------\n\n|| Om ShaantihShaantihShaantih ||\nYahoo!

This is a loaded question, &lt;br&gt;but I will share a few random =\r\nthoughts on\n this and several related &lt;br&gt;topics. More than how to &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-31&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;recognize&lt;/span&gt; spiritual progress, I will=\r\n be writing &lt;br&gt;on how NOT to try to &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-32&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;recognize&lt;/span&gt; it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don&#39;t like my 2 cents, kindly feel fre=\r\ne to ignore me and follow &lt;br&gt;your gurus and others whom you may prefer.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAT=\r\nERIAL RESULTS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One obvious thing is that some people get material ben=\r\nefits, like &lt;br&gt;marriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces o=\r\nr increases &lt;br&gt;faith in the initial stages and makes one continue &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-33&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhana&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, that may no=\r\nt happen to everyone. Moreover, such material &lt;br&gt;results do not necessaril=\r\ny show spiritual progress. So, how do we &lt;br&gt;identify spiritual progress?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GO=\r\nAL OF &lt;span\n id=3D&quot;misspell-34&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;SADHANA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirit=\r\nual progress is an internal thing. It is well &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-35&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;characterized&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;br&gt;scriptures. Though different scriptu=\r\nres may use\n different words, it all &lt;br&gt;boils down to one thing. What bind=\r\ns us is our likes, dislikes, &lt;br&gt;attachments and agendas, which come from i=\r\nnnate conditioning of the &lt;br&gt;mind. How free we are is indicated by how muc=\r\nh we are able to resist and &lt;br&gt;overcome this innate conditioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;misspell-36&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Maharshi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell=\r\n-37&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Vasishtha&lt;/span&gt; taught Lord Rama in &quot;Yoga &lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nmisspell-38&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Vaasishtham&lt;/span&gt;&quot; that &lt;br&gt;Self-&lt;span id=3D&quot;m=\r\nisspell-39&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;realization&lt;/span&gt; means overcoming conditioning=\r\n. &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-40&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Patanjali&lt;/span&gt; defined Yoga &lt;br=\r\n&gt;(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-41&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sut=\r\nras&lt;/span&gt;&quot; as &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-42&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;yogaH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span =\r\nid=3D&quot;misspell-43&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;chitta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-44&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;vRtti&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-45&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;nirodhaH&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&quot; &lt;br&gt;(Communion is resisting the\n working of conditioning).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T=\r\nhis conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, &lt;br&gt;w=\r\ne can deflate the ego completely and then identify with the entire &lt;br&gt;univ=\r\nerse, instead of a single entity with a single agenda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp=\r\n; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IDENTIFYING CONDITION=\r\nING&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determi=\r\nnes our &lt;br&gt;likes,\n dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or =\r\ndislike) &lt;br&gt;some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some=\r\n things &lt;br&gt;though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to d=\r\no) those &lt;br&gt;things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accum=\r\nulated &lt;br&gt;over many lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone praises us, we may know tha=\r\nt it is irrelevant (our inner &lt;br&gt;voice tells us so) and yet we may feel el=\r\nated. When someone puts us &lt;br&gt;down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our=\r\n inner voice tells us so) &lt;br&gt;and yet we may feel offended and feel like do=\r\ning something about it. All &lt;br&gt;this comes from conditioning, which has bee=\r\nn accumulated over many &lt;br&gt;lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-46&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Idnetifying&lt;/span&gt; the conditioning as it works on our instincts, th=\r\noughts, &lt;br&gt;calculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible=\r\n. The key &lt;br&gt;is to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whene=\r\nver the\n &lt;br&gt;inner voice of conscience is telling us one\n thing and we are =\r\nimpelled &lt;br&gt;from inside to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the =\r\nwork of &lt;br&gt;conditioning. We often suppress the inner voice of conscience a=\r\nnd obey &lt;br&gt;the inner voice of our conditioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we are engaging =\r\nin fewer and/or smaller actions - physical or mental &lt;br&gt;- that go against =\r\nthe inner voice of conscience, it means our &lt;br&gt;conditioning is becoming li=\r\nghter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of &lt;br&gt;spiritual progress. This =\r\nmay in general be difficult for others to &lt;br&gt;judge, but one can certainly =\r\njudge for oneself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tricky thing is that our self-analysis and se=\r\nlf-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-47&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;judgment&lt;/span&gt; is also &lt;br&gt;cont=\r\nrolled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against &lt;br&gt;my =\r\ninner voice. Suppose I want to &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-48&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;anal=\r\nyze&lt;/span&gt; what just happened and whether &lt;br&gt;I violated my inner voice of =\r\nconscience. That whole process is governed &lt;br&gt;by the\n conditioning too. De=\r\npending on how deeply I am conditioned to &lt;br&gt;think that I am a good\n perso=\r\nn doing the right thing and not making a &lt;br&gt;mistake, my mind will be impel=\r\nled to label the inner voice of conscience &lt;br&gt;as a voice of confusion and =\r\nnot accord it any importance. Instead, it &lt;br&gt;will focus on the inner voice=\r\n of conditioning (which shouts out from &lt;br&gt;inside the reasons that justify=\r\n the action!) and conclude that I did the &lt;br&gt;right thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The grip =\r\nof conditioning is too tight to overcome in a day or two! But, &lt;br&gt;the inne=\r\nr voice of conscience does tell everyone when one is doing &lt;br&gt;something wr=\r\nong under the influence of conditioning. If one keeps &lt;br&gt;trying, it can &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;misspell-49&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;oneday&lt;/span&gt; help one identify and o=\r\nvercome conditioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SPECIAL EXPERIENCES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, as one makes spi=\r\nritual progress, one may have super-normal or &lt;br&gt;mystical or out-of-body e=\r\nxperiences, visions and dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, one person I\n know star=\r\nted to feel very light in the head\n &lt;br&gt;with a vision of bright light of a =\r\nparticular &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-50&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;, when he me=\r\nditated &lt;br&gt;with a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a bi=\r\ng fire at &lt;br&gt;the base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (=\r\nhe actually &lt;br&gt;felt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific man=\r\ntra. Another &lt;br&gt;person saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity ta=\r\nlked to him. &lt;br&gt;Interestingly, the same deity was seen by another person w=\r\nho was also &lt;br&gt;sitting there at the same time and that person had a totall=\r\ny different &lt;br&gt;(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity =\r\nat the same &lt;br&gt;time. Another person felt like he became very light and was=\r\n floating in &lt;br&gt;air and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another c=\r\nase, one &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-51&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhaka&lt;/span&gt; when me=\r\nditating was filled with the sense that his job was done &lt;br&gt;on earth and h=\r\ne could now leave. He thought, &quot;let\n me leave and let me &lt;br&gt;take some more=\r\n with me&quot;. He felt like he was a point moving up\n with a &lt;br&gt;tremendous spe=\r\ned. At the same time, another person who was meditating a &lt;br&gt;few feet away=\r\n in front of a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-52&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt; fire fe=\r\nlt like somebody was pulling &lt;br&gt;that person forcibly through a cave and fe=\r\nlt really overwhelmed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are so many possible experiences. But t=\r\nhe key point is that &lt;br&gt;experiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESS=\r\nARY NOR SUFFICIENT for &lt;br&gt;spiritual progress. I had my share of experience=\r\ns, progress and setbacks &lt;br&gt;and I am 100% sure of the above. You&#39;ll do wel=\r\nl to remember this &lt;br&gt;sentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences=\r\n or desire them &lt;br&gt;consciously or sub-consciously. I will &lt;span id=3D&quot;miss=\r\npell-53&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;elabate&lt;/span&gt; a little later on the &lt;br&gt;grave dang=\r\ners of desiring experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We =\r\nsay that god can be known only by experience and\n not by reading &lt;br&gt;books.=\r\n That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous\n of an &lt;br&gt;exp=\r\nerience, one may experience an aspect of god&#39;s &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-54&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Delusory&lt;/span&gt; Power instead &lt;br&gt;of god and that may increase =\r\nfalse pride (a true experience of god will &lt;br&gt;instead produce infinite hum=\r\nility). Not all experiences are equal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a famous quote: An o=\r\nunce of experience is better than a ton of &lt;br&gt;theory. Though that is true =\r\nin a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of &lt;br&gt;experience is useless if pr=\r\noduces a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-55&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;quintal&lt;/span&gt; of ego. Ins=\r\ntead, a ton of &lt;br&gt;theory may actually be better if it actually reduces &lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-56&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; ego to a &lt;br&gt;pound or an =\r\nounce!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The issue is not whether one needs practical experience or th=\r\neoretical &lt;br&gt;understanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what i=\r\ns happening &lt;br&gt;to &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-57&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; ego=\r\n. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubtedly &lt;br&gt;the main\n iss=\r\nue. If reading books, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-58&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;satsanga&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;, rituals, theoretical &lt;br&gt;understanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a &lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;misspell-59&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;quintal&lt;/span&gt;, from a &lt;span id=3D&quot;m=\r\nisspell-60&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;quintal&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;br&gt;a pound and from a pound t=\r\no an\n ounce, even without a direct experience, &lt;br&gt;that&#39;s awesome. That is =\r\nbetter than getting a ton of experience and ego &lt;br&gt;being inflated from a p=\r\nound to a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-61&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;quintal&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\nough it is true that ego does not become complete zero without an &lt;br&gt;&quot;expe=\r\nrience&quot; of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that &lt;br&gt;&quot;experie=\r\nnce&quot; when &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-62&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; ego is still=\r\n a ton or a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-63&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;quintal&lt;/span&gt;. First r=\r\neduce it &lt;br&gt;to as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then=\r\n come by &lt;br&gt;itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is=\r\n a nice line: &quot;Don&#39;t &lt;br&gt;chase success, but chase capability. Success will =\r\nfollow automatically.&quot; &lt;br&gt;Similarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase de=\r\ntachment and deflation &lt;br&gt;of ego. Experience will automatically follow. Ch=\r\nasing experience without &lt;br&gt;trying to reduce ego is like putting the cart =\r\nbefore the\n horse. To use &lt;br&gt;the analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one th=\r\nen runs the risk of &lt;br&gt;becoming the spiritual equivalent of\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;m=\r\nisspell-64&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Chatur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-65&quot; class=3D&quot;=\r\nmark&quot;&gt;Ramalingam&lt;/span&gt; (alias Silencer) &lt;br&gt;of that movie, who chased succ=\r\ness, ended up with huge ego from limited &lt;br&gt;success and failed in the end!=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As said above, it is a bad idea to seek =\r\nan &quot;experience&quot; when &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-66&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; e=\r\ngo &lt;br&gt;is still a ton or a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-67&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;quintal&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;. In other words, when &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-68&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;=\r\n/span&gt; conditioning is &lt;br&gt;dense enough, a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-69&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;-occupation with experiences can be &lt;br&gt;counter-product=\r\nive. The reason is that any experience will be &lt;br&gt;interpreted (and absorbe=\r\nd into &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-70&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; system!!!) thro=\r\nugh the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-71&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;br&gt;&lt;span\n =\r\nid=3D&quot;misspell-72&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; conditioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I go=\r\n into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see &lt;br&gt;that Sun=\r\n is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-73&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;colored&lt;/span&gt; glass &lt;br&gt;windows of a house. Or suppose I go int=\r\no the open, but see Sun through &lt;br&gt;green eyeglasses. In either case, I wil=\r\nl see that Sun is green. I am &lt;br&gt;experiencing the real Sun, but I will get=\r\n\n the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun &lt;br&gt;is green&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, even a gen=\r\nuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN &lt;br&gt;generate false knowled=\r\nge (e.g. Sun is green!) if &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-74&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; conditioning is &lt;br&gt;conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key=\r\n is not just to experience, but the ability to &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-75&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;interpet&lt;/span&gt;, *digest* &lt;br&gt;and absorb the experience into &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;misspell-76&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; system well. &lt;span id=3D=\r\n&quot;misspell-77&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;One&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; conditioning &lt;br&gt;influences how o=\r\nne digests various life experiences, including spiritual &lt;br&gt;experiences an=\r\nd mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the &lt;br&gt;above example=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-78&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;=\r\n&gt;ayurvedic&lt;/span&gt; terms, food one cannot digest well becomes &lt;span id=3D&quot;mi=\r\nsspell-79&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt;, a toxic &lt;br&gt;buildup in the system. I=\r\nt can slowly build up, get absorbed into various &lt;br&gt;tissues and create var=\r\nious diseases. In the beginning, one may look and &lt;br&gt;feel healthy despite =\r\nsome &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-80&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt;, but, when too much=\r\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-81&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; accumulates, one\n &lt;br&gt;d=\r\nevelops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts &lt;br=\r\n&gt;of the body. The &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-82&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; may ev=\r\nen interfere with the digestion of good food &lt;br&gt;being taken in and the wor=\r\nking of even medicines one may take in. When &lt;br&gt;too much &lt;span id=3D&quot;missp=\r\nell-83&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; has accumulated and &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-=\r\n84&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;destabilizes&lt;/span&gt; the system, one may need &lt;br&gt;to go t=\r\nhrough a painful &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-85&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;de&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-86&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;toxification&lt;/span&gt; process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similar=\r\nly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual &lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n id=3D&quot;misspell-87&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt;, a toxic buildup in the subtl=\r\ne system. It can slowly build up, get &lt;br&gt;absorbed into various aspects of =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-88&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; being and create vario=\r\nus diseases &lt;br&gt;in the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and fe=\r\nel\n &lt;br&gt;spiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritu=\r\nal &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-89&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; accumulates, one =\r\ndevelops serious spirituality disorders. It can &lt;br&gt;eventually affect &lt;span=\r\n id=3D&quot;misspell-90&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; entire being. The spiritual=\r\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-91&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pancha&lt;/span&gt;-karma (for &lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n id=3D&quot;misspell-92&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;de&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-93&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;toxification&lt;/span&gt;) may be far more difficult than the physical\n=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-94&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pancha&lt;/span&gt;-karma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXPERIENCE=\r\nS OR DELUSIONS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To illustrate what I mean by spiritual &lt;span id=3D&quot;mi=\r\nsspell-95&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; and delusions, let me give a &lt;br&gt;*hypo=\r\nthetical* example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suppose someone sits still for a few hours everyd=\r\nay and meditates. &lt;br&gt;Suppose one starts to get some special inner experien=\r\nces and some &lt;br&gt;seemingly supernatural things start happening externally a=\r\nround one. &lt;br&gt;Suppose these experiences give one the impression that one i=\r\ns special &lt;br&gt;and one is making excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one r=\r\neads some &lt;br&gt;spiritual books and &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-96&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;f=\r\nantasizes&lt;/span&gt; &quot;becoming like Shiva&quot; mentioned in those &lt;br&gt;books. Then o=\r\nne may start to think &quot;may be, I have become like Shiva&quot; &lt;br&gt;and slowly con=\r\nvince oneself that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one &lt;br&gt;reads a spiri=\r\ntual\n book that claims &quot;If one becomes like Shiva, the whole &lt;br&gt;universe c=\r\nonnives against one who causes an &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-97&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;o=\r\nffense&lt;/span&gt; to him&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of\n course, there is a context behind every s=\r\ntatement and no statement is &lt;br&gt;absolute. If one misses the nuances, one m=\r\nay digest and absorb it into &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-98&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;on=\r\ne&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said, &quot;if one=\r\n &lt;br&gt;becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one and =\r\n&lt;br&gt;there is no way anyone can really cause &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-99&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;offense&lt;/span&gt; to that person&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, one in the process=\r\n of convincing oneself that one has indeed &lt;br&gt;become like Shiva may then l=\r\nook for examples of someone causing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-100&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;offense&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;and suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can f=\r\nind any shapes in &lt;br&gt;clouds, one can find any correlations in things happe=\r\nning around one. &lt;br&gt;One will find a few examples. That may reinforce the d=\r\nelusion that one &lt;br&gt;has become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to peo=\r\nple around one, &lt;br&gt;one may start\n correlating them to good and bad done by=\r\n those people to &lt;br&gt;one and/or to things one has done. Over time, the delu=\r\nsion may become so\n &lt;br&gt;deep that it just feels so natural and obvious. Thi=\r\ns is like a serious &lt;br&gt;disease developing from a toxic buildup of undigest=\r\ned or badly digested &lt;br&gt;food. Inability to fully understand the spiritual =\r\nexperiences one had, &lt;br&gt;the fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-101&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-102&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;exising&lt;/span&gt; pride (like &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-103&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;-existing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-104&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;) and the not-so-well-digested notion that &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-105&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;offense&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;br&gt;Shiva causes harm, have together created =\r\nspiritual &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-106&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; buildup that =\r\nnow &lt;br&gt;resulted in a serious disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though original experiences m=\r\nay have been genuine, experiences coming &lt;br&gt;later on MAY be the result of =\r\naccumulated delusions (disease) from the &lt;br&gt;ill-digested experiences and n=\r\notions (&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-107&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt;). Please note =\r\nthat &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-108&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;br&gt;conducive t=\r\no creating more &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-109&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt;. When u=\r\nnchecked, disease in one part of &lt;br&gt;the system can spread to others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;As said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or &lt;br&gt;defl=\r\nated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track.\n &lt;br&gt;One =\r\nis either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due &lt;br&gt;to =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-110&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;-existing conditioning a=\r\nnd delusions (spiritual &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-111&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ama&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n). In either &lt;br&gt;case, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested w=\r\nell and is &lt;br&gt;weakening the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the=\r\n other hand, &lt;br&gt;ego is getting deflated, then one is on the right track. W=\r\nhatever one is &lt;br&gt;experiencing is being digested well and strengthening th=\r\ne system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-112&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;SHAKTI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-113&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;SIDDHIS&lt;/span&gt; AND MIRACLES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This em=\r\nphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder about the &lt;br&gt;prominenc=\r\ne given in some books to accumulation of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-114&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shakti&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-115&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;siddhis&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt; and\n &lt;br&gt;miracles. For example, some books describe what a being like Sh=\r\niva or &lt;br&gt;someone less but still with high enough &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-116=\r\n&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shakti&lt;/span&gt;, can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, SOME enlightened beings=\r\n or some beings close to enlightenment MAY &lt;br&gt;have a lot of spiritual &lt;spa=\r\nn id=3D&quot;misspell-117&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shakti&lt;/span&gt; and be able to do\n some =\r\nspecial things. &lt;br&gt;But, no book said that you get those abilities by being=\r\n proud or &lt;br&gt;pursuing something that can make one proud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, i=\r\nf one looks at those abilities described in books and adores &lt;br&gt;them from =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-118&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; *current* levels of d=\r\nense conditioning, it is quite akin &lt;br&gt;to looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from gr=\r\neen eyeglasses and admiring the &lt;br&gt;greenness of that Sun!!! In other words=\r\n, one has missed the whole point. &lt;br&gt;One with dense conditioning can&#39;t eve=\r\nn understand what that &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-119&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shakti&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt; or &lt;br&gt;ability really means or comes from. In order to understand what &lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;misspell-120&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shakti&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;is, to accumulate=\r\n enough &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-121&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shakti&lt;/span&gt; or to reach =\r\nsuch a state, one MUST &lt;br&gt;deflate &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-122&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;=\r\n&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; ego.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-123&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Bottomli=\r\nne&lt;/span&gt;\n is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous in &lt;br&gt;=\r\nteaching the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No &lt;br&gt;s=\r\ncripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It&#39;s as &lt;br&gt;simp=\r\nle as that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbs=\r\np; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS &amp; CONVERSATIONS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We encounte=\r\nr some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses &lt;br&gt;and also =\r\nconversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime &lt;br&gt;coming f=\r\nrom the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine &lt;br&gt;beings s=\r\nupposedly said is well within what one consciously or &lt;br&gt;sub-consciously a=\r\nlready knew or believed or wanted to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This may remind one of=\r\n the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character &lt;br&gt;played by &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-124&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sanjay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-125&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Dutt&lt;/span&gt; in hit &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-126&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;bo=\r\nllywood&lt;/span&gt; movie &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-127&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Lage&lt;/span&gt; =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-128&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Rahe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-1=\r\n29&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Munnabhai&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. In &lt;br&gt;that movie, the visions are du=\r\ne to &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-130&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Munn=\r\nabhai&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;mind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answ=\r\ner questions &lt;br&gt;that &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-131&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Munnabhai&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So &lt;br&gt;the conclu=\r\nsion is that the person &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-132&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Munnabhai&lt;=\r\n/span&gt; imagines seeing is a &lt;br&gt;character in his own mind constructed based=\r\n on what &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-133&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Munnabhai&lt;/span&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;und=\r\nerstands of Gandhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the case of divine encounters, it may be a li=\r\nttle different from this &lt;br&gt;movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fanc=\r\nied meeting based on all &lt;br&gt;that one consciously and sub-consciously knew =\r\nalready, OR it may be a &lt;br&gt;real being. Even in the latter case, the being =\r\nand his/her actions are &lt;br&gt;interpreted strictly based on &lt;span id=3D&quot;missp=\r\nell-134&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; conditioning, like the &quot;green Sun&quot; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;in our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine &lt;br&gt;bei=\r\nngs say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or &lt;br&gt;sub-=\r\nconsciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the ra=\r\nre case of a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-135&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhaka&lt;/span&gt; with v=\r\nery little conditioning having a &lt;br&gt;real divine encounter, it is like an i=\r\nnnocent child meeting mother or &lt;br&gt;father, and there is a real flow of div=\r\nine and sublime understanding and &lt;br&gt;wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, the key\n is not=\r\n to see a god or a goddess, but to be &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-136&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;de&lt;/span&gt;-conditioned enough to really benefit\n from it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*=\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-137&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;KUNDALINI&lt;/span&gt; AWAKENING &amp; RISE&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;One more thing people often talk about is &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-138&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Kundalini&lt;/span&gt; awakening and rise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-13=\r\n9&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Kundalini&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-140&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;=\r\n&gt;shakti&lt;/span&gt; is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this &lt;br&gt;is=\r\n &quot;I&quot;). &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-141&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Kundalini&lt;/span&gt; being asle=\r\nep in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-142&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mooladhara&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-143&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;chakra&lt;/span&gt; means one does not &lt;br&gt;even =\r\nquestion who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties &lt;br&gt;sel=\r\nf down to the physical body and physical senses. However, &lt;br&gt;self-awarenes=\r\ns rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual &lt;br&gt;progress or enl=\r\nightenment. &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-144&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Kundalini&lt;/span&gt; awake=\r\nning is\n only the beginning of &lt;\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
