Let us please leave out the superficial =\r\nthings.\n\nIn general, I encourage people to do serious sadhana, but I also \n=\r\nurge them\nto constantly contemplate one&#39;s thoughts, motives and actions and=\r\n\nconsciously try to improve self-control. Serious sadhana tends to \nbring\nt=\r\nhose changes internally, but it can still take a long time. There \nare some=\r\n\nwho do serious sadhana for years and yet stuck in the quicksand of \nego. Y=\r\nes,\nego IS a quicksand. Getting out is very very tough.\n\nContemplation and =\r\nconscious effort to overcome ego should go in \nparallel to\nthe &quot;severe sadh=\r\nana&quot;. In fact, I see them as much as a part of one&#39;s \nsadhana\nas the extern=\r\nal rituals, practices and meditation.\n\nWithout a conscious effort to weed o=\r\nut ego, even serious sadhana can \ncause\npride in one and make one fall. Per=\r\nhaps nobody exists today who can \ndo more\nsevere sadhana than Ravana. But, =\r\ndespite such severe penances, \nRavana was\nnot immune to pride and he fell.\n=\r\n]\n\n***\n\nI know our praises will not harm him becuase he has moved to much \n=\r\nsafer orbit.\n\nSpiritually yours,\n\nUtpal\n\nSadhana makes things easier on the=\r\n effort to overcome ego, but does \nnot\nguarantee anything. One needs to sup=\r\nplement sadhana with a conscious \neffort\nto overcome ego.\n \n\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; \n&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve some recent pictures (around 1 year back) of Narasimha. what \n=\r\ni \n&gt; felt that his face in those pics looked tired and exhausted. I \ntold \n=\r\n&gt; myself that it is surely due to the amount of stress, his body \nmust \n&gt; h=\r\nave gone thro&#39; because of tremendous Sadhanaas he has performed \nin \n&gt; rece=\r\nnt years.\n&gt; \n&gt; like you all noticed, i was also pleasently surprised to see=\r\n \n&gt; the &#39;Glowing Face&#39; of his in the video when i saw it for the first \n&gt; t=\r\nime day before yesterday. actually i was very happy to see his \n&gt; shining f=\r\nace in that video.\n&gt; BUT it hardly matters to me if his face is shining or =\r\nlusterless. \nTo \n&gt; be honest, Even his knowledge has not impressed me that =\r\nmuch \nbecause \n&gt; You&#39;ll find great many &#39;Orators&#39; and philosophical lacture=\r\nrs. even \ni \n&gt; can give a good philosophical lacture. it may not be a big d=\r\neal \nnow \n&gt; a days. What has really impressed me is his attitude of engagin=\r\ng \n&gt; into practical Sadhanaas. He has inspired me with his \ndemonstration \n=\r\n&gt; of doing Sadhanaas. His steadfastness in putting long hours for \nGod. \n&gt; =\r\n32 chandi Homas in 3 days is not a joke. He is very very serious \nin \n&gt; his=\r\n quest for Realisation and THAT is the thing which inspires me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm R=\r\negards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Padmaja Sun=\r\nchu \n&gt; &lt;padmaja.sunchu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Om Vishnave Namah\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namasthe=\r\n Mitesh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Its a coincidence that I too was thinking of the same, whe=\r\nn I \n&gt; first saw the\n&gt; &gt; video.\n&gt; &gt; I had met Sri Narasimha garu in August =\r\n2006 at the SJC West Coast\n&gt; &gt; Conference,\n&gt; &gt; and I see a lustre in his fa=\r\nce now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Srinivasa\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 6, 2009 at 7:21 AM, m540i98=\r\n &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The video is very good,=\r\n Good work by the video grapher and \n&gt; Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a pleasure w=\r\natching it and I feel that I will watch it \na \n&gt; few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more times.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most importantly I want to bring out the fact that when one \ndoes \n=\r\n&gt; a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; japams and homams, the good work is reflected in the persons =\r\n\n&gt; face,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lustre etc. Although I have not met Narasimha ever, I ha=\r\nve \n&gt; seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one picture of him may be from many years ago and now the =\r\n\nvideo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a striking difference between the two.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe transformation internally may be more intense and \nfantanstic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; On a different note, I have heard from a very realized soul \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks is \n&gt; reserved\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; for them, it is not advisible for people like us married or \n&gt; single t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; put it on.
