It inspired me to follow my intuition and setup my own saadhana r=\r\noutine. \n\nI&#39;ve recently started (just a month ago) meditating on different =\r\nmantras, homam and tarpana. I thoroughly enjoyed this thread and as it refl=\r\nects some of my own doubts. I&#39;ve not had any experiences but I am a lot cal=\r\nmer and happy after i started. \n\nHere are a few things I&#39;m doing:\n1. Rising=\r\n up early before sunrise (as compared to 3-4 hours after sun rise)\n2. Doing=\r\n pranayam, suryanamaskar, kapaal bhaanti - all learn from youtube videos (t=\r\nhough i have some previous knowledge)\n3. Doing Ram-raksha strotram and Gana=\r\npati homam and some other strotras that i like in &#39;Nitya Karma Pooja Prakas=\r\nh&#39; from geeta press.  \n4. Following close to satvik diet (least oil, spices=\r\n) only self cooked no outside food. (This is all to aid in saadhana).  \n\nIf=\r\n one you fellow sadhakas or gurus have any tips or comments, I&#39;d be obliged=\r\n. \n\nThanks everyone. \nMay parampita bless us all. Hari Aum! \n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shoonyakaya&quot; &lt;shoonyakaya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I totally=\r\n agree with Vishal & Rajarshi... Even i started my sadhana with the same qu=\r\nestion in mind. \n&gt; \n&gt; Follow rules or not, my take on it is follow your int=\r\nuition. Then the question arises how to differentiate between intuition and=\r\n wishful thinking? (even i am looking for an answer)\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not to follow=\r\n rules?\n&gt; One might not at all begin his/her sadhana thinking of rules. Sad=\r\nhana has to be tailored with the normal life till one finds a rythm and con=\r\nfidence. Then the rules will be automatically followed based on the serious=\r\nness of the sadhak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why to follow rules?\n&gt; As pointed out by Rajarshi,=\r\n the chandipath had so strict rules may be because of the following reason:=\r\n\n&gt; 1. Some sadhanas give immediate heightened awareness to the sadhak. It m=\r\neans they can smell, taste, hear and see better than normal. The world all =\r\nof a sudden starts looking beautiful.\n&gt; 2. They can visualize better the de=\r\ntails of everything and every being and get lucid dreams.\n&gt; 3. Normal peopl=\r\ne are naturally attracted to the sadhak because of his/her composure and gr=\r\nace and there is a beauty in the way they walk and talk that attracts\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe downfall:\n&gt; Despite these changes, one thing would still remain...the &quot;=\r\nVasanas&quot; which is a biggest obstacle to any sadhak. The normal world has ma=\r\nny trigger points for vasanas which would entice the sadhak and make him lo=\r\nse control over his self. For a male sadhak women would look extraordinaril=\r\ny beautiful and start dreaming about them. Their voice, their actions, thei=\r\nr laughter would haunt them day n night. Because people are attracted towar=\r\nds sadhak, it boosts his ego and he/she forgets the very basic dharmas of l=\r\nife. All this is not the purpose of sadhana and hence the siddhas of past r=\r\necommended seclueded life which protects sadhaka from triggering the vasana=\r\ns before he attains maturity.\n&gt; The first 2 sadhanas (mentioned below)thoug=\r\nh very simple, gave me the experience explained above (including the downfa=\r\nll).\n&gt; Self-awareness at every waking moment (sometimes sleeping moment als=\r\no) becomes very essential to prevent downfall. I cannot put in words the im=\r\nportance of swadhyava (self-study)and Ishvara pranidhana (surrender to divi=\r\nne)in this sense. Maybe mantra jap all day long is a good idea (as also sug=\r\ngested in Vignyan Bhairava Tantra)\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhana Krama i followed:\n&gt; 1. jog =\r\nfor a kilometer and do Sudarshana Kriya\n&gt; 2. jog for a kilometer or more an=\r\nd chant long OM and contemplate on the after-silence\n&gt; 3. Jap of moolamantr=\r\nas of navagrahas\n&gt; 4. Bandhas as given in Shiva Samhita\n&gt; 5. Sooryanamaskar=\r\n and Gayathri Sahasranam Jap (current)\n&gt; \n&gt; The saying: An old patient is b=\r\netter than the new doctor. I have only presented my view (with some experie=\r\nnce)even though i am only a beginner in this path so your guidance will be =\r\nhelpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Om tat sat\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
