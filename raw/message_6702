Fierce deities like Chandi can indeed cause some=\r\n disturbances \n&gt; &gt; in material life. Though it is for good in the long run,=\r\n it can be \n&gt; &gt; uncomfortable until things settle down. If you stick to Mah=\r\naganapathi, \n&gt; &gt; things will be more controlled, measured and balanced. The=\r\n high voltage \n&gt; &gt; of Chandi may or may not be digestible to all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHowever, interestingly, a lot of good people who used to be laymen in \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nspiritual matters 5 years back are doing regular Chandi homam now. This \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; is honestly quite amazing and should have an impact on dharma in the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stick to Mahaganapathi homam for a few months atleast, bef=\r\nore \n&gt; &gt; considering something else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do not ask for specific resul=\r\nts and let god decide the best for you.

When I told my father that I purchased kundalam for \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; doing homam he was little uncomfortable about me doing it without \n&gt; &gt; fo=\r\nllowing right procedures. I think, he is afraid that something might \n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nappen to me, so I shared homam information by Narasimha Rao ji as well \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n but he said not to do Chandi homam by myself. I am planning to start Sri \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Maha Ganapathi Homam over the weekend.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Aravind\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
