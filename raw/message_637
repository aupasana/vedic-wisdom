Sri Yogeshwar was a very highly\nrealized saint. His book i=\r\ns very good. He does mention about his\nprevoius birth and also mentions tha=\r\nt Saccha Baba had also confirmed\nthe same thing. Saccha Baba was another ve=\r\nry highly realized saint too.\n\nSri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai =\r\nBaba of shirdi and Naamdev\nand also many other saints too. The initiation h=\r\ne got on the bank of\nriver Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has descri=\r\nbed very\naccurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. He =\r\nhad\nvery good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantastic\nora=\r\ntor. His followers have done a very good job of putting up the web\nsite and=\r\n sharing the information for free both audio and books.\n\nChiti Leela or the=\r\n play of Shakti or God is very complex, Ramakrishna\nmay have taken birth as=\r\n more than one person and in future may take\nmore births.\n\nHis comsic body =\r\n(karan sharir) or whatever name others use pardon my\nlack of appropriate wo=\r\nrd, is also alive and manifest from time to time\nAfter reading this and oth=\r\ner books, I feel that each one of us has a\ninner guru along with our atma a=\r\nnd this inner guru in conjunction with\nour accumulated or sanchit sankaras =\r\ngive us visions of these mahatmas\nor help us attach or attract to a Saint o=\r\nr some aspects of the saint\nmore than others. This inner guru is the same i=\r\nn all humam beings but\nmanifests uniquely based on each person. \n\nI also be=\r\nlieve that one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is\npresent in physical =\r\nform and seek guidance from him time to time.\nThere are many instances of o=\r\nther forms of inititations like\ninitiation in dream or inititation by cosmi=\r\nc forms, these forms of\ninitiations though very important are very rare or =\r\nuncommon.\n\nAfter reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up i=\r\nn my\nmind about him.\n\n1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have=\r\n guided many\nspiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique=\r\n.\n2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book\nabou=\r\nt it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after that?\n3) He di=\r\nd pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving\nspirtual talks=\r\n? It seems unusual.\n\nI have also read somewhere that once a person reaches =\r\na spiritual\nstate, he cannot remain in human body for more than few days, w=\r\nas this\nthe case?\n\nMay be others who have read this book can share more lig=\r\nht.\nI do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read this book if one has\n=\r\ntime, it is available for free to download as a pdf book on his web site.\n\n=\r\nSri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment and\nupliftmen=\r\nt, a lot of his information is wellknown.

This is an unbelievable experience that I\n&gt; &gt; have=\r\n had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing \n&gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; as=\r\n was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of \n&gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nKindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nwas working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near \n&gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; My=\r\n duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; offic=\r\ne and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some \n&gt; Telephone\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nas working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking \n&gt; abou=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly \n&gt; gatherin=\r\ng at\n&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created =\r\n\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nKathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly \n&gt; meeting\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\nn. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt; &gt; and we=\r\nre talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he su=\r\nddenly told me--\n&gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home =\r\nand my wife is remembering me. My \n&gt; son\n&gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to =\r\ncall me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; And with my surprise hi=\r\ns 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told =\r\nme that there will be a plane \n&gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened.=\r\n I was very much impressed about \n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. O=\r\nne day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, \n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; told me not to go through bu=\r\ns, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did=\r\n not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprisi=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super \n&gt; p=\r\nower\n&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered \n&gt; myself\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed \n=\r\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his =\r\n\n&gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 m=\r\norning\n&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was \n&gt;=\r\n waking\n&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I hav=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and \n&gt;=\r\n she\n&gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you t=\r\nake such a hasty \n&gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Ma=\r\na Kali at Calcutta. He \n&gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be livi=\r\nng one, who can guide us, \n&gt; give\n&gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take D=\r\nixa from Shri Ram Sharma \n&gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=\r\n=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in gener=\r\nal not \n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I =\r\nhave taken\n&gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\nir disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to\n&gt; &gt; test T=\r\nhakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr.=\r\n Patel \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He ha=\r\ns never \n&gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to o=\r\nur house \n&gt; within\n&gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selectio=\r\nn for Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=EF=BF=BD=EF=\r\n=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-\n&gt; -\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndecision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence \n&gt; ev=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; today.=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my hom=\r\ne at 06.30 in the\n&gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=\r\n=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; &gt; Yeste=\r\nrday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; &gt; mornings=\r\n today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours.

This is an unbelievable experience that I&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; exactly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to\n t=\r\nhe period of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you =\r\nare in religious mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wor=\r\nking as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opp=\r\nosite to Post&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had frie=\r\nndship with some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbh=\r\nai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was working as Opera=\r\ntor. He was a staunch devotee of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramkri=\r\nshnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; about&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; gathering at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devot=\r\nional songs created &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him and was weeping while\n sin=\r\nging. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngs=\r\nters were attending this weekly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on Saturday e=\r\nvening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then. We =\r\nwere used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and=\r\n were talking only about Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at =\r\nsea shore he suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; so=\r\nme guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My &lt;BR&gt;&gt; so=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go no=\r\nw=E2=80=9D. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old s=\r\non came to call him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me =\r\nthat there will be a plane &lt;BR&gt;&gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tomorrow and that al=\r\nso happened. I was very much impressed about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He =\r\ncould foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n h=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured=\r\n. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka a=\r\ns was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only.=\r\n I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should a=\r\nlso be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/19=\r\n74. At 7 pm I surrendered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Pat=\r\nel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n grace. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife=\r\n at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start=\r\n from 7 am I was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told\n t=\r\no my wife in the morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnad=\r\nev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; argued =\r\nwith me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; decision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa=\r\n Kali at Calcutta. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru =\r\nshould be living one, who can guide us, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; us Mantr=\r\na etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\ner arguments were right at her place as people in general not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; know=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have =\r\ntaken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was=\r\n telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I a=\r\nlso decided\n to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =\r\n=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel &lt;BR&gt;&gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never =\r\ncome to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never &lt;BR&gt;&gt; asked&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my se=\r\nlection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sh=\r\ne laughed at me=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=\r\n=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to=\r\n send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decision and convinc=\r\ne my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence &lt;BR&gt;&gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; today.=E2=80=99&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at=\r\n my home at 06.30 in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told=\r\n?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you kno=\r\nw what happened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just co=\r\nme\n to my home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for =\r\n1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me th=\r\nat-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; house. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is=\r\n waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; house=\r\n=E2=80=9D&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was g=\r\nuiding me the way &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. W=\r\nhat you want? Why you are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; disturbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him in such an e=\r\narly morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We both we=\r\nre so excited and surprised that we had no words that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Morning.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my=\r\n life. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about =\r\nShri Thakur but I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it sometime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; earth.
