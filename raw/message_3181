Either is fine. Though northeast is preferred, it is not mandatory. If your homa kundam is small and you have a chance to put the kalasam inside the fireplace, that may be better. But placing it outside in another direction and closer to you is ok too.\n \n2. Some people use both sruk and sruva for ALL ghee offerings. They systematically pour ghee from sruva (small ladle) into sruk (big ladle) and then pour from sruk into fire. I skipped that in my document altogether. You were apparently taught to do that with one specific offering. You may do what you were taught. Using just one ladle/spoon and making all ghee offerings with it is also perfectly fine. More on the symbolism at the end.\n \n3. There can be a kalasam and a suddhi patra (what I called in the document as a tumbler with water). I mentioned that one can optionally have a kalasam in the northeast, invoke Varuna and do shodasopachara pooja to him in a long homam. But, in a short homam, suddhi paatra (tumbler with purifying water) and kalasam are integrated.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe fire in homa kundam is symbolic of the bhootaagni (existential fire) burning inside one,  which digests various experiences brought by the conditioning of individualized consciousness. Aajya paatra (ghee container) is symbolic of the consciousness that is individualized by conditioning. Pouring ghee in fire is symbolic of offering a past karma that conditions the individualized consciousness in a particular way, and burning it in the existential fire.\n \nSru means to flow. Sruk and sruva enable ghee to flow through them. The Ida and Pingala nadis let consciousness flow through them. Sruk or the big ladle represents Ida (female/Moon). Sruva or the small ladle represents Pingala (male/Sun). Ida is the channel of surrender, while Pingala is the channel of discrimination.\n \nOffering ghee in fire using sruva is symbolic of burning one&#39;s conditioning using the channel of discrimination. Offering ghee in fire using sruk is symbolic of burning one&#39;s conditioning using the channel of surrender. Using both sruva and sruk means using the discrimination and then surrendering due to discrimination. The conditioning passes through the channels of discrimination and surrender both.\n \n*        *        *\n \nMaking offerings in fire to a deity on a regular basis while chanting a mantra and imagining the deity in fire is the key thing and all other factors are secondary and tertiary. Not every factor is equally crucial. I suggest not worrying about too many details. One should follow the procedure one has learnt.\n \nApart from the ritual, learn to discriminate and surrender. Discriminate - do not mix up real things that matter and temporary things that matter not. Surrender - realize that god is the master and we are temporary caretakers of everything in our possession, including relatives, properties , name, fame, image and even body. If various aspects of mental conditioning that give rise to certain thoughts, experiences, actions etc are flown through the channels of discrimination and also surrender, and then burnt, one becomes eventually free, ritual or no ritual. Even a simple ritual of homam can eventually stimulate this process.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sri Narasimha Garu, \n&gt;  \n&gt; I was able to perform the Homam last couple of sundays and plan to practise it as often as I could. Now some more questions. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Your document says that the Kalasam should be established to the North East of the HomaKundam. My fireplace is situated on the eastern side of the house and I will be facing east as I sit, just like how it is preferred. My homakundam is small enough that I can establish the Kalasam also within the fire-place to the North East of the Homa Kundam and The Ganapathi Idol also right in front of the Kalasam, within the fireplace. Is it okay to do it this way or should the Kalasam and Ganapathi Idol should be out side of the fire-place? If they should be outside, then there is no way the Kalasam could be to the North East if the HomaKundam. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. In the poorvagam (preliminary offering) on page 17, the second mantra, &quot;Om Indraya Swaha! IndrayEdam Namama&quot; should be done pouring the ghee from the SouthWest to NorthEast, according to the document. This should be done with the Shruk (Big Spoon) according to the system that I learnt for our Sharmaji. Other than this, everywhere else I am just using the small spoon only, even in that system. I did not know that these (Shruk and Shruvam) are representing the male and female elements. Can you shed more light on the subject, as to what is the inner meaning of using these two spoons etc? \n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. One other small aspect that I noticed is there is a certain kriya where the water in the Shuddi Patra should be pushed from west to east (three times) with the pavitram and pavitram is eventually made knot-free and put in the fire after dipping in the ghee. This is something I did not find in your document. Could you please explain the meaning of this and why this was skipped in the document. In fact, your document does not mention the suddhi patra separately other than the Kalasam. Or is it that the Kalasam and the Shuddhi Patra are same? I am a bit confused. The Shuddi patra, the Aajya Patra, the Shruk and Shruvam make it Chatushpatra Prayogam, as I understand. Is there a different name for the prayogam that you documented? I know you tried to simplify the whole thing, but anyway, if I understand these finer aspects, I feel better. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I hope you will be willing to answer these simple questions and if not, please let me know why not! \n&gt; \n&gt; With Regards, \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Nagraj\n\n\n"}}
