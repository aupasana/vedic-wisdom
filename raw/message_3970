If 45 minu=\r\nte is long time, sometimes, and you wish to do Homam in 25 minutes then it =\r\nis a good idea to use Mantras (Poorvaangam, Aahvaahan, Main Homam, Uttarang=\r\nam etc...) given in Super short.\nIn any Homam, Most Important parts are Spe=\r\ncific Aahutis offered with Mantras of the relevant deities AND Meditation. =\r\nSo i suggest removing that thought of &#39;Lack of Satisfaction&#39; from your mind=\r\n. For improving the feeling of Contentment, It may be a good idea to select=\r\n one mantra in particular and offer it say for 21 or 54 or 108 times. IMHO,=\r\n another `Trim down&#39; version may not be a good idea. \n\nI do not know if i c=\r\nould answer you.\n\nRegards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bi=\r\nswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; NAMASKAR\n&gt; \n&gt; I seeks help on regarding =\r\nthis topic...may Rajarshi, Krishnendu, Arnab, Utpal or anyone please take m=\r\ny issue...\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards,\n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PRANAM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Na=\r\nrasimha Ji and Others,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometimes a trim down version is very usefu=\r\nl for me when there is time constraint for daily Ganapati Homam...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Currently the short-procedure takes about 45 minutes for me, yes I know th=\r\nere is a super-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sanskrit-verse a=\r\nnd sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, cou=\r\nld you please suggest/mark the various steps with important Mantras on prio=\r\nrity basis on the short-procedure of the Ganapati Homam, so that one could =\r\ntrim down the homam process in the case of time constraint but mind should =\r\nbe satisfy enough for the purpose...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Biswajit\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
