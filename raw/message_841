It creates \nwell-understood energy in the consciousness.\n \nIf one carrying a seed does not understand what it \nis for and makes a replica in gold, which in his opinion is better, one is \nlosing the basic functionality of the seed.

But my guru \n(Manish) discouraged me. He said something written by a person like me with a \ndense ego would not have the same power as a Puranic verse. The Sanskrit verses \nof Chandipath were composed by someone with a highly effaced ego and in \ncommunion with divinity. The same could be said about several sacred writings in \nmany religions in many languages. There is something special about words \ncomposed by saints, yogis and messiahs who were in a very elevated state of \nbeing, where the individual ego is effaced largely and the mind is filled with \nsome divine energy (which is not possible when individual ego occupies the space \nof mind).\n \nSo Manish told me to wait till I was ready (if \never) for such a project.

Every verse in Chandipath is a mantra and reading of  Chandipath in Sanskrit is more meaningful to please Goddess and to get desired  results. It is created in Sanskrit and whether we may follow the meaning of  the verses or not, we should read in Sanskrit only if we can read  Sanskrit fluently because every Verse has its vibrations with full of  energy.\n2. If we read in Sanskrit, we never involve  ourselves in the &#39;Lila&#39; of Durga nor we enjoy the story of Janma(Birth) of  different Shakties narrated in Chandipath  (This is only possible for  those who are scholars in Sanskrit and can translate each and every verse  immediately while reading. For others it is simply reading with faith and  devotion.)- Better way is, it should be read in regional language with full  involvement in the &#39;Lila&#39;. Here we can enjoy the different roles of Shaktis,  fully understand the differnet Births etc. This type of reading makes  Chandipath more meaningful. \nDear Sir, I request your advice as what is the real way  of chanting Sri Chandipath from these two?\nDr. Ashwin Rawal__.    \n\n\n      \r\n--0-390593527-1230780918=:33259\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Dear All,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems that this issue of doing prayers in Sanskrit or any other regional languages seems to be a recurring theme...we had a similar discussion about this a few years back, regarding chanting of Vishnu Sahasranama...here is an excerpt from that discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Recently we had a discussion about correct pronounciation and also\nabout whether to chant in sanskrit or other languages.

It is created in Sanskrit and whether we may follow the meaning of \n  the verses or not, we should read in Sanskrit &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; if we can read \n  Sanskrit fluently because every Verse has its vibrations with full of \n  energy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;system&quot;&gt;2. If we read in &lt;u&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/u&gt;, we never involve \n  ourselves in the &#39;Lila&#39; of Durga nor we enjoy the story of Janma(Birth) of \n  different Shakties narrated in Chandipath&nbsp; (This is only possible for \n  those who are scholars in Sanskrit and can translate each and every verse \n  immediately while reading. For others it is simply reading with faith and \n  devotion.)- Better way is, it should be read in regional language with full \n  involvement in the &#39;Lila&#39;. Here we can enjoy the different roles of Shaktis, \n  fully understand the differnet Births etc. This type of reading makes \n  Chandipath more meaningful. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;system&quot;&gt;Dear Sir, I request your advice as what is the real way \n  of chanting Sri Chandipath from these two?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;system&quot;&gt;Dr. Ashwin Rawal&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n\n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-390593527-1230780918=:33259--\r\n\n"}}
