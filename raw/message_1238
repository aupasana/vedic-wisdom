He referred in it a few times to the \n&quot;intellectual pygmies of Kali yuga&quot; and gave techniques suitable for \nastrologers of Kali yuga. Thus, he was conscious of impending Kali yuga and \nthat was on his in mind as he taught. In the chapters on remedial measures \nto overcome karmic problems (as represented by planets and horoscope), he \nbasically referred to various kinds of homas. Though some people may insist \non japam (meditation) today, Parasara only referred to offering mantras in \nhomam fire. He was not specific on poorvaangam (initial offerings) and \nuttaraangam (final offerings) to be used and asked to use whatever \nagnimukham (fire ritual procedure) is practiced in the family or by one&#39;s \ngurus. But he was specific on the mantras to be offered in fire for various \ndeities.\n\nObviously, Parasara did not advise japam (meditation) of various mantras and \ninstead advised homam (fire ritual) with various mantras, for a reason. He \nknew that the latter is *far more effective* in Kali yuga.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe goal of sadhana is to burn impurities in the subtle body (synonymous to \novercoming various internal enemies and weaknesses) so that energy can flow \nfreely within one&#39;s subtle body. The internal fire (bhootaagni) burning \nwithin us does this burning. When you focus your mind on a mantra, \nbhootaagni burns and starts acting.\n\nHowever, the ability of *most* people to focus the mind is highly limited. \nThe bhootaagni is extremely low in most people. Thus, meditation of mantras \neven in counts of millions does not make much difference really. There is an \nimpact only if one spends 4-5 hours meditating on the mantra everyday. The \nfirst hour or so is warm up, mind slowly achieves a decent focus after that \nand the fire starts to burn slowly.\n\nIf you do the same meditation in front of an external fire, it makes a big \ndifference. You tend to absorb some qualities from the people you spend time \nwith. When you spend a lot of time with a cinema fan, the cinema fan inside \nyou becomes strong. When you spend a lot of time with a politics observer, \nthe politics observer inside you becomes strong. Similarly, when you spend a \nlot of time with fire, the fire inside you becomes strong.\n\nIf you do a 30-min homam and spend just 10 minutes meditating by the fire \nafter homam, the energy surrounding you, the level of focus you can get and \nthe amount of impurities you can burn are much more than a regular \nmeditation for a couple of hours!\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne need not believe me. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. If \nanybody tries to do a 30-minute homam everyday (or atleast every weekend) \nfor a few months, one should find some difference internally.\n\nMahaganapathi homam is very apt for many people. Lord Ganapathi takes care \nof one&#39;s material needs and gives spiritual progress at the same time. A \ndetailed manual, an audio MP3 file and a complete youtube video of a simple \n20-min Mahaganapathi homam are available for free, so that people can learn \nand get started (see the link below).\n\n*        *        *\n\nIt is not without a reason that many sadhus (saints) maintain a dhuni \n(constant fire) near them. When at Dakshineshwar, Swami Vivekananda used to \nlight a big fire in open space that would burn throughout the night and he \nused to meditate by it whole night.\n\nIf one can actually spend a couple of hours meditating by the side of a \nbright fire everyday, I am sure they can make a lot of quick progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, February 19, 2009 11:52 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa & Meditation !!!\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Garu!\n&gt;\n&gt; I read somewhere that you are of the opinion that 20/30 minutes Homa\n&gt; is equivalent to 4/5 hours of Meditation. I didn&#39;t understand it.\n&gt; some 3 or 4 days back, i suddenly realise, while in the midst of\n&gt; homa activities that i&#39;ve always forgotten about the surroundings\n&gt; whenever i sit for homa. (from preparation to conclusion). this i\n&gt; realised suddenly. for example - After taking bath, i empty all\n&gt; ashes of previous day in a bag, wash & clean homa-kund with liquid\n&gt; detergent, wash other utensils, and other such required preparation,\n&gt; start the actual procedure and conclude. during all theses\n&gt; activities, the surroundings are almost forgotten (i also make sure\n&gt; that i switch on the silent mode in cell phone).\n&gt;\n&gt; no w i am getting some glimpses of what you meant but still wish to\n&gt; understand more on that from you. take your time as i know that you\n&gt; have your hands-full.\n&gt;\n&gt; warm regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n\n\n\n"}}
