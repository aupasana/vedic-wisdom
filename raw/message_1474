He did have a initiati=\r\non to awaken his kundalini.\n\nAwakening of Kundalini and following further i=\r\ns also a path like many other paths to self realization.\n\nIn short Kundalin=\r\ni Shakti is the same energy or life force which is present in all of us. Wh=\r\nen it is not awakened the flow is outward, we are in the building and expan=\r\nding mode of karma i.e. accumulating more sanskars, when the Kundalini Shak=\r\nti is awakened, this flow of the energy is directed inwards towards cleansi=\r\nng our chitta and it starts eliminating the impressions or our sanskars, i.=\r\ne. contraction.\n\nOthers paths also do similar things in that they also star=\r\nt contraction or cleansing.\n \nKundalini Shakti can also arise automatically=\r\n by the sadhak&#39;s severe penance or if in the past lives it has happened bef=\r\nore than as soon has the correct time comes i.e. stars line up, that sadhak=\r\n shall see the  KS rising and taking him further.\n\nAwakening of Kundalini S=\r\nhakti does not mean self realization, there is still ways to go like in any=\r\n other path.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n=A0\n\n\n"}}
