Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any oppor=\r\ntunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be re=\r\ncalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved=\r\n and new set is generated based on need.\n\nThe Buddhists do not believe in t=\r\nhe existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our id=\r\nea of Atmah. Therefore their idea of reincarnation is very different. It is=\r\n like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together to giv=\r\ne the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrated=\r\n and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can c=\r\noalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can si=\r\nmultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. =C2=\r\n=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to=\r\n have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another =\r\npart of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a L=\r\nama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his ener=\r\ngy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating=\r\n in another person and all these\n happening simultaneously! It fits with th=\r\neir philosophy.\n\nThose philosophies which believed in this kind of a reinca=\r\nrnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed o=\r\nnly by a supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scrip=\r\ntures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid o=\r\nf the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. T=\r\nhere is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency to=\r\nwards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n\nBut the ol=\r\nd Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at =\r\ndeath unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another a=\r\nnd the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul&#39;s i=\r\nnfluence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle=\r\n for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul =\r\n- for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *co=\r\nnsciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=\r\n=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only one a=\r\nmong many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state \nof complete ne=\r\ngation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there was j=\r\nust no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. The l=\r\naw of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give a=\r\nnd take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important =\r\nthing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to =\r\nthe surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. =\r\nNature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is wh=\r\ny a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can transfo=\r\nrm himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hu=\r\nndred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whereas tho=\r\nse aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are fir=\r\nmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of en=\r\nergy. \n\nNow since the soul is what remembers and everything else being peri=\r\nshable, the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it=\r\n is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cine=\r\nmatic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been l=\r\nives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those=\r\n are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature, tho=\r\nse lives serve no purpose at all. \n\n\nMoreover all these are possible ONLY i=\r\nf and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a very ve=\r\nry strong manner. That is not easy. \n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI ha=\r\nve a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be=\r\n sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them a=\r\nll.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n \n=C2=A0 \nNamaste,\n=C2=A0\nI know those who a=\r\nre excited by these new age ideas like &quot;past life regression&quot; will be badly=\r\n upset with honest views, but let me state my view.\n\n=C2=A0\nIt is possible =\r\nto remember past life. \nHowever, if such memory does not come at a very you=\r\nng age due to some deep \ndesires from past life or an unnatural death befor=\r\ne, it is not easy to get it later.

Th=\r\nis form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik =\r\nscriptures He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chand=\r\nika. References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some=\r\n versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for cent=\r\nuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spir=\r\nits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The standar=\r\nd mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitt=\r\ning. And this should be continued daily till such time that there is some v=\r\nisible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instanc=\r\ne of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible=\r\n to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no o=\r\nne has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a dis=\r\ntance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the one tryin=\r\ng to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will have t=\r\no do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha,=\r\n you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being i=\r\nn a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits In=\r\ndia, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi=\r\n and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once ins=\r\nide the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these t=\r\nwo temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adept=\r\ns in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee=\r\n for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some spe=\r\ncific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform t=\r\nheir rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am=\r\n sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in,=\r\n O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like=\r\n a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;__________________=\r\n______________\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: =\r\nRe: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are various cla=\r\nsses and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and so=\r\nme of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many diffe=\r\nrent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but=\r\n whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depen=\r\nds on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It =\r\nall depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual=\r\n and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out =\r\nthe root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the p=\r\nerson. Sometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting somewhere (whe=\r\nre this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and be=\r\ning susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body=\r\n, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm =\r\nto an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot on=\r\ne stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on =\r\nthe shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to hel=\r\np are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spiri=\r\nt of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tryi=\r\nng to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not f=\r\nall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is ge=\r\ntting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay =\r\naway. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n hand=\r\nle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time til=\r\nl which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of th=\r\ne individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve so=\r\nme not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spir=\r\nit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individua=\r\nl I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting =\r\nany exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well a=\r\ns the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the p=\r\nrevious karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit an=\r\nd do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free w=\r\nill, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove =\r\nit by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a =\r\nvery violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do is a=\r\n) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and ho=\r\npe for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family memb=\r\ners to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi=\r\n, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it =\r\nwith samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20=\r\n mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of posses=\r\nsion. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the m=\r\nental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. =\r\nWhile doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then eith=\r\ner make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her.=\r\n And pray as hard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck and may God help the fa=\r\nmily.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethe=\r\nreal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter thro=\r\nugh them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013=\r\n 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spir=\r\nits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will conv=\r\ney this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strang=\r\ne noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive =\r\nto different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something =\r\ndivine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel=\r\n good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I=\r\n would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see=\r\n them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would=\r\n wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely=\r\n hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to se=\r\ne nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I in=\r\nstantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be t=\r\nhat spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more p=\r\neople staying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, s=\r\no it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at =\r\nthat place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to =\r\nsleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I starte=\r\nd waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short bein=\r\ngs (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun=\r\n rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astr=\r\nal beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep.

Rein=\r\ncarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments f=\r\nrom past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousne=\r\nss. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportuni=\r\nty for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recall=\r\ned. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and=\r\n new set is generated based on need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in=\r\n the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our =\r\nidea of Atmah. Therefore their idea of reincarnation is very different. It =\r\nis like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to =\r\ngive the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegra=\r\nted and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these ca=\r\nn coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can=\r\n simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &=\r\nnbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, =\r\nto have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anothe=\r\nr part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a=\r\n Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his en=\r\nergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnati=\r\nng in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with t=\r\nheir philosophy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a=\r\n reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy gov=\r\nerned only by a supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Ja=\r\nin scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to g=\r\net rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Ni=\r\nrvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the ten=\r\ndency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not=\r\n dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one lif=\r\ne to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop=\r\n this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human min=\r\nd/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual an=\r\nd unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, =\r\nbe able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a=\r\n Divine Life.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot t=\r\nhe ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; mo=\r\nving into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and=\r\n inevitable aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and p=\r\nerform complex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, but it i=\r\ns not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case =\r\nof the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is hel=\r\nping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it =\r\nchanges the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unf=\r\nailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must =\r\nhave killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [=\r\n he did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the =\r\nhands of those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \n=\r\nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe=\r\n law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: times new r=\r\noman,new york,times,serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: norma=\r\nl;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16=\r\npx; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; background-color: tr=\r\nansparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers =\r\nand everything else being perishable, the only indestructible link between =\r\npast life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recal=\r\nled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasi=\r\nzing. Now if there have been lives when the soul had little or no frontal r=\r\nole to play at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet under =\r\nwith no trace. For Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family:\n tim=\r\nes new roman,new york,times,serif; background-color: transparent; font-styl=\r\ne: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-=\r\nsize: 16px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; background-c=\r\nolor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover all these are possib=\r\nle ONLY if and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in =\r\na very very strong manner.
