But the world of duality is a lot more tricky.\n \nPlease see t=\r\nhe &quot;many faced diamond&quot; analogy for god at the end of http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1 to get clarity on why different people give=\r\n different hierarchies and consider different beings as supreme. As per Nar=\r\nayana sooktam, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came f=\r\nrom Narayana. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including Brahma=\r\n, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi. As per Ganapathi Atharva s=\r\neersham, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ga=\r\nnapathi. As per Suryopanishat, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, I=\r\nndra etc) came from Surya. And so on.\n \nThe duality is so vast and yet non-=\r\nduality is the underlying supreme reality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy w=\r\nithin hierarchy will have to start at the connection with non-duality and i=\r\nt is not one. In other words, any hierarchy given by anyone is with respect=\r\n to one perspective. I will not be too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, be=\r\ncause that cannot be done really. If you haven&#39;t before, do read the analog=\r\ny in the last part of the mail mentioned above. It is an analogy worth gett=\r\ning into your thinking system.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; I mean is it the R=\r\nishi who is acting our the Mother&#39;s instructions\n&gt; or is it She who is crea=\r\nting the environment for the Rishi&#39;s wish\n&gt; to come true? Which one came fi=\r\nrst?\n \nThere is no causal relationship between the two. Actions of rishis a=\r\nnd the will of the supreme cosmic being are in sync. They just happen toget=\r\nher. Neither causes the other.\n \nRishis are the most perfected beings witho=\r\nut a trace of ego and yet performing actions of great consequence, with zer=\r\no attachment. They operate right on the border of duality and non-duality.\n=\r\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; As a devotee it is natural and simple to believe =\r\nthat the God I\n&gt; pray to is the Ultimate Supreme authority, but when I hear=\r\n that\n&gt; Rishis are even beyond this, then doubt creeps in, is the deity\n&gt; t=\r\nherefore not as supreme as is made out to be?\n \nOur ego does not leave us e=\r\nven in sadhana. Sometimes, one&#39;s belief that one&#39;s guru is the best guru or=\r\n the god one prays to is the supreme one is rooted in one&#39;e ego and one&#39;s n=\r\need to be the best and be associated with the best. Just contemplate if tha=\r\nt is the case and if it is, try to root out such thinking.\n \nHaving said th=\r\nat, do look at the god you pray to as the supreme and try to reach the supr=\r\neme through him/her by surrendering to him/her. If you take a low level man=\r\nifestation of that deity, then rishis may indeed be beyond him/her as Vimal=\r\nananda said. But, if you take the highest manifestation of the deity, as th=\r\ne supreme cosmic being, then rishis are his playmates and neither above nor=\r\n below.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you take a company, there may be a chair=\r\nman who may be the highest authority. But, it may be a ceremonial role and =\r\nsome may consider CEO to be higher while some may consider the chairman to =\r\nbe higher. Why bother about who is higher? In a company does well, they bot=\r\nh work with understanding.\n \nThe hierarchy is irrelevant to one who is a cl=\r\nerk at the company. Just follow the order of your boss (guru) instead of wo=\r\nndering whether chairman calls the shots or CEO.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 23, 2009 6:56 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n\n        Namaste Narasmihaji=\r\n\n\n        I have a question.

Also, he need not be talking about somebody &quot;conne=\r\ncted to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are c=\r\nonnections between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of S=\r\nister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her wel=\r\nl when he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aur=\r\nobindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and le=\r\narnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel =\r\nof Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expa=\r\nnd his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And=\r\n so on.\n\n          Coming back to the main point, the supermind established=\r\n in the field of earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a ma=\r\nharshi paying some attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in th=\r\ne divine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge c=\r\nhanges on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play=\r\n to make some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the pl=\r\nay, he may focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and =\r\ndirect a few important souls to do some key work. Some important souls (dei=\r\nties, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be bo=\r\nrn on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.\n\n          You may =\r\nthen see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and rea=\r\nlized beings born on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritu=\r\nal knowledge. Each of them will get specific internal/external guidance fro=\r\nm the divine, based on what their part in the play is.\n\n          *        =\r\n*        *\n\n          The &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is=\r\n all around us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego in pretty =\r\nmuch everybody. At the grossest level, he manifests as blatant lies, wrong =\r\npropaganda etc.\n\n          One should not tolerate this Asura (demon) and f=\r\night hard. However, one should not hate this Asura or those afflicted by hi=\r\nm. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand for truth but not hate=\r\n the liar at the same time. There is nothing that needs to be hated in this=\r\n world. One should learn to do the job assigned to one by Nature without at=\r\ntraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and with unconditional love (i=\r\n.e. no expectations of a return) to all.\n\n          &gt; This was a very inter=\r\nesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n          &gt; says about changes com=\r\ning in the world.\n\n          I know very little. But I was told that an age=\r\n that is somewhat like the bygone ages will be established on earth for a f=\r\new hundred years in the coming decades. The reason the Divine Mother appear=\r\ned before Manish and asked him to spread simple homam procedures in the wor=\r\nld was to prepare the grounds for that. Manish also told me that all this i=\r\ns the play of a senior maharshi.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasim=\r\nha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n ---------\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org/ tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=\r\nic- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.co=\r\nmcast. net\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nn nath.org\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- \n\n            ----- Original Message ----- \n            =\r\nFrom: Laxmi Narayan \n            To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n      =\r\n      Sent: Sunday, June 21, 2009 6:50 PM\n            Subject: Re: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n                  Hi, Some=\r\n time back I saw  similar article and was intrigued by it.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n\n      =\r\n                    Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian=\r\n freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth whi=\r\nch had not been expressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw=\r\n that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw=\r\n that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for =\r\nthis divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descendin=\r\ng to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resi=\r\nstance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=\r\n=BD\n                          =EF=BF=BD\n                          Sri Aurob=\r\nindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, w=\r\nho later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of=\r\n intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal un=\r\ncertainties we face today.\n                          =EF=BF=BD\n            =\r\n              Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter,=\r\n and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of=\r\n the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The pr=\r\nocess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evol=\r\nution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these=\r\n two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he fore=\r\nsaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=\r\n=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely chan=\r\nge everything on Earth.\n                          =EF=BF=BD\n               =\r\n           Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo=\r\n, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, =\r\neven if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows h=\r\nim, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed pers=\r\nonality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of th=\r\ne outer senses seems to contradict it.\n\n                          Sri Aurob=\r\nindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A s=\r\ntage has been reached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides o=\r\nn the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinc=\r\ntion as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1=\r\n973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what may be terme=\r\nd the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, =\r\nand is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular conscio=\r\nusness.\n\n                          Evolution took a great leap forward with=\r\n the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at t=\r\nhe threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare fo=\r\nr the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of=\r\n human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently=\r\n upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current speci=\r\nes, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstruc=\r\nted from contacting and merging with it.\n                          =EF=BF=\r\n=BD\n                          Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a =\r\nspecies that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an e=\r\nver-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and =\r\nlive from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n\n            =\r\n              Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inha=\r\nbit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, =\r\nwhich is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular co=\r\nnsciousness. \n\n                          Finally, our ultimate goal as a sp=\r\necies is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully=\r\n within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could c=\r\nall =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matt=\r\ner and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n\n                        =\r\n  The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramenta=\r\nl consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. S=\r\nince this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consc=\r\niousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of =\r\nthe Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifesta=\r\ntion in collective matter.\n                          Whenever there is a =\r\n=EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo =\r\nand the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is=\r\n the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and=\r\n the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, a=\r\nnd which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them =\r\nthe Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently=\r\n, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter=\r\n two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the=\r\n Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during Worl=\r\nd War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence=\r\n. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing o=\r\nther world leaders in the current political sphere.\n\n                      =\r\n    With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsole=\r\nte human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized t=\r\nhat although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily cat=\r\nastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world=\r\n for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintain=\r\ned, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance b=\r\ny means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventual=\r\nly be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and T=\r\nruth.

In his high states of divine union he saw that \n                        =\r\n  the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of \n                  =\r\n        mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right \n            =\r\n              here on Earth and that the time for this divine \n            =\r\n              emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven \n      =\r\n                    descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a \n     =\r\n                     breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within =\r\n\n                          her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=\r\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri \n                          Aurobindo was join=\r\ned in Pondicherry, India, by a \n                          French mystic, Mi=\r\nrra Alfassa, who later became known \n                          as the Mothe=\r\nr. Together they embarked on a journey of \n                          intens=\r\nive cellular transformation that is very \n                          relevan=\r\nt to the colossal uncertainties we face \n                          today.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force \n                   =\r\n       permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore \n               =\r\n           has a force of consciousness. The process of the \n              =\r\n            divine spirit descending down into matter is called \n          =\r\n                involution. The process by which the divine ascends \n      =\r\n                    back upwards out of matter is called evolution. \n      =\r\n                    According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a \n   =\r\n                       stage where these two events are occurring \n        =\r\n                  simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw \n   =\r\n                       that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what=\r\n \n                          he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) con=\r\nsciousness=EF=BF=BD \n                          that would entirely change e=\r\nverything on \n                          Earth.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Man=EF=BF=BD=\r\ns greatness is not in what he is, \n                          says Sri Aurob=\r\nindo, but in what he makes possible. An \n                          immortal=\r\n soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom \n                          ac=\r\ntive in most people, while an eternal spirit \n                          ove=\r\nrshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by \n                         =\r\n the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is \n                   =\r\n       a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of \n            =\r\n              the outer senses seems to contradict it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              =\r\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \n   =\r\n                       size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo recognized that \n =\r\n                         humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis.=\r\n A \n                          stage has been reached in which the human min=\r\nd has \n                          made tremendous strides on the one hand, b=\r\nut is left \n                          hopelessly inadequate to prevent its =\r\nown extinction as \n                          a species. Meanwhile, as the M=\r\nother testified before \n                          her death in 1973, a cons=\r\nciousness higher than the \n                          human rational mind, w=\r\nhat may be termed the Supermind, \n                          has recently be=\r\nen established in the fields of the \n                          Earth, and i=\r\ns active there. Our task now is to bring \n                          it down=\r\n into cellular consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;Evol=\r\nution took a great leap forward with the \n                          origins=\r\n of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. \n                          =\r\nWe are now at the threshold of another leap forward, \n                     =\r\n     even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence \n                =\r\n          of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four \n              =\r\n            stages of human evolution, which we will soon be \n             =\r\n             starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The \n         =\r\n                 first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current speci=\r\nes, a \n                          rational being possessing an individualize=\r\nd soul, but \n                          largely obstructed from contacting a=\r\nnd merging with \n                          it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that \n                          is=\r\n spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence \n                     =\r\n     of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that \n                =\r\n          is largely able to merge and live from \n                         =\r\n soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n                      =\r\n    &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverm=\r\nan,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit \n                          a dense phys=\r\nical body, but will be in possession of \n                          the Mind=\r\n of Light, which is supramental consciousness \n                          th=\r\nat has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n                       =\r\n   &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;Finally, our ultimate goal as =\r\na species is the \n                          =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within \n                          the subt=\r\nle realms of matter. This will be a race of \n                          what=\r\n we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this \n              =\r\n            species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully \n       =\r\n                   realized upon Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                         =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother \n                     =\r\n     was in bringing supramental consciousness down into \n                 =\r\n         the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since \n           =\r\n               this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the \n      =\r\n                    supramental consciousness was simultaneously being \n   =\r\n                       brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, =\r\n\n                          awaiting the moment when it would flower into it=\r\ns full \n                          manifestation in collective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Wh=\r\nenever there \n                          is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD ther=\r\ne is corresponding resistance. Sri \n                          Aurobindo and=\r\n the Mother speak of their experience \n                          with the f=\r\nour =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine \n                    =\r\n      forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura \n             =\r\n             of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of \n           =\r\n               Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the \n          =\r\n                forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem \n    =\r\n                      to be in control of current global events. According =\r\n\n                          to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gon=\r\ne \n                          through a transformation recently, and the Asu=\r\nra of \n                          Suffering has returned to Source, and so o=\r\nnly the \n                          latter two still remain to wreak havoc o=\r\nn Earth. \n                          Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura =\r\nof Falsehood \n                          =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD throug=\r\nh Hitler during World War II, and \n                          of their own i=\r\nntensive inner work in countering his \n                          influence.=\r\n It would not be difficult to see how this \n                          same =\r\nAsura may be influencing other world leaders in \n                          =\r\nthe current political sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;With=\r\n the descent of this new vibratory \n                          consciousness=\r\n all our old obsolete human structures \n                          will be d=\r\nemolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized \n                          tha=\r\nt although the changes will be enormous they would \n                       =\r\n   not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth \n                   =\r\n       automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the \n             =\r\n             most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, \n      =\r\n                    he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which \n=\r\n                          could overcome this resistance by means other tha=\r\nn \n                          dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras wil=\r\nl \n                          eventually be absorbed into their original ema=\r\nnations \n                          of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It ma=\r\ny be \n                          interesting to speculate, with all the viol=\r\nence in the \n                          world today, the destruction we migh=\r\nt have experienced \n                          if not for this power of harm=\r\nonization!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;When does all this h=\r\nappen? Sri Aurobindo and \n                          the Mother believed tha=\r\nt the world stage was set for \n                          this quantum desce=\r\nnt, and that it was quite imminent. \n                          The Mother s=\r\naid in 1968 that the supramental \n                          transformation =\r\nwas a certainty now, and that it would \n                          come abou=\r\nt with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough \n                       =\r\n   this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the \n        =\r\n                  year 2000 would be a turning point.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n           =\r\n               &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;This=\r\n was a very interesting read and matches what \n                          Na=\r\nrasimhaji says about changes coming in the \n                          world=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                 =\r\n         &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;=\r\nSTRONG&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN \n   =\r\n                       style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: =\r\nVerdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n                          face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 si=\r\nze=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT \n                          color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of con=\r\nsciousness) is \n                          Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva \n =\r\n                         Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/T=\r\nD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE=\r\n&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_020E_01C9F45C.4C2F0BD0--\r\n\n"}}
