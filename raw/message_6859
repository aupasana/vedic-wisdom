I see no inconsistency between the two statements=\r\n you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked me to reconcile:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) Nobody can escape the res=\r\nult of one&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Remedies such as homam and japam can prevent=\r\n the ill-effects of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What we have to realize is tha=\r\nt karma (action) is something that keeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flowing continuously and dyn=\r\namically. It is not something frozen in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time. Yes, karmas done in pre=\r\nvious lives, *before* current birth, are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frozen in the form of one&#39;s =\r\nhoroscope. BUT, one does not stop doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas after birth. One keeps=\r\n doing karmas and they get added to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karma pipeline.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nne has to experience the results of one&#39;s karmas, but different\n&gt; &gt; karmas\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may give results after different waiting times. Some karmas take a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to give results and some fructify fast. When big karmas o=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; commits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after birth are added to this karma pipeline, it may b=\r\ne re-arranged.\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; newer karmas done in this life may give result=\r\ns ahead of older karmas\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some older karmas may be pushed back.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you sow some kind of seeds in a field, it may take a long =\r\ntime\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them to become trees and give fruits (sweet or sour or b=\r\nitter). When\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sow some other kind of seeds, it may take a shor=\r\nt time for them to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; become trees and give fruits (sweet or sour or bit=\r\nter). Like that,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different karmas (seeds) need different time to give=\r\n fruits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If your field is filled with bad trees or plants or se=\r\neds, it does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prevent you from sowing new seeds that give desirabl=\r\ne fruits. A new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; plant may give good fruits or atleast stop an older b=\r\nad plant from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; growing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one blocked an older bad karma =\r\nfrom giving its result using a\n&gt; &gt; remedy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as homam or japam, tha=\r\nt act of homam or japam is also a karma\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pushed out or blocke=\r\nd the older karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is one more thing re=\r\nally. Apart from sowing new seeds or\n&gt; &gt; blocking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; old seeds/plants fr=\r\nom growing, remedies can also make one spiritually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mature and even li=\r\nberate one. With spiritual maturity, one can handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the stress of bad=\r\n times better. When I have a problem, I can get\n&gt; &gt; worried\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the p=\r\nroblem can be blown up, become weightier in my mind and cause\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more st=\r\nress. Or I can say, &quot;well, this too will pass&quot; and move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though th=\r\ne basic problem itself cannot be avoided, I can stop it from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming=\r\n weightier in my mind and causing more stress. Most of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems c=\r\nause far more stress than they should, because we waste so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much time =\r\nand mental energy worrying about and worrying about what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in ou=\r\nr hands, instead of accepting what is not in our hands and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focusing a=\r\nttention on what is in our hands and doing the best we can.\n&gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cle=\r\nar mind enabled by spiritual sadhana can minimize such dispersion\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; energy and wasting of time. That way too, spiritual sadhana helps.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally know several people who do homam everyday now and lead=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happier lives, though the ground situation may have been th=\r\ne same!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japam and homam can also be used as &quot;placebos&quot; like you=\r\n said. But they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have the potential to be far more than that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Ju=\r\nl 9, 2011 at 2:35 AM, Yogesh Lajmi wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Mr.Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly reconcile the following\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions of our Great Anci=\r\nent Rishis...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.

Kavachas of various deities (or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planets) are prote=\r\nctive sheaths covering one&#39;s consciousness and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stopping harmful influ=\r\nences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get hold of)=\r\n give good and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad results by grasping one&#39;s consciousness and affect=\r\ning it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Each planet has positives and negatives, in general and=\r\n also based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the chart. If one chants the kavacha of a planet many =\r\ntimes,\n&gt; &gt; eventually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a protective sheath is formed around one&#39;s cons=\r\nciousness with the\n&gt; &gt; nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and energy of that planet. This will ob=\r\nviously offer protection that\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consistent with the nature of th=\r\nat planet, in general and in one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chart. But, please remember that r=\r\neading the kavacha of any planet\n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT harm you. Even the kava=\r\ncha of 8th lord or 6th lord will not harm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose on=\r\ne has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will\n&gt; &gt; protect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on=\r\ne from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), untimely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\neath (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital area\n&gt; &gt; (8th)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. There may be other things based on other factors like aspects,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may also protect in=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the matters of love, romance, creativity etc also. Bottomline is tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the planet is conducive to wi=\r\nll\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protected by the planet&#39;s energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you pick a=\r\n wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, but no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; harm is don=\r\ne. Even bad planets in your chart will have some aspects\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wan=\r\nt to protect and doing their kavacha will protect those aspects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; chant the kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\navachas I have seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SrimadBhagavata=\r\nm)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Chandi Kavacha are the most potent kavachas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But p=\r\nlease note that chanting a kavacha once or twice or even once or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; twic=\r\ne a day is hardly sufficient. If one has enough purity already,\n&gt; &gt; most\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; mantras work right away. But most of us have very dense conditioning\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the energy of mantras gets dispersed. The energy of the planet/=\r\ndeity\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the kavacha we chant cannot form a sheath around us easi=\r\nly. It\n&gt; &gt; requires\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intense sadhana for most people. If one chants a =\r\nkavacha 10-30 times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then some ki=\r\nnd of results can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is nee=\r\nded for most people to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see some results. Getting things done by a pro=\r\nfessional priest is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not that useful, as there are very very few =\r\npriests with the required\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purity, the ability to identify with your p=\r\nroblem and the ability to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transfer the energy. For most people, the b=\r\nest solution is to learn\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chant by themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;h=\r\nttp://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyo=\r\ntish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Th=\r\nu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 AM, monkeymonkeyking10 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste a=\r\nll,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I sincerely hope our moderator forgives this question which=\r\n I also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; posted on the jyotish forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavach=\r\na for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, if a planet such as Rahu =\r\nis giving one to have problems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during his dasha, would one recite the=\r\n Kavach of Rahu, OR some other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;counter-balancing&quot; planet that was st=\r\nrong in one&#39;s chart?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
