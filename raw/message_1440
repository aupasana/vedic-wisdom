They are tw=\r\no distinctly different items.\nAny path practised sincerely under the guidan=\r\nce of a siddha gurudev\nleads to end place, and once reaching there everythi=\r\nng is alike.\n\nWhat path one gets attracted to and make progress depends on =\r\nthe constituent sanskars that person has, accumulated over many past lives.=\r\n\n\nAll paths are equal having their own pros and cons. \nKriya Yoga is very e=\r\nffective in doing Nadi Shudi, the first step, along with this one needs to =\r\npractise Vaivhar Shuddi - good conduct.\n\nI am not sure about Sri Sri&#39;s suda=\r\nrshan kriya, but babaji&#39;s kriya yoga had 10 or so different kriya, which we=\r\nre taught to the sadhak one after other as he made progress, these kriyas c=\r\nan be also termed as pranayams or yogic breathing technics.\n\nBut as one pro=\r\ngress eventually the Kundalini Shakti rises and it takes over and that is w=\r\nhat is called the Raja Yoga in Bhagvat Geeta.\n\nOnce Kundalini Shakti starts=\r\n rising and does chakra bhadan, the sadhaka starts to do interesting medita=\r\ntion, yoga, mantra in spontanous way, i.e he is not the doer, he is just th=\r\ne observer to the play of shakti.\n\nThis leads to experiances that are not v=\r\nery easy to explain or describe.\n\nSimilarly doing Homam also, the path is s=\r\nlightly different as with control and concentration on fire, one regulates =\r\ninternal fire and that is also the way.\n\nThe main benefit of fire is the im=\r\npact on environment, it cleans up the environment. Also their a sloka, from=\r\n fire, we have smoke and it creates clouds and clouds create rain and rain =\r\ncreats food, it supports the natural cycle.\n\nThese days we see a lot of peo=\r\nple proposing Homams is due to the fact that we have severly polluted our e=\r\nnvironment, global warming, water pollution etc. Homams help in cleaning up=\r\n the environment.\n\nWhy worry about air and fire, practice what suits your m=\r\nind or practise both. do kriya yoga in morning and homan in evening.\n\nIn my=\r\n opionion an integrated systematic approach of\nvyavhaar suddi, nadi suddhi,=\r\n service or seva, mantra yoga, other forms of yoga, bhajans and satsang is =\r\nneeded in these trying times to\nget focused. One needs to constantly focus =\r\non his chitta and look at the impurties and try to clean them using one or =\r\nmore of above techniques.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Garu!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOne questioning thought which is stuck in my mind which i wish to put it in=\r\n front of you & list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agni is purer then Vayu - this comparision state=\r\nment is not very difficult to accept.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT i am thinking about Yogis, w=\r\nho reached the truth by first holding on to the silk thread (breath) which =\r\nis the only available external link which connects external and internal wo=\r\nrld contineously.\n&gt; \n&gt; for example take a couple of cases such as Babaji an=\r\nd his leanage. Sri Sri Ravishankar, Rishi Prabhakar and many such known and=\r\n unknown.\n&gt; these people (especially the first to names) advocated &#39;Kriya Y=\r\noga&#39; in a very big way. Paramhamsa Yogananada in his celebrated work &#39;The a=\r\nutobiography of a yogi&#39; categorically mention that Kriya Yoga is like a Jet=\r\n Flight to reach the truth in comparision to the other methods which are li=\r\nke bullock cart. he also mentions that Kriya yoga was first taught by Krish=\r\nna to Arjuna and then it was lost in time and was again revived by Mahaavat=\r\nar Bababji and passed on to Lahir Mahashaya and the others.\n&gt; It is claimed=\r\n that Sri sri Ravishankar went in to deep silence for some 8 days in the ye=\r\nar 1980 and he came out with &#39;Sudarshan Kriya Yoga&#39; for the world. he start=\r\ned teaching that and now it is practised regularly by millions of people.\n&gt;=\r\n I know from my abstract experiences that Kriya yoga of Babaji and Sudarsha=\r\nn kriya yoga by Sri Sri are essentially same. why i say that because one da=\r\ny i yearningly prayed babaji for helping me to learn Kriya yoga and within =\r\na month i learnt Sudarshan kriya by AOL accidently.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; The point is th=\r\nat these people are advocating some or the other form of Kriya yoga, Raja Y=\r\noga, Hathyoga etc.. for all of these initial base is external medium which =\r\nis Air (Vayu). I myself have done Sudarshan Kriya for some 2 years.\n&gt; ***\n&gt;=\r\n Babaji or Sri Sri or any other master (present day or ancient) have stress=\r\ned on this medium. they actually didn&#39;t advocate Agni for the masses (Thoug=\r\nh as i said in prevous message that some have started advocating Homa of la=\r\nte). it is obvious that they may not be oblivious of the fact that Agni is =\r\nmore purer medium then air.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; I Wish to have your views on this wh=\r\nole subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; yours spiritually,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
