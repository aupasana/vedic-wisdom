He was then living in Skandashram, which looks like the\nvery h=\r\neart of the majestic hill, Arunachalam. It is a beautiful, quiet spot\nwith =\r\na cluster of coconut and other trees and a perennial crystal-clear\nspring.\n=\r\n\nGanapati Muni\n\nWhen I entered Maharshi&#39;s hut early the next morning and bo=\r\nwed to him, there\nwere many devotees seated before him. But my attention wa=\r\ns particularly\ngripped by a radiant personality amidst that group. He was, =\r\nI learned,\nKavyakanta Ganapati Sastri. He had the face-cut of the great poe=\r\nt\nRabindranath Tagore and from the light that shone on his face, I found ho=\r\nw\nmistaken I had been in my hitherto impression that he was only one of the=\r\n\nlearned pandits. His broad forehead, gracefully bright eyes, aquiline nose=\r\n,\ncharming face and beard, and the melodious ring in his voice =E2=80=94 al=\r\nl these\nproclaimed that he was a genius, a great poet, a rishi. Everything =\r\nabout him\nreminded me of the Vedic seers, especially Vasistha, and it is in=\r\nteresting\nto note that he was of the line of Vasishta. There was authority,=\r\n dignity\nand sweetness in his talks and his eyes sparkled as he spoke.\n\nHe =\r\nwas then living in the Mango Tree Cave on the eastern slope of\nArunachala. =\r\nAdjoining it and a little above it is the perennial\nspring,Tiru-Mullaipal-T=\r\nhertham. This cave has often served as the Maharshi&#39;s\nsummer abode when he =\r\nlived at Virupaksha Cave. It was here, in the Mango\nTree Cave, that Ganapat=\r\ni Muni composed extempore the last quarter of a\n&#39;Thousand Verses in Praise =\r\nof Uma&#39; (Uma Sahasram) within a few hours one\nnight, in the presence of the=\r\n Maharshi.\n\nOne evening I went to that cave to see him. I waited for him a =\r\nfew minutes\nin the room next to the cave before Ganapati Muni emerged from =\r\nthe cave.\nThere was the fragrance of tapas in the person of the Muni and ab=\r\nout his\nresidence. I sat down before him after paying my respects to him. H=\r\ne\nsilently looked at me for a few minutes. Then I had a talk with him about=\r\n\nspiritual sadhana and the details of discipline needed for it. After a few=\r\n\ndays I expressed to the Maharshi my desire to go through the principal\nUpa=\r\nnishads. Maharshi directed me to go to &#39;Nayana&#39;,saying that he was the\nman =\r\nwho could elucidate anything concerning sacred lore. So I went to Nayana\nan=\r\nd placed before him a passage from the Taitiriya Upanishad for\nexplanation.=\r\n\n\nHe dilated upon its profound significance with clarity and ease. After\nhe=\r\naring him for an hour, I came to the conclusion that I need not make a\nstud=\r\ny of the Upanishads under him, as whatever he uttered was\nUpanishadic. Thou=\r\ngh\nNayana was himself a man of wisdom and tapas, he used to direct aspirant=\r\ns\ncoming to him to the Maharshi. He knew that there was a special effect in=\r\n\nhearing the truth of Atman from the Maharshi himself. And Maharshi would\ns=\r\nend to Nayana devotees who sought light upon upasana (methods of worship)\no=\r\nr details pertaining to various sastras. Thus their mutual appreciative\nrel=\r\nationship was beautiful.\n\nGuidance and Grace\n\nFour months after I came to A=\r\nrunachalam, my parents came there to have\ndarsan of Maharshi and take me ba=\r\nck home. Though they did not succeed in\ntheir latter intention, they were s=\r\nomehow consoled by the Maharshi before\nthey returned. My father is a cousin=\r\n of the Maharshi, older than him, and as\nsuch knew him very intimately as a=\r\n boy before he left home for\nTiruvannamalai. Though he had heard from other=\r\ns about the Maharshi and read\ncarefully Sri Ramana Gita, he came there with=\r\n an open mind to see for\nhimself what the Maharshi was. But the moment he s=\r\naw him he was so\noverpowered by a sense of veneration that he prostrated be=\r\nfore him with\nemotion and observed, &quot;There is nothing here of the Venkatara=\r\nman I knew,\nnothing to identify him.&quot;\n\nMaharshi gracefully smiled and remar=\r\nked, &quot;Oh! It is long since he\ndisappeared,&quot; indicating the complete transfo=\r\nrmation he had undergone. My\nfather then told the Maharshi that he had not =\r\ncome to him so long, as he had\nnot achieved dispassion for the world. &quot;How =\r\ncould a man,&quot; he said, &quot;who has\nno spirit of renunciation in him be benefit=\r\ned by the company of the sage?&quot;\nThe Maharshi, from his usual and normal hig=\r\nh level, replied, &quot;Oh! Then you\nseem to be obsessed by the delusion that yo=\r\nu are going to achieve vairagya\n(nonattachment) in some distant future. If =\r\nyou just discern your real\nnature, the Self, with what is it attached? Disp=\r\nassion is one&#39;s very\nnature.&quot;\n\nOne day someone told the Maharshi about a de=\r\nvotee who claimed to be Ramana\nhimself and said that honoring him was honor=\r\ning Ramana. Maharshi replied\nwith a smile, &quot;There is nothing wrong about it=\r\n; it is all right. But if\nsomebody else claims the same status for himself,=\r\n this man should not deny\nit, because every one is Ramana, all is Ramana.&quot; =\r\nWe all enjoyed that\nstraight and humorous remark of Maharshi.\n\nAs the recon=\r\nstruction of the Ashram cottage was then going on, Maharshi\noften remained =\r\nwith his devotees and visitors in the big stone mantap,\nsituated on the oth=\r\ner side of the road. Maharshi used to dine with all in\nthe shade of a huge =\r\nmango tree in front of his mother&#39;s samadhi. There was\ncool water kept in b=\r\nig pots at the foot of the tree during these hot summer\ndays. All of us enj=\r\noyed the cool shade, the cool water, and the grace of the\nMaharshi, which l=\r\nike a cool breeze removed the heat of man&#39;s torments.\n\nSource: http://www.a=\r\nrunachala.org/newsletters/2004/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636c924b216baf5048674775a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIT WAS in the beginning of January 1921 that I first saw Bhagava=\r\nn Sri Ramana Maharshi.
