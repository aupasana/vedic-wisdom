You can get=\r\n it here\n\nhttp://www.kannadaaudio.com/Songs/Devotional/home/MantraroopiMaha=\r\nVishnu-ChallakereBrothers.php\n\nAlso the idea of any Sahasra nama/ashtottara=\r\n shatanama is to ruminate over the qualities of Vishnu thus creating a flow=\r\ning meditation of attributes of that deity. For that to happen, one has to =\r\nbe able to recite from memory effortlessly. Needless to say this generally =\r\ntakes quite long time. But one has to start somewhere.
