Do 3 times like this and see the difference internally.\n\n(2) Yes, then continue counting afterwards.\n\n(3) In unavoidable situations, stick to as many rules as possible and break \nonly what is unavoidable.\n\n(4) If beard cannot be grown, hair can be grown. Do not cut the hair during \nthe time.\n\n(5) That is what he was saying. Even 10 malas a day take a long time.\n\nActually, if someone who has free time does the same procedure with \nsomething like 30 malas a day, really tremendous things are almost \nguaranteed to happen to that person within a year. But Manish&#39;s advice was \n10 malas a day.\n\n(6) Forget about all of that. Just think of Vishwamitra maharshi, Gayatri \ndevi, Savitri devi and Savitaa for a second and start with the mantra.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 03, 2009 4:52 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Fw: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re: Resolving \nPoints)\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt; There are people who know for sure,that *this* is the road-the right\n&gt; road-for them.They walk on that road, with full confidence and reach\n&gt; their destination sooner or later.\n&gt; But then there are others,who just keep standing and wondering which\n&gt; road to take.And then,someone comes from behind,holds your hand and\n&gt; says--come along,i&#39;ll lead the way--Seeing the confidence of that\n&gt; person all your confusion dissolves.\n&gt; This message from you and Manishji,is Godsend.I would like to follow\n&gt; what Manishji has suggested.\n&gt; There are however some small queries.Kindly resolve them-\n&gt;\n&gt; 1)100 days -3 times means---10 malas thrice a day right? ie.3240\n&gt; mantras a day.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2)In between there will be break for menses--is it 5/6 or 7 days\n&gt;\n&gt; 3)If one has to go out during this 100 days period,what then?The rules\n&gt; mentioned about same place,same materaials get broken.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4)The men are to grow beard.I am a lady,still i have some hair on my\n&gt; chin, for which i get threading done.Is this to be suspended too?But\n&gt; then it really looks weird.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5)My husband would also like to join in this anushthan,but his job\n&gt; will not allow him to do jaap thrice a day,so could he do 10 malas\n&gt; once a day?\n&gt;\n&gt; 6)What about dhyan viniyog nyas etc?I do not know much about these.Are\n&gt; these to be done before the jaap?\n&gt;    Also if you could please choose an auspicious day,for us to begin\n&gt; this anushthan,i&#39;ll be grateful.\n&gt; Thank you very much,\n&gt; Sunita.\n\n\n"}}
