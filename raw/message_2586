In the beginning, \ndo it ritualistically and get practice. After it becomes easier, now try to \nfocus more on the mantra and devata. Instead of focusing on how long it is \ntaking or how easy it is, forget about that part now and try to focus on the \ndeity and mantra.\n\nOne more thing.. Instead of doing a 3 hour homam, getting tired completely \nand not having the energy to meditate with concentration at the end, it is \nbetter to do a one hour homam and meditate with full concentration for 10-15 \nminutes at the end. Even if one does a long homam in the beginning and \ncompromises on the quality of meditation, one should eventually find a \nbalance between homam and meditation at the end. Do homam for as long as you \ncan and then meditate for 10-15 minutes with as perfect concentration as you \ncan while the poornaahuti burns. Try to forget everything and focus on the \nmantra. Meditation just after a homam is very effective and take advantage \nof the purity generated by the homam fire.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, September 20, 2009 4:32 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Time reduces as it passes !!!\n\n\nNamaste Anup ji,\n\nMy Daily Homam is still Ganapati Homam. I recite Chandi Paath daily. To \nclarify, i didn&#39;t move from Ganapti Homam to Chandi Homam (I think you wish \nto ask the same). However i perform chandi Homam occasionally.\n\nRegarding your query of switching from Ganapati Homam to some other homam, i \ncan only say that it depends upon individual. once can have strong \nintuition/urge to switch to some other deity. some people might get indirect \nor direct indications. i do not know about the criteria to fix a time frame \nfor switch. peronally for me, i am not having any such \nurge/intuition/indications till date and i have left it to my guru to \nsuggest if at all there needs a shift from Ganapati Homam to some other \nhomam (say Chandi Homam). however, i must say that i&#39;ve liking towards \nChandi homa.\n\nwarm regards,\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Anup Ray &lt;aray_usa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Pathakbhai,\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you please mention how long after your Ganapati homam did you move to \n&gt; Chandi path? Your timeline would help in giving a guideline timeframe.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen Narasimhaji and many others saying that after few months - you \n&gt; can move on to other homams. Are there any indications from within that we \n&gt; should be waiting for to get started? Would it vary from person to person?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m thinking too much unnecessarily.\n&gt;\n&gt; Warm Regards\n&gt; Anup Ray\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 18, 2009 1:01:53 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Time reduces as it passes !!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; I revisited some of my communications with my Guru. i started with my \n&gt; first Ganapati Havan on the first day of last Navaraatri. some useful \n&gt; extract from my message to narasimha is as below:\n&gt; [Y&#39;day Maha Ganapati homam was a Starting point on a Starting Day of \n&gt;  &gt;Navaraatri. It was all Krishnaarpanam. so how to say *I* performed? &gt;&gt;(As \n&gt; thakur says, this Rascal I never dies :-) it took me 2 hours. &gt;(excluding \n&gt; preparation & winding up)]\n&gt;\n&gt; Now the same procedure takes me around 1 hour including preparations.\n&gt; My message to my Guru about Chandi Homam ( one year back i.e. last \n&gt; navaratri):\n&gt; [Today chandi Homam took 3 hours 45 minutes even though i am very fluent \n&gt; in Chandi paath and quite comfortable with Devanagari.I think with \n&gt; Kavacha, Argalaaadi, it is very dificult to complete in 3 hours. let me \n&gt; see how can it be planned.]\n&gt; Now i am able to perform the same procedure (full as per manual) in 2 and \n&gt; Half hours.\n&gt; I reproduced it so that it might help for the aspirants who wish to start \n&gt; but worried about time management.\n&gt; Wish you all a very spiritual Navaraatri. may mother Durga start taking \n&gt; note of her children who are deparate to become purer.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
