Wajid Ali Shah - the nawab of Oudh was one such per=\r\nson. Vimalananda says he was a Kinnara who had incarnated on this plane. Qu=\r\nite possible. He used to go mad for love of Krishna and keep playing teh da=\r\nnce of Gopis for Krishna. Although he used to do his five times=C2=A0Namaz =\r\nas well. There were other such Sufis too I have heard who were devoted to K=\r\nrishna.\n=C2=A0\nThat is what Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, men=\r\n are God, hills are God, Sun, moon and everything is God while We say that =\r\neverything is of Allah (God).\n=C2=A0\nTrust Dr Naik when he is speaking on t=\r\nhe Koran. Do not trust him when he speaks on anything else. He does know hi=\r\ns Koran well.\n=C2=A0\nLook at this logically. Islam considers Muhammed to be=\r\n Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. If that perfected man could not have a d=\r\nirected communion with Allah ever, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril i=\r\nn Arabic) as in intermediary,=C2=A0why should any=C2=A0other muslim ever ha=\r\nve a direct connection with Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nThere is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nActually as far as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fa=\r\nllen by ego. The entities which live by fire as per Islam are called the Ji=\r\nnns. They are another class who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from f=\r\nire. They supposedly carry information from earth to the heavens and use fi=\r\nre as a tool for the same.\n=C2=A0\nOften muslim tantriks and Islamic occult =\r\npractitioner use Jinns for different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exa=\r\nct correspondence to Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I =\r\nknow people who do actually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Mayb=\r\ne they are something like spirits or beings of some astral plane. \n=C2=A0\nH=\r\nowever, one who does Homa need for a=C2=A0 deity need not worry about these=\r\n in the least. When a deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothi=\r\nng else will dare interfere.\n=C2=A0\nBut the real reason why most muslims ha=\r\nve an issue with fire is because in one Hadith it is mentioned prophet Muha=\r\nmmed disliked fire because it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire to them is a s=\r\nymbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs will be thrown by =\r\nAllah into a huge fire.\n=C2=A0\nsadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zak=\r\nir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different directions or actually they=\r\n try to make it such that they never meet.\n=C2=A0\nHmm, I would beg to disag=\r\nree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies =\r\nand use half truths when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes co=\r\nrrectly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideol=\r\nogy - specially Hindus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C2=A0 An exp=\r\nlanation for this maybe digressing and long.\n=C2=A0\nBut generally, if I wer=\r\ne born in a muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day =\r\nin and day out and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhamme=\r\nd as the perfected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I wou=\r\nld consider Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamen=\r\ntal that unless one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there=\r\n cannot be a reconciliation.\n=C2=A0\nRemember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing =\r\nthe koran for 9 years. At the end of the nine years he started his temple d=\r\nemolishion campaign.\n\n\nIt is no wonder that more than 90 percent of muslim =\r\nyouth, even those highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a gift of Allah=\r\n to the Ummah and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and &#39;comparitive religion=\r\ns&#39; alive on earth. I am speaking from personal interaction. \n=C2=A0\nAt some=\r\n point I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I don&#39;t. I find them to b=\r\ne a victim more than any one, and a victim who is not even aware of the fac=\r\nt that he is a victim! A victim not of USA=C2=A0 or Zionists or Hindus or a=\r\nnyone. A victim of the idea called Islam.\n=C2=A0\nThe above statement may se=\r\nem controversial, but it is not a casual remark.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Raja=\r\nrshi\n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava =\r\n- Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Poetry of Bulle Shah - Sufi\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Th=\r\nursday, 19 November, 2009, 7:33 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nDear Rajarshi,\n\nThank you f=\r\nor these informations on Sufis.

As you can well understand from his poetry, his realization was quite=\r\n different from traditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked=\r\n by muslims of his time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Mos=\r\nt people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C2=A0to be a branch of Islam. My person=\r\nal view is different. In most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sant=\r\ns like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me=\r\n that their personal realization was quite different from Islamic doctrins.=\r\n As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian and In=\r\ndia. The mystics of these areas, specially Persia, after it was over run by=\r\n Islam, in order to protect their philosophy garbed it with Islamic termino=\r\nlogies and names. Otherwise they would have faced sure shot slaughter. That=\r\n was a means of self preservation which in turn, over years, helped a lot o=\r\nf muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=C2=A0than that which com=\r\nes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; For example Rumi talk=\r\ns a about something similar to=C2=A0reincarnation in some of his poems whil=\r\ne the following one does talk about communion with God:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I search=\r\ned for God among the Christians and on the Cross and therein I found Him no=\r\nt.\n&gt; I went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there=\r\n.\n&gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but=\r\n God I found not.\n&gt; With set purpose I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasu=\r\ns and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.\n&gt; Then I directed my search to t=\r\nhe Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God was not there even.\n&gt; Turning to=\r\n philosophy I inquired about him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his=\r\n range.\n&gt; I fared then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great =\r\ndivine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God wa=\r\ns not there even in that exalted court.\n&gt; Finally, I looked into my own hea=\r\nrt and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Communion with God =\r\nis an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always seper=\r\nate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses=\r\n Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all th=\r\nat was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; The person who changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=\r\n=C2=A0 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Sh=\r\nams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caugh=\r\nt up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and s=\r\naid, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few=\r\n times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; an=\r\nd the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - id=\r\neally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam =\r\n- and executed him.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who=\r\n was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth=\r\n. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in In=\r\ndia. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva =\r\nfor a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Generally, except for the fam=\r\nous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis sai=\r\nnt. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more subjective inte=\r\nrpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled.=\r\n Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not =\r\nblame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell you in=\r\n no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God commu=\r\nnion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ails I=\r\nslam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional and a=\r\nuthentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are=\r\n quite famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual =\r\nhigher middle class.

He u=\r\nsed to go mad for love of Krishna and keep playing teh dance of Gopis for K=\r\nrishna. Although he used to do his five times&nbsp;Namaz as well. There wer=\r\ne other such Sufis too I have heard who were devoted to Krishna.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;That is what Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is =\r\nGod, men are God, hills are God, Sun, moon and everything is God while We s=\r\nay that everything is of Allah (God).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;Trust Dr Naik when he is speaking on the Koran. Do not trust him when=\r\n he speaks on anything else. He does know his Koran well.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Look at this logically. Islam considers Muhammed to be &lt;STRONG&gt;=\r\nInsan&lt;/STRONG&gt;-&lt;STRONG&gt;e&lt;/STRONG&gt;-&lt;STRONG&gt;Kamil, &lt;/STRONG&gt;the perfected man=\r\n. If that perfected man could not have a directed communion with Allah ever=\r\n, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermediary,&nbs=\r\np;why should any&nbsp;other muslim ever have a direct connection with Allah=\r\n? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;There=\r\n is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Actually as far as I know - I maybe wrong=\r\n - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The entities which live by fire as =\r\nper Islam are called the Jinns. They are another class who mostly dwell in =\r\nthe smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry information from eart=\r\nh to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for=\r\n different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hindu=\r\n terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do actuall=\r\ny use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Maybe they are something like =\r\nspirits or beings of some astral plane. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Howev=\r\ner, one who does Homa need for a&nbsp; deity need not worry about these in =\r\nthe least. When a deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothing e=\r\nlse will dare interfere.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But the real reason w=\r\nhy most muslims have an issue with fire is because in one Hadith it is ment=\r\nioned prophet Muhammed disliked fire because it reminded him of Hellfire. F=\r\nire to them is a symbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs =\r\nwill be thrown by Allah into a huge fire.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;=\r\nsadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree ap=\r\nart in different directions or actually they try to make it such that they =\r\nnever meet.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hmm, I would beg to =\r\ndisagree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only =\r\nlies and use half truths when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quot=\r\nes correctly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic =\r\nideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.&nbsp; A=\r\nn explanation for this maybe digressing and long.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;But generally, if I were born in a muslim family, and were made to read=\r\n teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day out and trust the Koran as the perfec=\r\nted word of God and Muhammed as the perfected man, one whose whole life was=\r\n teh Koran in motion, I would consider Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The =\r\ndifferences are so fundamental that unless one is ready to whitewash and ig=\r\nnore a LOT of things, there cannot be a reconciliation.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Remember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing the koran for 9 years. At =\r\nthe end of the nine years he started his temple demolishion campaign.&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It is no wonder that more than 90 percent of muslim y=\r\nouth, even those highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a gift of Allah =\r\nto the Ummah and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and &#39;comparitive religions=\r\n&#39; alive on earth. I am speaking from personal interaction. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;At some point I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I do=\r\nn&#39;t. I find them to be a victim more than any one, and a victim who is not =\r\neven aware of the fact that he is a victim! A victim not of USA&nbsp; or Zi=\r\nonists or Hindus or anyone. A victim of the idea called Islam.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The above statement may seem controversial, but it is not =\r\na casual remark.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Raj=\r\narshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCo=\r\nurier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consci=\r\nousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STR=\r\nONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5=\r\npx; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: vedi=\r\nc_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Poet=\r\nry of Bulle Shah - Sufi&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursd=\r\nay, 19 November, 2009, 7:33 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv771346084&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for these informations on Sufis.

As you can well understand from his poetry, his realization was =\r\nquite different from traditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite dis=\r\nliked by muslims of his time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most people consider Sufism or Sufiana&nbsp;to be a branch of=\r\n Islam. My personal view is different. In most of the poetry I have read of=\r\n famous Sufi sants like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB=\r\n Rumi convince me that their personal realization was quite different from =\r\nIslamic doctrins. As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in pre Islam=\r\nic Persian and India. The mystics of these areas, specially Persia, after i=\r\nt was over run by Islam, in order to protect their philosophy garbed it wit=\r\nh Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise they would have faced sure sho=\r\nt slaughter. That was a means of self preservation which in turn, over year=\r\ns, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more sublime path\n - IMHO -&nbsp;t=\r\nhan that which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; For example Rumi talks a about something similar to&nbsp;reincarna=\r\ntion in some of his poems while the following one does talk about communion=\r\n with God:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I searched for God among the Christians a=\r\nnd on the Cross and therein I found Him not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I went into the ancien=\r\nt temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I entered the mou=\r\nntain cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; With set purpose I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found the=\r\nre only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba,=\r\n the resort of old and young; God was not there even.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Turning to ph=\r\nilosophy I inquired about him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his ra=\r\nnge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I fared then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a gre=\r\nat divine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39;\n distance from him&quot; but Go=\r\nd was not there even in that exalted court.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally, I looked into =\r\nmy own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The c=\r\nreator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. =\r\nThough in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpr=\r\netation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic =\r\ngarb. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The person who changed the lif=\r\ne of Rumi was also another Sufi called&nbsp; Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda m=\r\nentions a popular legend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild ra=\r\nise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demons=\r\ntrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;=\r\n. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Fina=\r\nlly he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and\n the dead body woke up. Immediate t=\r\nhe Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for h=\r\nelp other than Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for procla=\r\niming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. This statement is also=\r\n considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Auliya N=\r\nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India. It is sai=\r\nd he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva for a son befo=\r\nre Shivaji was born.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Generally, except for the famou=\r\ns&nbsp;Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis saint=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more subje=\r\nctive interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were nev=\r\ner fooled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And=\r\n I do not blame them. An honest\n reading of the Koran and the hadiths with =\r\ntell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort o=\r\nf God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of =\r\nwhat ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, tradit=\r\nional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find the=\r\n fashionably spiritual higher middle class. But like most things under the =\r\nsun, they hardly know anything about anything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Rega=\r\nrds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Subject:\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: Poetry of Bulle Shah - Sufi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday=\r\n, 19 November, 2009, 5:21 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Some years back =\r\nthis specific poem of Baba Bulle Shah - a sufi &gt;mystic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ncan you provid me knowledge of this Sufi sect. is it one of the branch from=\r\n Islam?.
