However, I have always practiced Gayatri mantra the way it is given in original Vedic texts and whatever I experienced was with that. I never considered the other versions. So I have no comment.\n \n2) I am not aware of this view and practice.\n \nGoddess Swaahaa being the shakti of Agni, Agni acts through swaahaa. Whenever we use Agni for a work (e.g. carrying an oblation to Savita or some other deity), it is a good idea to think of Agni&#39;s shakti. So adding swaahaa at the end of mantras is customary.\n \nHowever, ideally speaking, even if you just say a mantra without swaahaa and make an offering, but having the mental intention that Agni should carry that oblation to a deity, won&#39;t Agni know it and act on it? If you do not specifically say the name of Swaahaa devi, won&#39;t Agni&#39;s shakti be invoked?\n \nSo, some people may advocate skipping swaahaa at the end of some Veda mantras, so that those who are not comfortable with the rules may use wrong intonation on the last syllable. After all, if you add &quot;swaahaa&quot; to a Veda mantra, the intonation of the last syllables may have to change accordingly and some people may not know. Instead of explicitly acknowledging Mother Swaahaa and messing up the intonation of the Veda mantra, some may think it better to not explicitly acknowledge Mother Swaahaa and be safe with the intonation.\n \n3) Never worry about offending me and feel free to be frank. Learned persons like you are always humble and have saattwik intentions.\n \nGenerally speaking, Ganapathi atharvaseersham, Narayana sooktam, Chandipath, Savitru Gayatri mantra etc are all very similar in spirit and essence, but there are subtle differences.\n \nGayatri mantra stresses the absolute Truth that all is supreme consciousness. Chandipath stresses that all is supreme consciousness manifesting as various beings and things (&quot;aham vibhutyaa bahubhiriha rUpairyadA sthitA&quot;), but also acknowledges that there is doubt regarding that and explains how that doubt is overcome. Gayatri mantra is about the end target and Chandipath is about the end target and also a path to it.\n \nCertain sadhanas like Chandi homam can clear the undesired conditioning powerfully and maximize one&#39;s experience with various other mantras.\n \nEven with various impurities in one&#39;s consciousness, one may be able to experience *something* with Gayatri mantra japam (or some other such staple mantra) and that can be enough to *sustain* one&#39;s spiritual life. However, Chandi homam can clear the impurities further and help one experience higher. One with weak digestion may eat a sumptuous food item and digest it reasonably, but, if the same person takes herbs that improve one&#39;s digestion, one can digest better.\n \nWe are living in deeply polluted times, both materially and spiritually. There are negative influences all around us. It is very difficult to remain free from them. If one is capable of handling sadhana of an ugra devata such as Chandi, it can help in accelerating one&#39;s spiritual progress.\n \nOf course, sadhana of any deity will help eventually in cleansing one&#39;s consciousness. One should in the end feel comfortable with the sadhana one does and feel some attachment.\n \nBest regards\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a couple of doubts regarding the gAyatrI mantra and homam.\n&gt; Since you have previously written about having performed homam with\n&gt; this mantra for several months, I hope that you can guide me with my\n&gt; upAsanA.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) nichRd-gAyatrI vs. gAyatrI -- In the book &quot;gAyatrI-bhAShyam&quot; by\n&gt; Ganapati Sastri, he opines that the nichRd-gAyatrI is used only for\n&gt; japa, and &quot;Nya&quot; is to be extended to &quot;Niya&quot; in homam etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) svAhA -- In another book, Mutthu Shroutigal says that the\n&gt; svAhA-kAra is to be excluded -- pratyekam [Ahutim] gAyatryA agnau\n&gt; AdadhyAt (AdadhyAt iti vacanAt na svAhAkAraH). He gives the full form\n&gt; of the mantra, and lengthens &quot;Nya&quot; just like Ganapati Sastri.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you please share your opinion and reasoning on both of these?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) You have repeatedly written that the gAyatrI-mantra is your &quot;food&quot;.\n&gt; You also wrote that you did the gAyatrI-homam for several months,\n&gt; after which you settled upon the chaNDI-homam. Given that the power of\n&gt; the gAyatrI mantra is unfathomable, and is akin to food, why take up\n&gt; another homam? I truly ask this with all humility to better inform my\n&gt; own choices.\n&gt; \n&gt; [ If you reply publically, please remove my name. ]\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
