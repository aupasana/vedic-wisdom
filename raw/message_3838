I have asked others ( people I found capable of answering)=\r\n this questions and gotten interesting answers.\n\nWhat I found is, any type =\r\nof sadhana homam, japan, reading chandi paath\nor any remedial measures are =\r\nvery important and one must do more and \nmore as capacity and capability pe=\r\nrmits while always focusing on bhava, as bhava is the quality parameter it =\r\nis more important than even pronounciation or time of japam  i.e 1 mala ver=\r\nsus 10 mala for example. Always try to increase the bhava and not other phy=\r\nsical parameters like doing japam for 2 hours versus 30 minutes or doing ho=\r\nman daily versus weekly etc. Many times when we try to stick to a rigourous=\r\n schedule like doing daily atleast I have felt that many of those days the =\r\n&quot;bhava&quot; is missing or mind is somewhere else.\nEach individual can select wh=\r\nat is best for him or her, I donot suggest any one way.\n\nThe &quot;bhava&quot; is mos=\r\nt important measure and that needs to be increased or improved all the time=\r\n. I could be one of the measures.\n\nAlmost most of the time while one starts=\r\n or appears to feel that journey on the path of sprituality is started, it =\r\nis associated with increase in ego or other attributes that may make one ca=\r\nreless.\nSometimes even getting a realized guru brings these distractions to=\r\no.\n\nThis is all play of maya or the chit vikara or accumulated sanskars in =\r\nthe mind. This has to play out, I am not sure one should attempt to avoid i=\r\nt.\n\nComing back to the question, what I have found and has seen stressed ve=\r\nry little everywhere these days is what I call &quot; Vaivhara Suddhi&quot; or conduc=\r\nt\nin mind, physical form and other things. Vaivhara Suddhi opens the doors =\r\nfor Chit Suddhi or cleansing of the mind.\n\nDoing all sadhana helps indirect=\r\nly to start on the journey of &quot;Vaivhara Suddhi&quot;, But there is direct way to=\r\no and one can practise it directly like any sadhana on a  24 by 7 basis. It=\r\n is also a sadhana.\n\n \nIt is only with Vaivhara Suddhi&quot; one can cleanse the=\r\n mind or Chitta. It is needed in the begining, middle and end, i.e. all tim=\r\nes.\n\nOnce one cultivates, it becomes a true nature of oneself and then it i=\r\ns always there but getting there is very long journey.\n\nThere are two aspec=\r\nts of chit suddhi, one is removing what is accumulated and stopping to accu=\r\nmulate more sanskars.\n\nVaivhara Suddhi helps in stopping to accumulate more=\r\n and the other sadhanas that one does helps in removing the accumated sansk=\r\nars.\n\nSo both go hand in hand, doing one without other is no good,\nit just =\r\nadds more accumulations in the chitta.\n\n\nAlong with doing sadhana, one need=\r\ns to integrate as many aspects of \n&quot;Vaivhara Suddhi&quot; like karma yoga, good =\r\nbehavoir, not getting angry\nnot screaming, forgiving, helping nature withou=\r\nt any expectation, a disciplined life style, accept things as they are etc.=\r\n Again one can make a list of 10 limitations that one has, be genuine and h=\r\nonest to oneself.\n\nSome of the above can be monitored and one can overcome =\r\nto a great extent by trying hard doing introspection of oneself.\n\nOne can s=\r\nelect the top 10 limitations in oneself and try to focus on them or to star=\r\nt with adopt 10 things and try to perfect them.\n\nOne saint suggeseted pledg=\r\ning everymorning and checking everynight\nadd the pluses and minuses and see=\r\n how to avoid minuses.\n\nHe also suggested in this journey one will fall dow=\r\nn many times but\nas soon as one falls down, one should get up and try again=\r\n to move forward.\n\nThe progress here in some ways is measurable how ever I =\r\nmust submit there is always a long way to go, it may take many lifetimes.\n\n=\r\nI have observed that as soon as one starts on this and becomes serious\nmore=\r\n challenges seem to come his or her way :-) my experiance\n\nSometimes when y=\r\nou try to do good, you get a lot of bad in return, may be it is all part of=\r\n cleansing :-).\n\n\nI just narated a few observations of mine, I am sure I di=\r\nd not answer your question here :-) ...... Enjoy the day\n\nBest Regards on a=\r\n wonderful day of Akasya Trutiya\nPlease ignore any spelling deficiancies.\n\n=\r\nMitesh\n \n&gt; I sincerely wish to surrender to Mother completely. I am trying =\r\nhard. I wish to surrender my ego, anger, passions as well as all good quali=\r\nties....\n&gt; \n&gt; How to achieve it effectivey? How to measure it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n\n\n\n"}}
