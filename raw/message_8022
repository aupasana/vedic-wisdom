I fear some questions might be silly, you could answer s=\r\nhortly or just with yes/no when it is appropriate.\n\n1. Can I perform a homa=\r\nm in a bedroom floor? Or would be be disrespectful since husband and wives =\r\nsleep in that room?\n\n2. One drop of seasame oil / some other oil and one pi=\r\nnch of turmeric powder / vermillion powder are to be mixed with uncooked ri=\r\nce to make Akshata. What if the quantity of uncooked rice is a little much,=\r\n then should I use *a few drops* of oil and *a few pinches of vermillion* w=\r\nith it to keep a well proportion and keep it sticky? Or is the condition st=\r\nrictly *one drop* and *one pinch* no matter now much the amount of rice is?=\r\n\n\n3. Were you doing a Gyana-Mudra while performing achamanam in the Maha Ga=\r\nnapati Homam video?\n\n4. You have listed camphor in the optional list of mat=\r\nerials. So if camphor is not available, what is the recommended procedure t=\r\no light the fire in homa-kunda?\n\n5. On the east of the homa kunda, we keep =\r\na plate, and some uncooked rice on it to make a small pile and Lord Sani&#39;s =\r\nidol or the coin over the rice. But since the idol/coin is optional, I can =\r\nskip keeping it and I guess then there is no need for keeping the plate and=\r\n rice also. (Since the rice is to keep the idol on it, I guess?] Am I corre=\r\nct?\n\n6. After giving fire to homa kunda\n\n(A) there is a mantra requesting a=\r\ngni to take the auspicious form [jataveda] and to convey the offerings to t=\r\nhe Gods.\n\nthen\n\n(B) there is a small mantra which we repeat 8 times and mak=\r\ne offerings to make the fire pure.\n\nIn the short version you have instructe=\r\nd to do (A) in one&#39;s mother tongue and skipped (B). But since the mantra of=\r\n (B) is very short and easy to remember, can I still do it with the mantra =\r\nwhile doing (A) simply with my mother tongue?\n\n7. While you have taken aksh=\r\nata in left hand, the palm seemed to have kept facing upwards and then when=\r\n the akshata in right hand, the palm was kept downwards. Is there any rules=\r\n like so? Or can I keep it any way I want?\n\n8. What to do with the akshata =\r\n(that I used in pranayama) after finishing the homa? Also, what to do with =\r\nthe unused akshata (remaining in the main pot) after I finish the homa?\n\n9.=\r\n I think the Sanskrit word for &#39;offering&#39; is &#39;Ahuti&#39;. Would you please tell=\r\n me the Sanskrit word for &#39;invoke&#39; (such as, in the fire)?\n\n10. In the main=\r\n homam, we say &#39;vaushat&#39; instead of &#39;svaha&#39; in the last repetition of the m=\r\nantra when we are going to start another mantra. What if I do the main homa=\r\nm with one mantra only (and then move to naivedyam)... Do I still say &#39;vaus=\r\nhat&#39; instead of &#39;svaha&#39; on the last time of repetition?\n\n11. I understand t=\r\nhat the cooked rice or fruit used in Shuddhanna Bali should not be consumed=\r\n. Here did you mean *ONLY THOSE six chunks* of cooked rice / the *six piece=\r\ns* of fruits *PLACED IN THE SIX PLACES* should not be eaten? Or does it ALS=\r\nO INCLUDE the remaining fruits in the main store of fruits with me from whe=\r\nre I was taking fruits to offer in fire also?\n\nTo illustrate, please let me=\r\n assume that I took total 300 grams of apple while I started the homam.\n\nA.=\r\n 100 grams apple I have offered in the fire, so burnt.\n\nB. 60 grams apple I=\r\n have offered to Naivedyam, and after offering a bit from it in the fire, I=\r\n kept it separately as blessed foods. I can consume it and share it with ot=\r\nhers.\n\nC. 40 grams of apples were those six pieces those I placed in the si=\r\nx places for shuddhanna bali. I can&#39;t eat them. I will throw them away to t=\r\nhe bin after the homam.\n\nD. 20 grams of apples offered in purnahuti, burnt.=\r\n\n\nE. 80 grams of apple is still on the bowl that remains fully unused (from=\r\n the initial 300 grams) after the homa completes.\n\nSince you wrote in the m=\r\nanual &quot;Any fruit pieces left over after bali should be thrown away&quot; so does=\r\n this &quot;non-eatable fruits&quot; mean ONLY the fruits in &quot;C&quot; or does it mean the =\r\nfruits it C+E also?\n\nIn case it meant only &quot;C&quot;, what is recommended for the=\r\n fruits of &quot;E&quot;? or should all the fruits of D+E is to be actually given to =\r\npurnahuti, that I can&#39;t leave any of the fruits unused that I sat with?\n\n12=\r\n. In the video you have said the mantra of purnahuti while holding the half=\r\n-copra with hand on your head. But in the manual its written to put it on t=\r\nhe ladle while saying the mantra. So can I just do it with the hand as you =\r\ndid in the video?\n\n13.\n\n(A) What do I do with the ghee that is left unused =\r\nafter the homam finishes? Can I simply put it back in the fridge to use it =\r\nfor later homams?\n\n(B) What to do with the water in the pot after the homam=\r\n finishes? \n\n(C) Since the ash at the kunda is sacred, what to do with it? =\r\nI mean, if i simply throw it off somewhere while cleaning, won&#39;t it be disr=\r\nespectful?\n\nAnyone sharing their knowledge will be also appreciated.\n\nThank=\r\ns,\nTanvir\n\n\n"}}
