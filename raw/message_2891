So please do not c=\r\nompare yourself to him, at least not as of now. I take inspiration from him=\r\n and try to better myself , perhaps you should consider doing the same thin=\r\ng, just a suggestion :).\n\nPlease keep trying and trying, and I am sure, one=\r\n day you will reach the speed. More importantly, the bhaava (emotion) is im=\r\nportant! Focussing on speed makes it more mechanical and devoid of emotions=\r\n.\n\nHowever, I totally empathize with you and can only say out of experience=\r\n, that if you focus and try, then you will see an improvement in yourself e=\r\nvery week. Try to benchmark it. \n\nMost importantly please make a sincere pr=\r\nayer to the GREAT GODESS herself to help you out! SHE will definitely answe=\r\nr your prayers, based on my personal experience.\n\n\nHere&#39;s wishing you all t=\r\nhe best in your spiritual endeavors.\n\nWarm Regards\nNarayan\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear gur=\r\nu ji,\n&gt;              pranam\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;       I Wish you a very-2 Happy , colo=\r\nurful and prosperous Diwali\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;              Pls guide me about chandi =\r\npath, how to read as alraedy i am doing Vishnu sahasranam daily with naraya=\r\nn kavacham\n&gt; \n&gt; 1]  You have once written that u take 45 min to complete 13=\r\n chapters but once i tried , it took me 45 min for 1 st 3 chapters, how u r=\r\nead so fast\n&gt; \n&gt; 2] If i try and read 100 verses daily completing 700 verse=\r\ns in a week , is it ok or wrong\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; rakesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Homam wi=\r\nth the veda mantra \n&gt; &gt; &quot;kayaanschitra&quot; was suggested by Maharshi Parasara =\r\nfor relief from problems \n&gt; &gt; with Rahu. Some people also use Vyaasa&#39;s pour=\r\naanika mantra &quot;ardha kaayam&quot;. I \n&gt; &gt; will try to create Rahu and Ketu homam=\r\n manuals soon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2] Apart from doing Rahu homam or japam of Rahu man=\r\ntra, one can pray to \n&gt; &gt; Chandi or Durga. The 700 verses known as &quot;Devi Ma=\r\nahaatmyam&quot; (glory of the \n&gt; &gt; goddess) or &quot;Durga saptashati&quot; (Durga&#39;s 700) =\r\nor &quot;Chandipath&quot; (chanting of \n&gt; &gt; Chandi) are ideal. Those who are not flue=\r\nnt in Sanskrit and not willing to \n&gt; &gt; try at all can try Durga/Chandi sapt=\r\nashloki, which is a collection of 7 \n&gt; &gt; representative verses out of those=\r\n 700.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is possible to do a simple homam by using the Chandi homa=\r\nm manual on the \n&gt; &gt; website below and use just the saptashloki (7 verse) f=\r\nor pradhaana homam. \n&gt; &gt; Just invoke the goddess in fire, offer 5 upachaara=\r\ns, offer one aahuti to her \n&gt; &gt; parivaara devatas and then keep offering th=\r\nese 7 verses over and over, as \n&gt; &gt; many times as you can.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One can=\r\n also pray to Lord Venkaeswara or Balaji for relief from Rahu \n&gt; &gt; problems=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; J=\r\nyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; &lt;rakesh.behal@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 14, 2009 4:31 AM\n&gt; &gt; Sub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] query\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear guru ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   charan sap=\r\narsh\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1] Pls design homa for rahu\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2] pls also sugges=\r\nt which sadhna are best to control rahu and avoid its \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad effects\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rakesh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
