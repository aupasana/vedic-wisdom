They can be repaid i=\r\nn many ways. But five different debts and five specific ways to repay have =\r\nbeen identified in scriptures:\n\n \n\n(1) Deva rina (debt to divine beings): M=\r\nake offerings in fire to divine beings such as Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya etc=\r\n, while praying for the strength and happiness of those beings.\n\n(2) Pitri =\r\nrina (debt to ancestral manes): Offer tarpanas through specific chakras (en=\r\nergy centers) in the palm, while praying for the freedom of ancestors from =\r\nblockages.\n\n(3) Rishi rina (debt to seers): Study Vedas, upanishads, script=\r\nures and wise writings and transform one&#39;s thinking and attitude.\n\n(4) Manu=\r\nshya rina (debt to other human beings): Serve others. Offer food, knowledge=\r\n, services etc and serve humanity.\n\n(5) Bhoota rina (debt to other beings):=\r\n  Feed animals, birds and other beings and take care of them with kindness.=\r\n\n\n \n\nOf course, one can make offerings to rishis in fire or offer tarpanas =\r\nto rishis (if you see the Tarpana manuals at the website below, you&#39;ll see =\r\nsections on Deva tarpana and Rishi tarpana!). However, the best way to repa=\r\ny the debt to seers is to transform one&#39;s attitude through study,  contempl=\r\nation and assimilation of knowledge.\n\n \n\nWe are a microcosm of the entire u=\r\nniverse. Devas, pitris, rishis, manushyas and bhutas are within us. Devas w=\r\nithin us are happy when undesirable conditioning within us is burnt in the =\r\nfire of wisdom and we are guided by wisdom always. Pitris within us are hap=\r\npy when weaknesses and blockages within are flushed and mind becomes conten=\r\nted. Rishis (seers) within us are happy when we have a clear vision of righ=\r\nt and wrong. The corresponding rituals and practices try to bring the requi=\r\nred internal changes through resonance.\n\n \n\nPitri tarpana is a very simple =\r\nritual. Find the manuals at the website below. It is ideal for repaying the=\r\n debts to pitris. While doing the ritual, sincerely pray that your ancestor=\r\ns stuck due to desires be freed from the desires, so they can move on.\n\n \n\n=\r\nBest regards,\n\nNarasimha\n\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,=\r\n\n\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n\n     =\r\n             http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n     Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n=\r\n\n---- Ramesh Subramanian &lt;inkarmayoga@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Appreciat=\r\ne a response from Sri Rao and other wise persons in this forum for this que=\r\nstion in the message posted earlier (given below).\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; --- On Wed, 1/12=\r\n/10, Ramesh Subramanian &lt;inkarmayoga@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; From: Ramesh=\r\n Subramanian &lt;inkarmayoga@...&gt;\n\n&gt; Subject: Methods / Rituals to neu=\r\ntralize Pitru Rinam\n\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n\n&gt; Date: Wednesday,=\r\n 1 December, 2010, 3:54 PM\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; One has three types of Rinams towards Gods=\r\n, Rishis and Piturs.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; It seems the methods to neutralizing them are\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Prayer / Yajna / Puja,\n\n&gt; Adyayanam and\n\n&gt; Progeny\n\n&gt; respectively.\n\n=\r\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; My questions:\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; 1.
