You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That is=\r\n reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has nothing=\r\n to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and apply so=\r\nme force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction later.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0 \n&gt;&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt; Even a pe=\r\nrson of a high level of mental equanimity and stability does have an ego. E=\r\nach living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and =\r\nan identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and =\r\nso things, who does so and so things, who wants so and so things, who is th=\r\ne husband of Padmaja, who is the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is =\r\nthe sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If the binding is completely removed =\r\nand one becomes completely unbound from that limited sense of I-ness, one w=\r\nill no longer remain in the body. So any embodied being must have a limited=\r\n ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is c=\r\nut off from one body and environment and re-attached to another body and en=\r\nvironment. Nature tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail=\r\n addressed to your old apartment to your new apartment when you change addr=\r\ness, Nature delivers the reactions of all previous life\n actions to the sen=\r\nse of I-ness in this life.\n&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a s=\r\nense of I-ness, Nature will continue to deliver the reactions to various pr=\r\nevious actions from that being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Os=\r\ncar award, losing an election, being criticized by thousand people, being h=\r\nit by wife, being abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheat=\r\ned by a friend etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As lo=\r\nng as one&#39;s sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to del=\r\niver reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result =\r\nof previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or exc=\r\nited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good karm=\r\na is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW is=\r\n irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one should feel sa=\r\nd or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s bad karma is =\r\nmeaningful only if that\n reaction disappoints him. You cheated someone. Nat=\r\nure will arrange such that that person cheats you now. How you feel about i=\r\nt now is not relevant as far as the old action-reaction equation is concern=\r\ned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does not stop Nature from=\r\n doing its job.\n&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting t=\r\no what is happening now, one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated =\r\na person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to che=\r\nat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but i=\r\nf he does it with self-identification with the action, it becomes a new kar=\r\nma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it ca=\r\nlmly and without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, =\r\nsuppose you fight and try to stop the person from cheating you. Then your c=\r\nurrent actions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its react=\r\nion later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you=\r\n have to behave like the person you described below. Accept whatever comes =\r\nyour way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed mi=\r\nnd. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at the m=\r\noment, with as\n little self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) as =\r\npossible. As you become better at this, your instincts and judgment will gu=\r\nide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n--------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ hom=\r\nam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- \n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt;&gt;=A0 =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are=\r\n able to be in a neutral frame \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what is=\r\n percieved as misfortune?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his =\r\nwife in a road accident a few years \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.

Before I answer it=\r\n, I want to say that I am impressed with the decription of your friend. My =\r\npranaams to him. Does he live in the greater Boston area too?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Karma and k=\r\narmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and being pushin=\r\ng back as a reaction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When you karmically pu=\r\nsh an object with some force and that object pushes you back karmically wit=\r\nh the same force at a later point of time, it is not necessary that you res=\r\nist it and apply some more force to push again. You pushed it earlier. That=\r\n is action. You are being pushed now. That is reaction. How you take this p=\r\nush and whether you resist or not has nothing to do with the old action and=\r\n reaction balance. IF you resist\n and apply some force NOW, it becomes a ne=\r\nw action which will get its reaction later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level=\r\n of mental equanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living person ha=\r\ns a limited ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PV=\r\nR Narasimha Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and so things, who does =\r\nso and so things, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja=\r\n, who is the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish=\r\n Pandit etc etc). If the binding is completely removed and one becomes comp=\r\nletely unbound from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain=\r\n in the body. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As on=\r\ne dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body=\r\n and environment and\n re-attached to another body and environment. Nature t=\r\nracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to your =\r\nold apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature deliver=\r\ns the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of I-ness in this=\r\n life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a =\r\nsense of I-ness, Nature will continue to deliver the reactions to various p=\r\nrevious actions from that being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an O=\r\nscar award, losing an election, being criticized by thousand people, being =\r\nhit by wife, being abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being chea=\r\nted by a friend etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As l=\r\nong as one&#39;s sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to de=\r\nliver reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result=\r\n of previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or ex=\r\ncited or\n elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good ka=\r\nrma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW =\r\nis irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one should feel =\r\nsad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s bad karma i=\r\ns meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. You cheated someone. Na=\r\nture will arrange such that that person cheats you now. How you feel about =\r\nit now is not relevant as far as the old action-reaction equation is concer=\r\nned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does not stop Nature fro=\r\nm doing its job.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that =\r\nway. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is preventing new karmas=\r\n. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arranged =\r\nfor that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction to =\r\nyour own action (but if he does it with self-identification with the action=\r\n,\n it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you).=\r\n If you just face it calmly and without doing anything, you finish off your=\r\n karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to stop the person from ch=\r\neating you. Then your current actions would become a NEW karma and you will=\r\n have to face its reaction later. If you want to pay off old debts without =\r\nincurring new ones, you have to behave like the person you described below.=\r\n Accept whatever comes your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but wit=\r\nh a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the rig=\r\nht thing to do at the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of =\r\n&quot;I am doing this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instinct=\r\ns and judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n ---------&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrol=\r\noger.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Karma&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimh=\r\naji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if th=\r\ney are able to be in a neutral frame &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be a=\r\nffected by what is percieved as misfortune?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few yea=\r\nrs &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.\n Her head was crashed into a pulp right before hi=\r\ns eyes.
