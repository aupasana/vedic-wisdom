Especially the solar eclipse of July 22 occurs when Su=\r\nn is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun&#39;s Mrityu Bhaga (death inflic=\r\nting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ke=\r\ntu and ascendant are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this can be a pro=\r\nblematic eclipse.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Eclipse time is a very favorable time for spiritu=\r\nal sadhana, though temple rituals are halted during eclipses. There is a re=\r\nason for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sun and Moon are the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supre=\r\nme cosmic being). Microcosmically, individual soul (Sun) and individual min=\r\nd (Moon) are the eyes through which we see the dual world around us. If ind=\r\nividual soul and individual mind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any=\r\n objects in the field of duality. The objectification within Brahman ceases=\r\n and one is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In ot=\r\nher words, one realizes Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To fulfil one&#39;s dharma as an individu=\r\nal in the field of duality, one needs to be awake to the duality. One needs=\r\n the individualized consciousness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclips=\r\ne time when Sun or Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. T=\r\nemples and temple rituals, which are performed for collective dharma of soc=\r\niety, are understandably halted. However, it is a great time for spiritual =\r\nsadhana for self-realization. This applies to homam as well. If one perform=\r\ns homam for material benefits, one should stop during an eclipse. However, =\r\nif one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-realization, a homam =\r\nperformed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at other times. One =\r\ncan perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra d=\r\nevata may work better.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
