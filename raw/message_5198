Moreover, it is a relatively modern text and not immune to corruption.\n \nAs for Vedas, Brahmanas etc, they have been immune to corruptions. But it is not even worth considering their translations by today&#39;s scholars, let alone pseudo-scholars and propagandists.\n \nIn Vedas and associated literature, cows and horses frequently refer to jnanendriyas and karmendriyas of manas. For example, horse roaming the whole universe unconquered and then being sacrificed in fire (i.e. ashwamedha yaGYa) is symbolic of being able to perform ANY karma while giving up the sense of doership completely and surrendering it to god.\n \nOne who reconstructs English language based on some books after 1,000 years may read a line that says &quot;so and so person had foot in his mouth&quot; and imagine that a person really put the foot in his mouth. Sadly, idiomatic and, more importantly, symbolic expression is common in Vedic literature. See Aurobindo&#39;s thoughts on this in &quot;Secret of the Veda&quot;.\n \nHinduism is a living religion. One cannot interpret its texts in isolation of the notions grasped from observing the living religion.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I came across some references by some indologists say that cow sacrfice and/or \n&gt; beef eating was prevalant in ancient India.

Everyday he \n&gt; distributed the meat and food and earned fame. For the performance of the ritual \n&gt; of FOUR MONTHS (caaturmaasyam), everyday animals are killed. In the next verses \n&gt; Dharma Vyadha (butcher) expressed the view that no sin attaches to the King and \n&gt; Brahmins when the animals are killed in a sacrifice.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2) Taittiriya Brahman supposedly says `Verily the cow is food&#39; (atho annam via \n&gt; gauh) and Yajnavalkya&#39;s insistence on eating the tender (amsala) flesh of the \n&gt; cow.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3) Here is an article that was written on the same.\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.indowindow.com/sad/article.php?child=17&article=11\n&gt;  \n&gt; Can someone kindly refute this in a logical manner?\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
