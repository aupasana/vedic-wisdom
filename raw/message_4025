They are parts of the sookshm=\r\na sareera (subtle body). Each vaayu is one kind of kinetic energy causing o=\r\nne kind of movement in awareness. Of course, each movement of subtle awaren=\r\ness is linked to movement of something in the gross physical body, i.e. the=\r\ny happen together.\n \nPraana vaayu is not merely oxygen. Praana vaayu is the=\r\n lifeforce that moves within the body and keeps each atom of the body alive=\r\n.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n \n---- &quot;Dr. A.

I =\r\nwill try to give some here\n&gt; \n&gt; Prana Vaayu: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) oxygen - This is give=\r\nn in modern context.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The energy causing Respiration: All the moveme=\r\nnts in body are caused by Vaayu. there are five different types of vaayu in=\r\n Body which cause different functions. These are Prana, Udana, samana, vyan=\r\na, apana. Out of these &#39;Prana vaayu&#39; helps in respiration. \n&gt; \n&gt; 3) The air=\r\n flowing in and out of lungs during the process of repiration (Inhalation a=\r\nnd exhalation) is also called Prana vaayu. As this air is essential for lif=\r\ne maintainance\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Cool, clean and dustfree air which flows in morning.=\r\n This is dustfree, pollution free and is moist. Due to this, this is consid=\r\nered good for health. \n&gt; \n&gt; Prana:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Life\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Some times it is al=\r\nso used for Prana-shakti. The Physical and mental energy stored in our body=\r\n. A type of this is termed as spiritual energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) The Inhalation and =\r\nexhalation process. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is advised to wakeup in Brahmmuhurta ( roughly=\r\n around 4:30 am, or about 30-45 minutes before sunrise) Because of followin=\r\ng reasons\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) This time is believed to be ruled by Devatas. So one gets=\r\n the blessings of devatas in this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) This time is believed to ha=\r\nve saatvik energy. This purifies the mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) This time air is dust fr=\r\nee, clean and without pollution. This purifies the body.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) During thi=\r\ns time All the doshas (Vaata-pitta and kapha) are in balanced proportion. S=\r\no our body is healthy and free from diseases. Waking too late will increase=\r\n kapha in body and waking too early will increase vaata in body. very commo=\r\nn problems like constipation, insomnia, depression, laziness, low immunity,=\r\n cold can be avoided and infact cured just by waking up in this time\n&gt; \n&gt; f=\r\nurther, During this time, the concentration of Oxygen is not so High that i=\r\nt will cause oxidation. For oxidation of cells, much higher concentration i=\r\ns needed. \n&gt; \n&gt; And, the concentration of CO2 and O2 never fluctuate too mu=\r\nch so that we have to worry about their concentration until and unless the =\r\ndifference is more than 10% in case of CO2 and 20% in case of O2. (These ar=\r\ne approx figures). With in this range we will not even notice any differenc=\r\ne in our surroundings or any type of discomfort.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope it helps.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Sorry for mistakes. \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Atul\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Swami vivekanada explains that=\r\n pranayama is about controlling the prana -life force \n&gt; &gt; see his exact wo=\r\nrds in his book Raja yoga\n&gt; &gt; While touring USA he spoke about prana and Et=\r\nher from Vedas\n&gt; &gt; he told space is filled with ether and ether can be turn=\r\ned into prana and vice versa\n&gt; &gt; the news paper published it \n&gt; &gt; the famou=\r\ns scientist Tesla saw this and wrote a letter to the Einstein couple\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne einstein couple contemplated on it and found the e=3Dmc2 formula of how m=\r\natter can be converted to energy and nuclear bomb was found\n&gt; &gt; so the worl=\r\nd believes Einstein found the theory of relativity while it was truly embed=\r\nded in Vedhas and Swami Vivekanda brought it to light to the world and the =\r\ncredit went to Einstein\n&gt; &gt; do a internet search and you can find the Swami=\r\ns publication in paper archives\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________=\r\n________\n&gt; &gt; From: MUKESH SONI &lt;mukesh_csp@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: trivedijv@...; maha=\r\nlaxmyey@...\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Mon, March 15, 2010 2:23:56 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Curiosity=\r\n ???  #1: If U know, Share !!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pl find updated query. it is a=\r\nlso posted at our yahoo group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pranaam!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Curiosity=\r\n ##1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;How more =C3=A2??Pran-Vayu=C3=A2?? blows in =C3=A2??brama-moohra=\r\nt=C3=A2?? ???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;I knew some facts through reading books that- \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;#:  More =C3=A2??Pran-Vayu=C3=A2?=C2=9D blows in =C3=A2??brama-moohrat=\r\n=C3=A2?? environment. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#:  =C3=A2??getup early=C3=A2?=C2=9D has more b=\r\neneficial to Mind body and soul. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#:  =C3=A2??brama-moohrat=C3=A2?=C2=\r\n=9D period is known before 2 hours of sun-rise. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#: =C3=A2??Pranvayu=\r\n=C3=A2?=C2=9D means Oxygen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;I also read - \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#: Oxygen is pr=\r\noduce through =C3=A2??photo-synthesis=C3=A2?=C2=9D in presence of sun. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;#: Production of oxygen done by Trees in day time only. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#: More =C3=\r\n=A2??Carbon-dioxide=C3=A2?=C2=9D is produce in night by trees. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#: Les=\r\ns oxygen! less efficiency !!! \n&gt; &gt; &gt;#: Less =C3=A2??oxygen=C3=A2?=C2=9D in =\r\nnight, more =C3=A2??carbon-dioxide=C3=A2?=C2=9D in night.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Because =\r\n there is no presence of sun !!! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;So, how more =C3=A2??Pran Vay=\r\nu=C3=A2?? !!! blows in=C3=A2??brama-moohrat=C3=A2?? ??? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am s=\r\neeking answer, if anyone has information, please share with us.    \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Yours \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Mukesh Soni  \n\n\n"}}
