Not only as an emperor of one of the greatest empires=C2=A0=\r\nin the world, but as a man of extreme sagacity and wisdom. Darius believed =\r\nin Ahura Mazda.

His army contained=C2=A0Arabs, Hindus, Pers=\r\nians, Jews=C2=A0etc=C2=A0and all lived in perfect harmony - each with his o=\r\nwn religious interpretations.

At the same time, some not-so-well- known t=\r\nemples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was very=\r\n impressed with the=C3=82=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=\r\ne is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamala=\r\ni (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual ener=\r\ngy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically=\r\n alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the=\r\n Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression =\r\nat the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; T=\r\nhere was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who=\r\n took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Sh=\r\nata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before an=\r\nd it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C3=82=C2=A0form of the div=\r\nine Mother=C3=82=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not=\r\n understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my =\r\neyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazz=\r\nled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like S=\r\nun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do no=\r\nt remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without=\r\n roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few tim=\r\nes, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally de=\r\ncided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 m=\r\nin and\n left\n&gt; in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone fro=\r\nm Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine pr=\r\nesence across India.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshi=\r\nneshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitt=\r\nhal temple at Aalandi near Pune.

These western countries are so =\r\nfilled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a go=\r\nod amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place t=\r\no meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples.

The modern day versions of both these faiths have deviated much fro=\r\nm the original messages.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In my a=\r\nnalysis Muhammed, was not an avatar by any stretch of imagination. I consid=\r\ner him to a historical leader, like an Alexander or a Napoleon, and like al=\r\nl leaders he had the ability to go out there among the masses and get the j=\r\nob done. This is where leaders differ from arm-chair philosophers. But I am=\r\n quite skeptical about Muhammed the &quot;spiritual leader&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my an=\r\nalysis - and I have spend substantial time studying the Koran, aHadiths, va=\r\nrious Tafsirs as well as the history of Islam&nbsp;- I found more politics =\r\nthan spirituality, right at the heart. However, this is not the right forum=\r\n to go into a detailed discussion on this topic, so I stop here.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Abrahamic faiths also do not b=\r\neleive in Reincarnation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I find the ten commandment of Moses -&nbsp;the crux of A=\r\nbrahamic religions - to be a supreme source of controversy and infact the v=\r\nery seed of fanaticsm is sown right inside there. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;I find studying the life of &lt;EM&gt;D=C4=81rayavahu=C5=A1 &lt;/EM&gt;(Darius I o=\r\nf ancient Persia) to be of more value than the ten commandments. Not only a=\r\ns an emperor of one of the greatest empires&nbsp;in the world, but as a man=\r\n of extreme sagacity and wisdom. Darius believed in Ahura Mazda. He said &quot;A=\r\nhura Mazda is truth&quot; and explained and understood this sentence of mean tha=\r\nt anything which is true is Ahura Mazda. Instead, if he had made a statemen=\r\nt that &quot; Ahura Mazda is the ONLY truth&quot; - he would have bred fanaticism. Th=\r\nat is why he had no religio-philosophical&nbsp;conflicts in helping the Jew=\r\ns to built their second temple as well as the Egyptians to build a temple o=\r\nf Ra. His army contained&nbsp;Arabs, Hindus, Persians, Jews&nbsp;etc&nbsp;a=\r\nnd all lived in perfect harmony - each with his own religious interpretatio=\r\nns. That is why he is the only non-Jew who has been accorded a special stat=\r\nus among the prophets of Jews in the Old Testament.He infact made it\n compu=\r\nlsory that every individual&nbsp;in his kingdom would undergo a training fo=\r\nr few years on three things&nbsp;before he would be free and productive&nbs=\r\np;in society - horse riding, shooting arrows and telling the truth! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;As I see it, Darius did what Moses could not a=\r\nnd he understood what Moses never could.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I apologize beforehand if any feathers are ruffled.&lt;/EM&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;My suggestion would be, don&#39;t worry abt r=\r\nuffling feathers.

At the same time, some not-so-well- known templ=\r\nes seem to have a powerful divine presence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I =\r\nwas very impressed with the=C3=82&nbsp;Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON he=\r\nad office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruv=\r\nannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spirit=\r\nual energy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is pra=\r\nctically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa l=\r\neft, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same\n im=\r\npression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was ta=\r\nken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nad=\r\nu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of=\r\n that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;form of the divine Mother=C3=82&nbsp;present there was a Tamil lan=\r\nguage name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now=\r\n. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front=\r\n of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face=\r\n was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there=\r\n. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, bu=\r\nt it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof ov=\r\ner the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each =\r\ntime\n and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.=\r\n Though we spent only 5 min and left&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a hurry, I was very pleased=\r\n with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the t=\r\nemple and goddess.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Like this, I am sure there =\r\nare many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my b=\r\nest experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aaland=\r\ni near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the u=\r\nnderground chamber there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is=\r\n better for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so=\r\n filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is\n a =\r\ngood amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place=\r\n to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples.=\r\n But some temples are really good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one has =\r\na chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I sug=\r\ngest the following:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Pu=\r\nri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills=\r\n)=C3=82&nbsp;and Narayana=C3=82&nbsp;vanam (near Tirupati)=C3=82&nbsp;in so=\r\nuth India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C3=82&nbsp;and Girnar mountains (Junaga=\r\ndh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Sr=\r\nisailam and Mantralayam=C3=82&nbsp;and Ujjain in central India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are many other good places, but the above come to m=\r\ny mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for several m=\r\nonths while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (l=\r\nike homam or japam)\n there is quite another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; B=\r\nest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/=\r\nA&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wi=\r\nsdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotis=\r\nh writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri\n tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Astro Seeker &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Respected Narsimhaji, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I w=\r\nould like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in today=\r\n&#39;s time.
