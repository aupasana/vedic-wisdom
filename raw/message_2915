If you are a =\r\nyoung person and never have done any healing workshops then it will be usef=\r\nul to you.\n&gt; One of my friend in Delhi has done it. The only thing is when =\r\nwe come back home I could not do the kriya breathing exercise on a regular =\r\nbasis.If you can do it then it can take you deep in meditation very easily.=\r\n\n&gt; If you do it let us know how was it.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On=\r\n Tue, 20/10/09, dahiyajiten &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: dahiyajiten=\r\n &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] AOL\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, 20 October, 2009, 19:09\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; Can anybo=\r\ndy tell me how good is the Art of Living course for our spiritual growth.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Jitender\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n|| Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
