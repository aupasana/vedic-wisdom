However, we cannot compare ourselves with special beings and we=\r\n should follow rules and austerities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may s=\r\ncore a century with a terrible backache, but we should not walk out to bat =\r\nwith a backache and should try to be healthy. After all, we may not be able=\r\n to score runs well even when in perfect health!\n \n*        *        *\n \nBy=\r\n the way, it must be realized that external rules are only meant as a *cata=\r\nlyst* in enabling internal transformation. The goal of all sadhana - medita=\r\ntion, japam, homam, bhajan, service to others etc - is internal transformat=\r\nion. If the internal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet to wor=\r\nk.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf a room has a window outside of which there is=\r\n heavy wind that is constantly blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweepin=\r\ng the room with a broom does not eliminate dirt. First close the window or =\r\nstop the wind. Similarly, praanaayaama is not enough to purify the nadis an=\r\nd give mental purity, if mind (room) is attached to the objects perceived b=\r\ny senses (window).\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf one reads scriptures and teac=\r\nhings of saints, contemplates on them, constantly analyzes inner motives be=\r\nhind various actions by oneself and tries to change one&#39;s own thinking slow=\r\nly, this process of contemplation and introspection will augment one&#39;s exte=\r\nrnal sadhana (such as meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, service etc) and pu=\r\nrifies one faster.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBy the way, it is useless to thi=\r\nnk in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kundalini and raising Kundalini. Such t=\r\nhoughts are almost guaranteed to either block Kundalini from rising or from=\r\n reaching the highest it can.\n \nKundalini shakti is essentially a symbol of=\r\n one&#39;s own self-awareness. Though one is the infinite Self (Purusha), one i=\r\ns &quot;aware&quot; of a limited object in the field of duality (Shakti) springing in=\r\n Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why Kundalini shakti is worshipped as a form of th=\r\ne divine Mother (Shakti). This self-awareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. =\r\none assumes that one is so and so person and so and so body without questio=\r\nning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is why Kundalini is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladha=\r\nra chakra (bhuloka or physical realm). As Kundalini awakens and rises to ot=\r\nher chakras (other lokas or realms of awareness), one&#39;s understanding of wh=\r\no one is gets refined. When Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one is aware of tr=\r\nue Self.\n \nIf one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at so=\r\n and so point in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in this b=\r\nody&quot;, it will focus and limit one&#39;s self-awareness to the *physical body* a=\r\nnd hence one&#39;s Kundalini will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to trul=\r\ny rise, one needs to completely forget about the physical body and stop thi=\r\nnking in terms of it.\n \nBy the way, *very few* people actually experience K=\r\nundalini in higher chakras, though many talk about it. Kundalini is in Mool=\r\naadhaara chakra or atmost Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even advanced=\r\n and awakened ones. When praana vaayu flows in some higher chakras, that to=\r\no can result in a powerful experience. Some may mistaken it for Kundalini.\n=\r\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you want a good score in the examination, study =\r\nwell. Stop thinking too much about (and anticipating) the examination and f=\r\nocus on the subject instead. Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about k=\r\nundalini, forget about chakras, forget about the body even. Do sadhana, do =\r\nsadhana and do sadhana. Read scriptures and teachings of great saints. Inst=\r\nead of looking externally and judging others, observe your own actions and =\r\nthoughts, analyze what is driving them and consciously try to eliminate wro=\r\nng motives that stem from false ego, adharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger,=\r\n greed, delusion, wantonness, jealosy), i.e. put to use the knowledge of sc=\r\nriptures and the teachings of saints. Oneday, Kundalini will rise automatic=\r\nally.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lesson=\r\ns, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n =\r\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &quot;For =\r\ninstance, without a vegetarian diet, asana siddhi is impossible.&quot;\n&gt; =C3=82 =\r\n\n&gt; Nothing is impossible.
