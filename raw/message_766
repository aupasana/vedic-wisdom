This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was \nrea=\r\nding a book on his life and various incidents connected to him as \nobserved=\r\n by other saints and his brother disciples.\n\nSwami Brahmananda or Rakhal Ma=\r\nharaj was the spiritual son of Thakur. \nAnd no doubt a great spiritual supe=\r\nr giant. Thakur used to say he \nwas one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates =\r\nwho had reincarnated on \nthis plane.\n\nDuring his stay in various monastarie=\r\ns of the Ramakrishna Mission, \noften other monks used to send new initiates=\r\n to Rakhal Maharaj for \nhios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea am=\r\nong the disciples \nof Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj =\r\nwill never \nagain be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya. \n\nOne da=\r\ny an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his \nblessings and said &quot;=\r\nMaharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a \nblessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly=\r\n Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you \npeople always come asking for Brahmachar=\r\nya? Was does not any one \ncome to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn&#39;t G=\r\nod the final aim of \neverything.. &quot;\n\nIs it possible for someone who cannot =\r\nmaintain brahmacharya to reach \nGod? I am puzzled...\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if y=\r\nou\n&gt; &gt; can remove my identity from this that would be appreciable\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok..=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda may have overcome lust after having his deity with \nhim. =\r\nSomeone \n&gt; else may have to first overcome his lust even to have a vision o=\r\nf \nthe deity. \n&gt; What is good for goose is not good for gander. In general,=\r\n it is \ngood to try \n&gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several &quot;no=\r\nrmal college going people&quot; were taken under his wings \nby \n&gt; Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa and transformed into spiritual giants. \nSwami \n&gt; Vivekananda, Swa=\r\nmi Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college \nstudents \n&gt; when they met=\r\n Ramakrishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of \n=\r\nRamakrishna&#39;s \n&gt; disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lu=\r\nst with \nhis \n&gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at a=\r\nll easy \nto kill \n&gt; completely.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thou=\r\nght does not go out of the \nmind. Set a \n&gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 1=\r\n08 days or some period like that \nand \n&gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Do=\r\nn&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does n=\r\not help in overcoming \nthe basic \n&gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nuppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; \n&gt; True, suppressing desire=\r\n will make the desire come back later. \nBut, if one \n&gt; keeps fulfilling des=\r\nires, they never end!!  This is the nature of \ndesire. \n&gt; Whether one desir=\r\nes money or knowledge (of anything other than \nSelf) or \n&gt; physical pleasur=\r\nes, the desire will never end no matter how much \none gets.\n&gt; \n&gt; Removing d=\r\nesire from the root often requires suppressing the \ndesire \n&gt; temporarily. =\r\nBut the thing to remember from the Aghora book is \nthat just \n&gt; suppressing=\r\n desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing \ndesires, but do \n&gt; remembe=\r\nr that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep \nworking on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; &gt; vimalan=\r\nanda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt; &gt; not in 6 yea=\r\nrs at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritual pr=\r\nogress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is \none thing. \n&gt; The most=\r\n fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become \nattached to \n&gt; things=\r\n. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions and \n&gt; developing =\r\na sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several =\r\nthings in spiritual progress. They all come \ntogether! One \n&gt; person may de=\r\nvelop detachment to actions and possessions and \nbrahmacharya \n&gt; may become=\r\n easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya \nfirst and \n&gt; detach=\r\nment may become easy as a result and come later. Various \nsigns of \n&gt; spiri=\r\ntual progress come almost together, but the exact order can \nchange from \n&gt;=\r\n person to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability \nto get \n=\r\n&gt; something. It may be possible to work it out from another angle!\n&gt; \n&gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpan=\r\na\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Namaste si=\r\nr\n&gt; \n&gt; i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question on a\n=\r\n&gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.\n&gt; If you have time ,if you=\r\n could please reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking this for many days\n&gt; that as menti=\r\noned in recent thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt; it was important to maintain braha=\r\nmcharya but i wanted to ask that\n&gt; even vimalananda had to work for 6 years=\r\n for overcoming lust though\n&gt; he had his deity with him from the very early=\r\n in life.\n&gt; \n&gt; how can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even h=\r\nave a\n&gt; deity obtain this goal.\n&gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamc=\r\nharya for few months but\n&gt; after that i am not able to hold it ,\n&gt; and even=\r\n if i maintain some physical chastity it refuses to go out\n&gt; of mind\n&gt; \n&gt; M=\r\noreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; suppress de=\r\nsires but remove them from the root\n&gt; \n&gt; So, how can i finish it completely=\r\n from my mind\n&gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of \nB=\r\nrahamcharya\n&gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in maint=\r\naing\n&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; \n&gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n&gt; \n&gt; The o=\r\nnly reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; vimalananda too=\r\nk such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt; not in 6 years at leas=\r\nt in 10-12 years\n&gt; \n&gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you c=\r\nan remove my\n&gt; identity from this that would be appreciable\n&gt; \n&gt; if what i =\r\nworte offended you please delete this mail\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
