However I am very wary of awakening kundali=\r\nni deliberately myself. I have heard of people going crazy from doing it wi=\r\nthout the proper devotion and surrender to the Divine. I am scared of the i=\r\ndea of siddhis/kundalini etc etc....I don&#39;t trust myself to handle this sor=\r\nt of thing at all. I don&#39;t have the wisdom to handle kundalini shakti/siddh=\r\nis etc. \n\nI see siddhis as the evil Ring in the Lord of the Rings....a powe=\r\nr than can really be misused. I know that siddhis are not inherently evil, =\r\nbut are actually Divine...but they can cause a great fall if acquired witho=\r\nut the prerequite devotion, as one can really fatten one&#39;s ego with them. T=\r\nhey are a dangerous temptation in my view. \n\nI prefer to see myself as a si=\r\nlly child of the Divine, doing Japa etc to the amusement of the Divine pare=\r\nnts. What a silly child, they must be thinking. I like this idea. \n\nI prefe=\r\nr to do Japa, and let God decide if She and He wants to awaken my kundalini=\r\n. Durga Herself IS the kundalini, I dare not wake her up without her explic=\r\nit permission (else all hell will probably break loose!) So I&#39;m content wit=\r\nh doing Japa for now (this contentment is thanks to Her), and with letting =\r\nHer wake up in her own sweet time. :)\n\nGaurav ji, I don&#39;t yet have the devo=\r\ntion to see God by saying the mantra just once. So gotta do it many many ma=\r\nny times (yep with maths involved)!\n\nSrinivas ji, I can&#39;t do the mantra tha=\r\nt quickly! I&#39;m a slow chanter- it helps create a bit of feeling. Otherwise =\r\nlike Sivananda says, I feel like a contractor doing his job in a hurry. \n\nS=\r\naranyan ji, nice quote from Ramakrishna. I agree with your point...with har=\r\nd work and sincerity (and some Grace), no doubt devotion will eventually ar=\r\nise. \n\nRakesh ji, thank for the message...I will look up the story in the B=\r\nhagavatam that you mention.\n\nHiramalini ji, cool story about the boy and Gu=\r\nru showing the importance of faith. Thanks.\n\nWell, I&#39;ll keep up the mantra =\r\npractice....sometimes with feeling, sometimes mechanically, and trust that =\r\nall will work out for the best.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;shankar789&quot; &lt;shankar789@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Aparna,\n&gt; \n&gt; If y=\r\nou desire to see Divine thru physical senses, Kundalini awakening is the be=\r\nst way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I had undergone Kundalini awakening program (called B=\r\nhava Spandana) organized by Isha Yoga. Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev conducted the=\r\n program and it was very powerful. During the course of Maha Deva meditatio=\r\nn, one could see the Divine figures in his/ her ajna chakra. It was amazing=\r\n experience. After Kundalini awakening, I am not the old I :). \n&gt; \n&gt; If you=\r\n have difficulty for self-realization or Enlightenment in other paths, then=\r\n Yoga is the way for your Enlightenment. This is the first sentence of the =\r\nYoga Sutras written by Patanjali. This has proved to be absolutely correct =\r\nin my case. \n&gt; \n&gt; Good Luck\n&gt; \n&gt; Shankar\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This business of r=\r\nepeating God Name, that Nobody ji mentioned...it ain&#39;t no joke ...doing it =\r\nI mean! I tried today, and boy, it was hard...failed mostly, to be honest.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda, Cha=\r\nitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obsessed with this =\r\nName business. That means, there must be something to it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I really=\r\n want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed with the Name. I f=\r\nirmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, and the Name helpe=\r\nd me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long story, but basically,=\r\n I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like I was dying...an=\r\nd it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Name &quot;Keshava please=\r\n help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesus out of me, and =\r\neach time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only th=\r\ning that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon my=\r\n language), the Name alone is reliable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m trying to say, is=\r\n I want to devise some practical ways to get serious about this sadhana. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especial=\r\nly of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables i=\r\nn the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh r=\r\nepetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would res=\r\nult in Darshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! =\r\nReally wanted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at th=\r\ne rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take =\r\nme till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But hey, I decided to make a st=\r\nart anyway, and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya ma=\r\nntra, in January this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with my m=\r\nind wandering most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of rounds with=\r\n proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to say the mantr=\r\na loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradually im=\r\nproving but very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take=\r\n me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 mo=\r\nnth break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purascharana. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, two things help me get my 11 rounds of japa done every day w=\r\nhen I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mention it, if anybody&#39;s interested, =\r\njust in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobil=\r\ne to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the phone. While doing this, I stick my han=\r\nd in my pocket and count the japa on my fingers. I get a couple of rounds d=\r\none during my working day this way (I check carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s=\r\n listening). Also while stuck in traffic (while the car is NOT moving), I p=\r\nut my hands-free ear pieces on, and pretend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the=\r\n phone and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The other thing that I find use=\r\nful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape=\r\n to do a round or two of japa at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes an=\r\nd lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the m=\r\nantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case an=\r\nybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a day. This allows me to comple=\r\nte my 11 rounds a day, on days when my working hours are long. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nknow this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention this for anyone else wh=\r\nose work life interferes with their japa. At least, it provides a solution =\r\nto doing a bit of japa at work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anybody else has any thoughts/s=\r\nuggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBest wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
