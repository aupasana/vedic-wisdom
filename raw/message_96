Of course I do realise that it is not for people like me to =\r\n\njudge whether a person is spiritually advanced, for one has oneself \nto be=\r\n at an advanced level to truly recognise another at a similar \nlevel. Yet, =\r\nthese days one comes across people who claim to \nbe &#39;spiritually advanced&#39;,=\r\n to be able to go into &#39;samadhi&#39; etc. The \ntraditional picture, as I unders=\r\ntand it, of an advanced soul is very \ndifferent from what these people seem=\r\n to be. Traditionally, a \nspiritually advanced person is supposed to be dva=\r\nndvatita, non-\nmaterialistic and so on. But then how does one recognise the=\r\nse \nqualities with certainty? Are there any basic outer signs one looks \nfo=\r\nr? Or is it that one just &#39;knows&#39;?\n\nA related question - is it true that pe=\r\nople who are born with \nphysical and mental disorders are actually advanced=\r\n souls \nwho &#39;choose&#39; this difficult path? Is it possible to &#39;choose&#39; your \n=\r\npath? I always thought that good begat good, and bad bad, and that \nthat wa=\r\ns the only way one could &#39;choose&#39; a path. \n\nThank you\n\nRohini\n\n\n"}}
