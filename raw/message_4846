I am=\r\n afraid it is a coded prayer. It contains hints in coded form for several s=\r\npecific sadhanas to get specific results using Devi Saptashati.\n&gt;  \n&gt; From =\r\nthat point of view, one can understand why it says there is no siddhi witho=\r\nut Kunjika stotra. However, one will almost certainly not get siddhi by mer=\r\nely chanting Kunjika stotra or adding it to one&#39;s Saptashati chanting. In f=\r\nact, siddhi often comes to those who do not consciously pursue it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one says &quot;just spending time with your mother an=\r\nd expressing your love and respect for her will not give you her wealth. Yo=\r\nu need her checkbook to access her wealth&quot;, that is not incorrect. But that=\r\n is not the complete story. Just by having the checkbook of one&#39;s mother, o=\r\nne may not be able to get her wealth. Check needs her signature. On the oth=\r\ner hand, a simple child who does not consciously or explicitly try to get t=\r\nhe wealth of one&#39;s mother and only spends time with mother expressing love =\r\nand respect from her may end up getting her wealth when she decides by hers=\r\nelf to give.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, I suggest not being a son who looks to get moth=\r\ner&#39;s wealth by laying hands on her checkbook. Just cultivate love for mothe=\r\nr and devote yourself to her. A mother knows what to give and when.\n&gt;  \n&gt; J=\r\nust chanting saptashati is quite useful.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Fr=\r\nee &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;    =\r\n                 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- shashi_nambisan &lt;shashin@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Hi All,\n&gt; &gt;   I can see that there were some discussion on kunjika stotram=\r\n before\n&gt; &gt; however can someone who has expertise in sanskrit give exact me=\r\naning \n&gt; &gt; of these snippets\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These are snippets from two slokas in=\r\n Siddha Kunjika Stotram.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.
