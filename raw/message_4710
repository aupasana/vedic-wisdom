Anyone who \nclaims to be Ramakris=\r\nhna or Ma Sarada, MUST BE associated and surrounded by a \nbunch of ATLEAST =\r\n15/20 very high caliber sadhakas.=C2=A0 These very high caliber \nsadhakas=\r\n=C2=A0who will surround a reborn Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada will each be like=\r\n \nspiritual stalwarts in their own rights, like each of Ramakrishna and Ma =\r\n\nSarada&#39;s disciples were (Swami Brahmananda, Swami Premananda, Swami Sivana=\r\nnda \netc etc) when they had=C2=A0incarnated. \n\n=C2=A0\nSo unless this condit=\r\nion is met, (which Ramakrishna himself had specified in his \nlast birth), m=\r\nost of the Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada reincarnation-claimants have \nto be dis=\r\n-qualified. \n\n=C2=A0\nSome people have an impression that if and when Ramakr=\r\nishna and Ma Sarada and \nSwamiji reincarnate, they would have an associatio=\r\nn with the Ramakrishna \nMission. This is, in my opinion, an incorrect assum=\r\nption. When Lord Krishna was \nborn, he did not spend his time trying to fin=\r\nd out where is Ayodhya since he \nwas=C2=A0also=C2=A0Lord Rama is his=C2=A0p=\r\nast life. Similarly,=C2=A0these souls (Ramakrishna and \nMa=C2=A0Sarada and =\r\ntheir disciples)=C2=A0are of such high caliber that they do come back \nwhen=\r\n it is designed and needed for them to come back and perform some strong \no=\r\nbjectives and set in motion a spiritual impulse in this land based on the \n=\r\nnecessities of the specific desh-kaal-patra. Therefore what they do will be=\r\n \nbased purely on the zeitgeist - spirit of the times - when they incarnate=\r\n.=C2=A0 For \nall one knows, Ramakrishna may not incarnate as a simple rusti=\r\nc villager any \nmore, but rather=C2=A0as a well-educated,=C2=A0city-bred in=\r\ndividual with the practical \nintelligence of ten Chanakyas who might end up=\r\n changing the political and \nspiritual future of this land for centuries to=\r\n come, which is what the necessity \nof the present=C2=A0times really are. \n=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nWe already have an overdose of Swamis and Babas and Mas and Bhagwan=\r\ns and their \nashrams and their teeming millions as followers. What we need =\r\nis someone who=C2=A0may \nor may not have an ashram, who may or may not pose=\r\n as a Guru in the traditional \nsense, who may or may not be a glib talker (=\r\nas so many of the Babas and Mas are \nthese days), but who has the necessary=\r\n might and power to affect or initiate \nchanges in this land which would be=\r\n of an irrevocable nature.=C2=A0 It is time for a \n1000 years of history to=\r\n change. And only a soul of Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada&#39;s \ncaliber can do it. =\r\nAnyone lesser, would only fizz out=C2=A0with time.\n=C2=A0\nNot that=C2=A0the=\r\ny (Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C2=A0Swamiji) will find the work to be \neasy=\r\n at all. For startes, the dunces would be in confederacy against them. When=\r\n \nVivekanada, before he became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was bitte=\r\nrly \nopposed by the &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city on various issues. Then=\r\n a young \nnot-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and decided he will leave Ka=\r\nsi and never \nreturn to that city untill he &quot;falls on society like a thunde=\r\nrbolt&quot;. Well, that \nis precisely what he did. He fell on Indian society lik=\r\ne a thunderbolt, after \nwhich those very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, aski=\r\nng him to come and grace \ntheir city! \n\n=C2=A0\nSo let us keep our fingers c=\r\nrossed and not=C2=A0focus on emtpy speculations, rather \nwait for the most =\r\ninteresting coming=C2=A0decade to unfold in all its=C2=A0sound and fury.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste Ranjan,\n\n&gt; After you=\r\n die, what would be your name and religion and nationality\n\nName can change=\r\n on rebirth. Though religion usually stays the same, it CAN \nchange. Nation=\r\nality can of course change too. Job, skills, external nature, \nlooks, gende=\r\nr, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can all change \nfrom bi=\r\nrth to birth.\n\nBasically, the seed of one&#39;s new birth is formed at the time=\r\n of one&#39;s death. As \none&#39;s connection is severed with the body, the last de=\r\nsires/thoughts/ponderings \nof the mind become the seed for the next life. N=\r\nature chooses for one a future \ncourse that allows one to pursue those desi=\r\nres, as much as allowed by one&#39;s \nprevious karmas and debts.\n\nIf one is abl=\r\ne to not entertain ANY desire as one element after another \nevaporates in o=\r\nne&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All the spiritual sadhana \nwe do is =\r\na dress rehearsal.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; when we see you again and do you know how we\n&gt;=\r\n shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n\nIf I and you like each other an=\r\nd your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, \nthey will start off taking =\r\na liking to each other. If I and you dislike each \nother and your rebirth a=\r\nnd my rebirth meet each other, they will start off \ndisliking each other. T=\r\nhis will happen without either being consciously aware of \nwho one was and =\r\nwho the other person was, in the last life.\n\nInstead, if your question is h=\r\now we can recognize that so and so person is a \nrebirth of Swami Vivekanand=\r\na, so and so person is a rebirth of Paramahamsa \nYogananda etc, the answer =\r\nis complex.\n\nThe reborn person may not look like the old person or do simil=\r\nar work or have \nmuch *external* similarity. So it is difficult to &quot;recogni=\r\nze&quot; one. After all, \nRama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle), w=\r\nhile Krishna had thousands \nof wives. Rama was a great warrior and killed R=\r\navana in the biggest war of his \ntimes. Krishna was a key player in the big=\r\ngest war of his time, but did not take \na weapon at all. The game can be di=\r\nffent in each coming..\n\n* * *\n\nWhen it comes to recognizing the rebirth of =\r\na great soul, it can become a trap.\n\nRamakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mat=\r\na that he would be back after 100 years \nand that everybody else who came w=\r\nith him would have to come back with him. When \nSarada Mata and Lakshmi Dev=\r\ni protested, he said they did not have a choice! Even \nSwami Vivekananda sa=\r\nid once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once more. The Master \nsaid I am to co=\r\nme back once more with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you have to come \nback becaus=\r\ne Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied, &quot;souls like that have great \npower=\r\n, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ramakrishna said that people would get \nlibe=\r\nrated en masse during his next coming and that would be the last opportunit=\r\ny \nfor a long time to come.\n\nInterestingly, two good saints claimed to be r=\r\ne-incarnations of Ramakrishna \nsince then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps=\r\n both!). Another good saint \nsuggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sa=\r\nrada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said \nthat he identified a particular young man a=\r\ns the reincarnation of Swami \nVivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sa=\r\nrada Mata and more than twenty \ndisciples of a very high caliber and differ=\r\nent aptitudes. Together, they nearly \nmoulded the direction of spiritual In=\r\ndia for the next century. None of the \nclaimants of rebirthhood are surroun=\r\nded by people of such caliber or fit the \nbill.\n\nThus, there can be false c=\r\nlaimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It is not \nthat they are lying=\r\n. They may simply be deluding themselves and of course ego is \nthe root of =\r\ndelusion!\n\nIn fact, is it necessary to recognize whether X is a rebirth of =\r\nY, given that X \nand Y are different and play a different game? A small dis=\r\ncussion on this point \nvis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be f=\r\nound in:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n\n* * *\n\nTh=\r\nough external factors like nationality, religion, name, job, looks, gender =\r\netc \ncan change, some internal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who o=\r\nne likes, \nwho one dislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, et=\r\nc, may remain \nessentially the same.\n\nFor example, suppose rajput king Prit=\r\nhviraj was reborn as Muslim emperor Akbar \n(as said by Vimalananda). One wa=\r\ns a Hindu and the other was a Muslim. However, \nboth were very brave, unafr=\r\naid of death, inherently spiritual, had a refined \ntaste in fine arts and h=\r\nad deep conviction. The previous connections with \nrajputs resulted in Akba=\r\nr being born and raised when his mother was hiding at a \nrajput household, =\r\nbefore moving to Delhi. Despite being a Muslim, he actually \nhelped the Hin=\r\ndu causes (to the extent possible at that time) by putting an end \nto barba=\r\nric practices like killing defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in \nc=\r\nonquered places. He promoted acceptance of other faiths, canceled pilgrimag=\r\ne \ntaxes on Hindus and even came up with his own religion of humanity towar=\r\nds the \nend of his life by integrating various religions. In one life, he t=\r\nried to save \nIndia from invading barbarians. In another, he was born as a =\r\ncultured man amid \nbarbarians and tried to save India by changing the ways =\r\nof his own people.

As one&#39;s connection is severed with the body, the last =\r\ndesires/thoughts/ponderings of the mind become the seed for the next life. =\r\nNature chooses for one a future course that allows one to pursue those desi=\r\nres, as much as allowed by one&#39;s previous karmas and debts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one i=\r\ns able to not entertain ANY desire as one element after another evaporates =\r\nin one&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All the spiritual sadhana we do =\r\nis a dress rehearsal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; when we see you again and do=\r\n you know how\n we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nIf I and you like each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each othe=\r\nr, they will start off taking a liking to each other. If I and you dislike =\r\neach other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they will start=\r\n off disliking each other. This will happen without either being consciousl=\r\ny aware of who one was and who the other person was, in the last life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Instead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and so person =\r\nis a rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so person is a rebirth of Paramah=\r\namsa Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The reborn person may not=\r\n look like the old person or do similar work or have much *external* simila=\r\nrity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; one. After all, Rama advocated eka =\r\npatni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna had thousands of wives. Ram=\r\na was a great warrior and killed Ravana in the biggest war of his times. Kr=\r\nishna\n was a key player in the biggest war of his time, but did not take a =\r\nweapon at all. The game can be diffent in each coming..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul, it can become a =\r\ntrap.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back =\r\nafter 100 years and that everybody else who came with him would have to com=\r\ne back with him. When Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they =\r\ndid not have a choice! Even Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to =\r\ncome back once more. The Master said I am to come back once more with him&quot;.=\r\n When questioned &quot;you have to come back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, =\r\nhe replied, &quot;souls like that have great power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion,=\r\n Ramakrishna said that people would get liberated en masse during his next =\r\ncoming and that would be the last opportunity for a long time to come.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Interestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of\n Ramakri=\r\nshna since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good sain=\r\nt suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba s=\r\naid that he identified a particular young man as the reincarnation of Swami=\r\n Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twent=\r\ny disciples of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they =\r\nnearly moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next century. None =\r\nof the claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or=\r\n fit the bill.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood=\r\n of a great soul! It is not that they are lying. They may simply be deludin=\r\ng themselves and of course ego is the root of delusion!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact, is =\r\nit necessary to recognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X and Y a=\r\nre different and play a different game? A small discussion on this point vi=\r\ns-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be found\n in:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though external factors like nationality, religion, nam=\r\ne, job, looks, gender etc can change, some internal factors may remain the =\r\nsame. Moreover, who one likes, who one dislikes, what values one is attract=\r\ned to internally, etc, may remain essentially the same.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For example,=\r\n suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim emperor Akbar (as said=\r\n by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and the other was a Muslim. However, both=\r\n were very brave, unafraid of death, inherently spiritual, had a refined ta=\r\nste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous connections with raj=\r\nputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised when his mother was hiding at =\r\na rajput household, before moving to Delhi. Despite being a Muslim, he actu=\r\nally helped the Hindu causes (to the extent possible at\n that time) by putt=\r\ning an end to barbaric practices like killing defeated Hindu kings and all =\r\nHindu priests in conquered places. He promoted acceptance of other faiths, =\r\ncanceled pilgrimage taxes on Hindus and even came up with his own religion =\r\nof humanity towards the end of his life by integrating various religions. I=\r\nn one life, he tried to save India from invading barbarians. In another, he=\r\n was born as a cultured man amid barbarians and tried to save India by chan=\r\nging the ways of his own people. There is a subtle continuity in the agenda=\r\n at a deeper level!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;
