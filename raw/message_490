Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; You misunderstood me. The appearance was not &quot;before =\r\nme&quot;. It was \nbefore my guru Dr Manish Pandit. The only other person present=\r\n on \nthe temple premises at that time was the gentleman I mentioned, who \nl=\r\nost his job after starting Kaali mantra and went to India for \npilgrimage. =\r\nI was not there then. Though I was chanting with Manish \non other days, I w=\r\nas sent away on that specific day to visit Kanchi \nand Tirunavannamalai (Ra=\r\nmana Maharshi&#39;s place).\n&gt;  \n&gt; I understand it was Mahaakaali who gave a dar=\r\nshan and asked Manish \nto spread homam as a spiritual sadhana in the world.=\r\n She told him \nthat she would arrange all the resources needed and asked hi=\r\nm to \njust start. She also apparently told him of a sequence of events \ntha=\r\nt were to happen.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Interestingly, the head priest of that temple had s=\r\nome books on \nhomam gifted to Manish and me on the very next day. Neither M=\r\nanish \nnor I asked him for such books. We never expressed interest in doing=\r\n \nhomam or learning homam. He himself got the inspiration. There was a \nboo=\r\nk on different styles of homam for Ganesha and another book (by \nRamakrishn=\r\na Mutt, Chennai!) on the procedures for various types of \nhomam. Manish and=\r\n I were gifted one copy each. I perused those books \nto devise the short me=\r\nthod described in the manuals.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Interestingl=\r\ny, how we met that priest and how this shata Chandi \nhomam was arranged is =\r\nbased on interesting coincidences. The son of \nthe guru of a local priest w=\r\nas visiting greater Boston temporarily. \nHe was a famous sivacharya (a spec=\r\nial group of priests) from Chennai \nand the head priest of Kaalikambal temp=\r\nle in Chennai. We merely went \nto take his blessings on a Thursday night. W=\r\ne chatted a little with \nhim and then my wife asked him &quot;what are you doing=\r\n on this \nSaturday&quot;. He immediately said with affection &quot;we are doing on \nS=\r\naturday whatever Mrs Padmaja (my wife&#39;s name) tells us to do&quot;. \nPlease note=\r\n that we met for the first time in this life and did not \nknow each other a=\r\nt all. My wife said &quot;well, we perform a Satya \nNarayana vratam on every Pou=\r\nrnima night. You are most welcome to \nattend.&quot; He said &quot;we are coming&quot;. The=\r\nn he called up a few guys in \nCanada and told them to cancel some events in=\r\n Canada. We learnt \nlater that he was supposed to spend that weekend in Can=\r\nada. Instead, \nhe decided to stay back and come to our house.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He came=\r\n to our house on Saturday evening (Pournima) with two other \nsenior priests=\r\n. They stayed till the end of Satya Narayana vratam \n(almost midnight) and =\r\nenjoyed it. As soon as he entered our house, \nhe declared &quot;I must do a Chan=\r\ndi homam at your house. The mother \nwants me to do a homam here. But I have=\r\n one condition. I and other \npriests who come with me will not take even a =\r\ncent. You buy the \nmaterials needed, but give no money.&quot; Even though we wer=\r\ne not \nexcited about the condition, we said ok.\n&gt;  \n&gt; During the navaratris=\r\n of 2005, a few days after a solar eclipse on \nmy lagna (when Sun, Moon, Me=\r\nrcury and Ketu were in Kanya - my lagna \nand 8th house from Moon), he came =\r\nwith 3 other priests and did a \nChandi homam in really grand style. It was =\r\nan amazing experience. It \nwas actually the first time in my life that I he=\r\nard Chandipath. I \nhad never heard it before. Interestingly, I had my own b=\r\niases. In \nthe morning, I actually prayed to Mahalakshmi (my ishta devata),=\r\n &quot;O \nMother, these priests want to do Chandi homam at my house and I \nconse=\r\nnted. I don&#39;t know who Chandi is. Whichever deity they call, I \nwill be thi=\r\nnking of you only. You please come and bless us.&quot; It was \npartly innocent a=\r\nnd partly foolish.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This was my first exposure to Chandipath and the f=\r\nirst Chandi \nhomam at my house. To think that I have now done more than 320=\r\n \nChandi homas at my house..\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manish was con=\r\ncerned about the continued troubles faced by the \nSankaracharya of Kanchi (=\r\nthe state government filed some cases \nagainst him) and he decided that we =\r\nhad to perform a Shata Chandi \nhomam for his relief. He was not sure when a=\r\nnd where it should \nhappen.\n&gt;  \n&gt; After the Chandi homam at our house, we b=\r\necame close to that \npriest and kept meeting him regularly (until he left B=\r\noston). When I \nmentioned Manish&#39;s wish to him, he said &quot;Sir, we will do th=\r\ne Shata \nChandi homam he wanted at our temple. I will arrange everything. Y=\r\nou \nand Manish Pandit just come and sit for the event. We will take the \nsa=\r\nnkalpa you want. I will do everything.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Finally, the shata Chandi hom=\r\nam was conducted March 1-7, 2006. \nInterestingly, on the 64th day from the =\r\npoornahuti of that homam, \nthe ruling government of that state was defeated=\r\n in elections and a \nnew government came.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manish put it this way late=\r\nr &quot;Narasimha, who are we to help a \ngreat saint like Sankaracharya? We are =\r\nnot capable of helping him. \nWe are really of no use. The idea was not that=\r\n we would help him. \nThe idea is that we would help *ourselves* because of =\r\nthe positive \nintention to help Sanakaracharya! It is all Her play. See, th=\r\ne \nMother gave the thought of helping him and brought us to Chennai. \nThen =\r\nshe appeared and instructed to spread homam. Now so many people \nare doing =\r\nhomam and benefiting. In future, many many more will do. \nAll this is happe=\r\nning because of a positive intention to help \nSanakaracharya.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though=\r\n the dates for shata Chandi homam were picked almost \narbitrarily, there wa=\r\ns one interesting coincidence. The day on which \nthe ritual was started (20=\r\n06 March 1) was actually the lunar \nbirthday (tithi pravesha) of Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa. In fact, the \ntime when we took sankalpam formally and kicke=\r\nd off the 7-day-long \nritual (in the morning of March 1) was interestingly =\r\nwithin a couple \nof minutes from the *exact* Tithi Pravesha time (time at w=\r\nhich the \nsame fraction of same tithi is left as at birth) of Ramakrishna \n=\r\nParamahamsa. This was not planned and was a mere coincidence. In \nfact, I n=\r\noticed it after the fact!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some forces beyond the scope of the thinkin=\r\ng of my mind are behind \nthe homam movement that is slowly picking up. I am=\r\n fortunate to be \npicked as an instrument in this spiritual movement.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Actually, I do not honestly consider the goddess=\r\n and Sarada Mata \n(and, for that matter, my guru) to be really different. B=\r\nut that is \na different thing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.h=\r\nome.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Ashwin Rawal \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, October 02, 2008 7:44 AM\n&gt;   Subject: =\r\nRe: [vedic-wisdom] Right deity and sadhana (Re: \nYogananda)\n&gt; \n&gt;         De=\r\nar Narsimhaji, You mentioned the appearance of mother \nbefore you.

If \nyou do not know the \n&gt;           right dei=\r\nty, just doing some sadhana is definitely \nbetter than waiting. Pick \n&gt;    =\r\n       whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt;           P=\r\nlease remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is \ndifferent from \n&gt;   =\r\n        sadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which \ndeity you =\r\nworship, \n&gt;           sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes \n=\r\nwaste. However, \n&gt;           sometimes it may be necessary to experience th=\r\ne results \nof some bad karmas \n&gt;           before some good things happen. =\r\nImagine all your karmas \nlying in a pile in a \n&gt;           basket. Suppose =\r\nsome of the really good karmas that will \nenable you to do \n&gt;           ser=\r\nious sadhana and experience great things lie at the \nbottom or middle of \n&gt;=\r\n           the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to \ngive y=\r\nou the fruits \n&gt;           of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching=\r\n into \nthe pile and \n&gt;           retrieving those karmas. In the process, s=\r\nome other \nkarmas may spill over \n&gt;           and give their fruits. Some o=\r\nf those may be undesirable. \nSo what? They had \n&gt;           to be experienc=\r\ned sometime or the other, anyway!\n&gt; \n&gt;           A serious sadhaka should n=\r\never be disheartened by a few \nseemingly \n&gt;           undesirable results a=\r\nfter starting a spiritual sadhana. \nJust keep going.\n&gt; \n&gt;           One gen=\r\ntleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a \nvery good \n&gt;           prie=\r\nst-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra \nfor a few days, he was \n=\r\n&gt;           laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He \ncontinued =\r\nhis sadhana \n&gt;           and used the break to go on an extended trip to In=\r\ndia \nand make a pilgrimage \n&gt;           to some nice places. He participate=\r\nd in the Shata Chandi \nhomam we conducted \n&gt;           at the Kaalikambal t=\r\nemple in Chennai in March 2006. He \nmet my guru and got \n&gt;           the op=\r\nportunity to be his room mate for a week when we \nstayed at the house \n&gt;   =\r\n        of a priest during the homam. He could observe and \ninteract with m=\r\ny guru \n&gt;           very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a \nvis=\r\nion of the Mother on \n&gt;           2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told=\r\n him to start \nthe work on spreading \n&gt;           homam in the world, this =\r\ngentleman was present there. \nThough he could not \n&gt;           see the Moth=\r\ner, he actually smelled something out of the \nworld and was \n&gt;           ba=\r\nffled. He knew something was going on, but did not \nknow what. The temple \n=\r\n&gt;           was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen \nwere the=\r\n only people \n&gt;           on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even th=\r\nough he \ncould not see the \n&gt;           Mother, it was most fortunate of hi=\r\nm to be present there \nat *that* crucial \n&gt;           moment. That is enoug=\r\nh to mould the rest of his life.\n&gt; \n&gt;           You never know how, when an=\r\nd where the grace of god \nfalls on you. \n&gt;           Calculations and logic=\r\n are useless when it comes to the \ngrace of god. Just \n&gt;           surrende=\r\nr and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If \nit needs \n&gt;           fin=\r\ne-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any \nbad things that \n&gt;   =\r\n        happen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed \nas nature s=\r\nettling \n&gt;           some debts so that you are prepared to receive the \nfr=\r\nuits of some really \n&gt;           auspicious karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt;           As Shird=\r\ni Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and \nsaburi&quot;.

In the\n&gt;           &gt; dream,\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; there was a big ritual f=\r\nire. My guru Manish Pandit \nand I were\n&gt;           &gt; sitting in\n&gt;          =\r\n &gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama \ntechniques in\n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt; the\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody els=\r\ne that I \ncould not\n&gt;           &gt; recognize.\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; It was not anyb=\r\nody I had seen before.\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream=\r\n to my guru after a couple of \nweeks. First\n&gt;           &gt; he said he\n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was and said he \nwould&#39;ve\n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; probably known if\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon aft=\r\ner it had happened. \nI left it\n&gt;           &gt; there.\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; However,=\r\n when we talked in the next weekend, he \nreferred to my\n&gt;           &gt; dream=\r\n and\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and \n=\r\nasked me to\n&gt;           &gt; search on\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; the internet for his pho=\r\nto and see if he was the \nperson I saw in\n&gt;           &gt; my dream.\n&gt;        =\r\n   &gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa \nYogananda (before\n&gt;   =\r\n        &gt; him). Though\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was no=\r\nt knowledegable \nabout this\n&gt;           &gt; lineage and\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; did no=\r\nt see his picture before. I searched on the \ninternet and\n&gt;           &gt; fou=\r\nnd a\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the \n=\r\nperson I saw\n&gt;           &gt; in my\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; dream. The person that Mani=\r\nsh transformed into in my \ndream looked\n&gt;           &gt; like a\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;=\r\n slightly younger version of that photo.\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; When=\r\n I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and\n&gt;           &gt; said, &quot;Narasi=\r\nmha, there\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. Leave=\r\n it \nfor now.&quot;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much =\r\nabout kriya yoga or \nabout the\n&gt;           &gt; lineage of\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Para=\r\nmahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life \nstarts from\n&gt;           &gt; Datt=\r\natreya. We\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramaha=\r\nmsa \nand his\n&gt;           &gt; lineage and got\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; a lot of our know=\r\nledge, inspiration and perhaps \nexperience from\n&gt;           &gt; them. We do\n&gt;=\r\n           &gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of \nParamahamsa Yogan=\r\nanda.\n&gt;           &gt; But,\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Manish thought there were some othe=\r\nr indirect links. \nMoreover, he\n&gt;           &gt; guessed\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; who I =\r\nsaw, even though I myself had no idea who I \nsaw, and he\n&gt;           &gt; gues=\r\nsed\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!\n&gt;           =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle \nconne=\r\nctions\n&gt;           &gt; between\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; several lineages that seem disj=\r\noint today.\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda als=\r\no appeared in the \nprison cell of\n&gt;           &gt; Sri\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Aurobind=\r\no (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda \nand Upanishad)\n&gt;           &gt; a=\r\nnd\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; An interesti=\r\nng coincidence is that a swamiji from \nPuri contacted\n&gt;           &gt; me with=\r\nin a\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru and \nParamaha=\r\nmsa\n&gt;           &gt; Yogananda were\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same gu=\r\nru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). \nHe is the\n&gt;           &gt; keeper of\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; =\r\nsome astrological knowledge that his guru received \nfrom Yukteshwar\n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt; Maharaj.\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed that =\r\nknowledge \nand spent a\n&gt;           &gt; day at my\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; house. Thus, =\r\nsome small connection was made with a \nrepresentative\n&gt;           &gt; of that=\r\n\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik \ndebts=\r\n may\n&gt;           &gt; have been\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; there...\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.=\r\n\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the=\r\n \nimpression that my\n&gt;           &gt; guru has\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; some psychic abi=\r\nlities or siddhis. That may indeed be \ntrue. But he\n&gt;           &gt; always\n&gt; =\r\n          &gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance \nwhatsoever.=\r\n He\n&gt;           &gt; says,\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person an=\r\nd lower than dirt \nand capable\n&gt;           &gt; of\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; nothing.
