Another thing was there that there we=\r\nre no strict fees for the services. Patient was free to pay whatever he can=\r\n afford or is pleased to offer. Sometimes it was money, or grains, or veget=\r\nables or raw drugs-roots-fruits etc whatever the patient can give. And it w=\r\nas ethics on the side of doctor to accept whatever he is being given or eve=\r\nn if he is not paid anything at all.\n\nIn later days, this dis-similar fee s=\r\ntructure did lead to abuse. As we discussed in another mail that with chang=\r\ning times nature tend to change the infrastructure and operating methods. S=\r\no a pattern of similar fees came in to light. Obviously, this is also being=\r\n abused now a days. \n\nIt is surely immoral and a bad karma to charge money =\r\nmuch more than appropriate.\n\nBut it is surely a concern that how to decide =\r\nthe &#39;cost of medicine&#39;\n\nIn Pvt practice, with time, number of families bein=\r\ng fed from the practice increases upto 20 to 30 on average. \nWith increasin=\r\ng complexities in medicine it is necessary to pump money in the system regu=\r\nlarly to accommodate new researches, updates, latest facilities etc.\n\nIs th=\r\ne answer to this is to do a detached karma? and to work without a  sense of=\r\n &#39;doer ship&#39;?\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am forwarding comments=\r\n from Manish.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for shor=\r\nt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Manish Pandit &lt;mm.pan=\r\ndit@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Regarding a doctors karma and dharma:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ideally=\r\n, the doctor should not charge for treatment at all. This is my\n&gt; &gt; persona=\r\nl viewpoint based on my experience.\n&gt; &gt; Why?\n&gt; &gt; In my view, it is God who =\r\ncures the patient. But if you charge the patient\n&gt; &gt; money, then the karma =\r\ninvolved according to me is akin to taking on the\n&gt; &gt; patient&#39;s suffering o=\r\nn yourself in the future. In that case, better you just\n&gt; &gt; take on his kar=\r\nma through some spiritual means if you are capable of that.\n&gt; &gt; Why add mon=\r\ney to the equation.\n&gt; &gt; Medicine was never just a profession, you must have=\r\n an empathy for the\n&gt; &gt; living being, you must desire that his suffering mu=\r\nst end.\n&gt; &gt; That is one of the reasons I left India for the NHS.\n&gt; &gt; I get =\r\npaid by a hospital for doing a job. I don&#39;t want to be paid by\n&gt; &gt; individu=\r\nal patients. Also, here the money comes to an account, I do not\n&gt; &gt; handle =\r\nit explicitly, so I can and have forgotten about it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If somebody w=\r\nants to donate money to you, as a result and if you keep no fee\n&gt; &gt; but ask=\r\n for payment of what you have spent on the medicine then it is ok,\n&gt; &gt; not =\r\notherwise. People have no clue what the karma is in taking money nay\n&gt; &gt; ev=\r\nen sometimes forcibly taking money from a suffering patient or his family,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; many times when it is frankly prohibitively unaffordable. If they and t=\r\nheir\n&gt; &gt; family knew, they would never do the things which are indeed being=\r\n done in\n&gt; &gt; the name of Dhanvantari.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna said hence, &quot;A d=\r\noctor&#39;s money is pus and blood, lawyers money is\n&gt; &gt; blood and tears&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if you had to pay back any of this karma. Like eating chillies =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; previous day and asking for icecream to come the next day at defeca=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; Manish\n\n\n"}}
