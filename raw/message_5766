A man in the audience said, &quot;If ministers stop preaching hell-fire, the=\r\ny\nwill have no control over their people.&quot;\n\nA. They had better lose it then=\r\n. The man who is frightened into religion has\nno religion at all. Better te=\r\nach him of his divine nature than of his\nanimal.\n\nQ. What did the Lord mean=\r\n when he said, &quot;The kingdom of heaven is not of\nthis world?&quot;\n\nA. That the k=\r\ningdom of heaven is within us. The Jewish idea was a kingdom of\nheaven upon=\r\n this earth. That was not the idea of Jesus.\n\nQ. Do you believe we come up =\r\nfrom the animals?\n\nA. I believe that, by the law of evolution, the higher b=\r\neings have come up\nfrom the lower kingdoms.\n\nQ. Do you know of anyone who r=\r\nemembers his previous life ?\n\nA. I have met some who told me they did remem=\r\nber their previous life. They\nhad reached a point where they could remember=\r\n their former incarnations.\n\nQ. Do you believe in Christ&#39;s crucifixion?\n\nA.=\r\n Christ was God incarnate; they could not kill him. That which was\ncrucifie=\r\nd was only a semblance, a mirage.\n\nQ. If he could have produced such a semb=\r\nlance as that, would not that have\nbeen the greatest miracle of all?\n\nA. I =\r\nlook upon miracles as the greatest stumbling-blocks in the way of\ntruth. Wh=\r\nen the disciples of Buddha told him of a man who had performed a\nso-called =\r\nmiracle =E2=80=94 had taken a bowl from a great height without touching it\n=\r\n=E2=80=94 and showed him the bowl, he took it and crushed it under his feet=\r\n and told\nthem never to build their faith on miracles, but to look for trut=\r\nh in\neverlasting principles. He taught them the true inner light =E2=80=94 =\r\nthe light of\nthe spirit, which is the only safe light to go by. Miracles ar=\r\ne only\nstumbling-blocks. Let us brush them aside.\n\nQ. Do you believe Jesus =\r\npreached the Sermon on the Mount?\n\nA. I do believe he did. But in this matt=\r\ner I have to go by the books as\nothers do, and I am aware that mere book te=\r\nstimony is rather shaky ground.\nBut we are all safe in taking the teachings=\r\n of the Sermon on the Mount as a\nguide. We have to take what appeals to our=\r\n inner spirit. Buddha taught five\nhundred years before Christ, and his word=\r\ns were full of blessings: never a\ncurse came from his lips, nor from his li=\r\nfe; never one from Zoroaster, nor\nfrom Confucius.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikiso=\r\nurce.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_1/Lectures_And=\r\n_Discourses/Soul,_God_And_Religion\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=\r\n=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e65da54447ce83049bb10cba\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nQ.
