Shiva and Vishnu ha=\r\nd unconditional love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal =\r\nhuman beings and their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not go=\r\nverned by petty notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Shaivit=\r\ne-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nev=\r\nertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mi=\r\nndedness is ok as long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief=\r\n system.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one =\r\nof the available paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain path=\r\ns lead to the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path one h=\r\nas chosen leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbi=\r\nng the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After =\r\nall, there may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see path=\r\ns on the other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side.=\r\n If one does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s=\r\n own path, that does no harm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narr=\r\nower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to b=\r\ne quite nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all =\r\npaths are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to conv=\r\nerge there. After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths=\r\n to god. Of course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path=\r\n may have some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. O=\r\nne path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it.=\r\n And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using sev=\r\neral paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching =\r\nthe top.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them =\r\ngood luck to reach the top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they w=\r\nant to say about your path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and =\r\nfaith, you just walk your path and reach the top!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe problem is that some people are doing no sadhana really, making no progr=\r\ness really and yet passing judgments on other paths and getting into fights=\r\n. They are like people at the base of the mountain, trying to block people =\r\nfrom some paths and trying to enroll them in their path. They may fight wit=\r\nh people and kill them too. They stay at the base forever and never reach t=\r\nhe top. They are a problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, people with narrow views who do s=\r\nome sadhana and make progress are ok. They are on some path and will eventu=\r\nally reach god. For example, so many Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shi=\r\nva as a lower demigod may be doing their mantra several malas a day with a =\r\ngood level of devotion and they will eventually make progress. I know Vaish=\r\nnavas in some sampradayas who do not even worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Sh=\r\niva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the start of their poojas instead =\r\nof Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try to see all human beings as =\r\nVishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep their austerities. Bottomline is =\r\nthat they are doing some sadhana and will eventually make progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Let us not worry about people who are doing some sadhana and progressing.=\r\n Any deficiencies in their understanding will be addressed in due course.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioni=\r\nng and keep making progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your views =\r\nbut for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his m=\r\nission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri=\r\n Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards S=\r\nhri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mi=\r\nne are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views l=\r\nike me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard=\r\n stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even tha=\r\nt well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for V=\r\naishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead =\r\nof Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced ag=\r\ne to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes o=\r\nr clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender.

But that does not =\r\ntake away anything from them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My personal favorite is Lord Jna=\r\nneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary =\r\noverall.

They need to be simp=\r\nlified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and subscriptio=\r\nn based religions need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and script=\r\nures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to them.

I will reply to them together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing =\r\nrituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for others is an=\r\nother. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced t=\r\no live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cl=\r\neaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not prote=\r\ncted, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results o=\r\nf one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out on=\r\ne fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitt=\r\ner or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deitie=\r\ns throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits =\r\nearlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are =\r\nthrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by th=\r\ne spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadha=\r\nna and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today=\r\n do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing =\r\nwith other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of =\r\ntoday who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana=\r\n father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana on=\r\neself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many =\r\nbrahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of =\r\ncomforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are =\r\nnot really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth r=\r\night now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only =\r\nby brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money=\r\n and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing ritua=\r\nls for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing ritu=\r\nals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in S=\r\nrimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by ove=\r\nrcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrol=\r\nogers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an=\r\n element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing thi=\r\ns&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice =\r\nto someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroa=\r\nds and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an act=\r\nion here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one i=\r\ns bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some su=\r\nfferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s kar=\r\nmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? =\r\nWell, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle des=\r\ncribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brah=\r\nmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas=\r\n. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brah=\r\nmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the kar=\r\nmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Agai=\r\nn, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahma=\r\nnas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you lo=\r\nok at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be t=\r\naught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- =\r\n&quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suff=\r\nering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the=\r\n overall and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas fo=\r\nr Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is t=\r\nhere any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where =\r\nwe can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot=\r\n in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Na=\r\nrasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just=\r\n started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am ver=\r\ny eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numero=\r\nus instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that =\r\nastrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yro=\r\nu family.
