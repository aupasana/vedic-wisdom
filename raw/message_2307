Till now whatever i read about Maharshi, it seemed t=\r\nhat being a self realized person he always remained in an emotionless state=\r\n. I am really happy to be informed about his emotional reactions for the de=\r\nath of Mahatma and gives me a confirmation that Mahatma Gandhi really was a=\r\n Mahatma, whom even self realized Saints looked upon with high esteem.\n\nI a=\r\nlso read something similar incase of Swami Vivekananda. when he was touring=\r\n India in early nineties, he got news of Balaram Basu&#39;s passing away. Immed=\r\niately tears flowed from his eyes. Looking at that some person asked swami =\r\nthat why he is crying over death although he is gnyani and Sanyaasi. Swami =\r\ntold that he is not a dry person. He can also display emotions over death o=\r\nf loved ones. Gnyaan does not make one dry and emotionless.\n\nThank you!\n\nRe=\r\ngards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalasutram =\r\n&lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On the night of January 30th, the news of Mah=\r\natma Gandhi&#39;s death became\n&gt; known everywhere. I heard the news at home onl=\r\ny, because women cannot be in\n&gt; the Ashram in the nights. I went at 7-30 ne=\r\nxt morning. A prayer was being\n&gt; broadcast over the radio. The news of the =\r\ndeath was in the newspapers, and\n&gt; Bhagavan reading it and hearing the pray=\r\ner,said, &quot;This is the prayer of\n&gt; people who prayed like that throughout hi=\r\ns life.&quot; The song &quot;Vaishnava\n&gt; Janato&quot; was broadcast over the radio and Bha=\r\ngavan listened to it sadly. At\n&gt; 9-45, Bhagavan was about to go out when a =\r\nnewspaper reporter came and\n&gt; requested him to give his views on the traged=\r\ny so that they might be\n&gt; published.Bhagavan, his voice choked with emotion=\r\n, said, &quot;For the Mahatma&#39;s\n&gt; death in this tragic manner, every person&#39;s he=\r\nart is mourning. What is there\n&gt; in particular that I could say? Who is the=\r\nre who is not grieved? If I say\n&gt; anything, you will publish it and then, o=\r\nne after another, people will come\n&gt; and ask me. What is the good of it?&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; So saying, Bhagavan sent the reporter away and went for his walk. On hi=\r\ns\n&gt; return, &quot;Vaishnava Janato&quot; was again being broadcast and tears fell fro=\r\nm\n&gt; Bhagavan&#39;s eyes.At 4-30 that afternoon, all the ladies began to sing\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Raghupati Raghava Rajaram&quot;.With tears in his eyes Bhagavan signed to us to=\r\n\n&gt; continue. At 5 o&#39;clock the conch shell blew and in view of the Mahatma&#39;s=\r\n\n&gt; death a special arati (waving of lights) was offered in the Mother&#39;s tem=\r\nple.\n&gt; When the sacred ash and vermilion powder were brought,Bhagavan took =\r\nthem\n&gt; with great reverence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The day before yesterday, while reading t=\r\nhe paper,Bhagavan remarked to\n&gt; someone sitting near him, &quot;Look, didn&#39;t a c=\r\nomet appear some time ago? It is\n&gt; written in this paper that the death of =\r\nthe Mahatma was due to that. So the\n&gt; first result of it is now over.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n What exactly was in Bhagavan&#39;s mind when he said that? Meanwhile, he took =\r\nup\n&gt; another paper and on reading it,said, &quot;The person who fired the shot, =\r\nit\n&gt; seems, came up to the Mahatma and, after bowing down, asked him, `Why =\r\nhave\n&gt; you come so late today, Sir?&#39; The Mahatma replied that it was due to=\r\n some\n&gt; work. The shot was fired immediately after.&quot; Bhagavan then drew a p=\r\narallel\n&gt; from the Ramayana, saying,&quot;It seems that after Rama killed Ravana=\r\n, he forgot\n&gt; that he,Rama, had to go to Vaikuntha. So the Devatas took cou=\r\nnsel among\n&gt; themselves and then sent Yama, the God of Death,to him. Yama c=\r\name in the\n&gt; garb of an ascetic, and respectfully said, `The work for which=\r\n you have come\n&gt; is now over; please come to heaven&#39;. This is similar; `Swa=\r\nraj has been\n&gt; obtained; your work is over; why are you still here? Shouldn=\r\n&#39;t you go back?\n&gt; It is already late&#39;. Thus the Mahatma appears to have bee=\r\nn sent away.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked, &quot;The story you have just told us is from the Ut=\r\ntara Ramayana, is it\n&gt; not?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan: &quot;Yes, but not only there. It ha=\r\ns been written in another book\n&gt; that, in the case of Krishna, the arrow of=\r\n Vyadha was the cause of His\n&gt; death; similarly it happened with the Mahatm=\r\na.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yesterday, Harindranath Chattopadhyaya showed a photo of Mahatma, =\r\nand said,\n&gt; &quot;It is a pity that there was never any meeting between Gandhi a=\r\nnd Bhagavan.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan: &quot;Some time ago, he came to Tiruvannamalai.A me=\r\neting had been\n&gt; arranged for him to be held on the road around the hill, b=\r\neyond the Ashram.\n&gt; People here thought that he would come to the Ashram on=\r\n his way back, but\n&gt; owing to the pressure of the crowds it was impossible,=\r\n and he went away\n&gt; direct to the station. It seems that he very much regre=\r\ntted this\n&gt; afterwards. Shankarlal Banker was very keen on bringing him her=\r\ne, and in\n&gt; 1938, when Rajendra Prasad and Jamnalal Bajaj came here and saw=\r\n\n&gt; Skandasramam, they wanted to induce the Mahatma to stay there for some\n&gt;=\r\n time.But it did not happen. If at Sabarmati, or at Wardha anyone said that=\r\n\n&gt; he was mentally depressed, the Mahatma used to say, `Go to Ramanasramam =\r\nand\n&gt; come back after a month&#39;s stay there&#39;.When Ramaswami Reddiar went to =\r\nsee the\n&gt; Mahatma immediately after taking office as Chief Minister, Madras=\r\n State,the\n&gt; Mahatma, it seems, asked him for how long he had been going to=\r\n the\n&gt; Ramanasramam. When he answered that he had been going there for over=\r\n thirty\n&gt; years, the Mahatma said, `Is that so? I have tried thrice, but so=\r\n far have\n&gt; not been able to go there&#39;. What could he do? How could he come=\r\n here when he\n&gt; was not left alone for one moment?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan read in t=\r\noday&#39;s paper a report to the effect that the Mahatma had\n&gt; had from a dream=\r\n the night before the tragedy, a premonition of his death,\n&gt; and that there=\r\nfore,he had quickly disposed of his papers which had caused\n&gt; the delay in =\r\nhis coming to the prayer. Bhagavan commented, &quot;Yes. For\n&gt; enlightened peopl=\r\ne, will there not be that much of premonition? They will\n&gt; know, but will n=\r\not tell others.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: Letters from and Recollections of Sri Ramanas=\r\nramam Book\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Love And Love Alone\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramana=\r\nya\n&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
