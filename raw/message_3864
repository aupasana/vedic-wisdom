It appears to me that we never talk much about other things bu=\r\nt focus more on Brahmacharya, is it that we are very sensitive to a very na=\r\nrrow definition of it?\n\nMay be a way to look at it is to attach less import=\r\nance or look more deeply and in a broader way. We need to look in the light=\r\n of a person whether he or she is a celibate monk or a householder and acco=\r\nrdingly there could be slightly different ways of looking at it.\n\nIn all ho=\r\nnesty the defination of Brahmacharya is lot more broader and deeper, it is =\r\njust not about sex, semen and lustful thoughts in the mind. Most of the tim=\r\ne we gravitate towards a narrow defination only.\nI did read once the deeper=\r\n and broader definition but it escapes my mind. It has something to do with=\r\n the thoughts in mind.\n\nFor a householder in order to continue the kula or =\r\nthe family lineage\none needs to have children, for this there is nothing wr=\r\nong if breaking Brahmacharya.  \n\nAlso a house holder has some more complexi=\r\nty as there is a better half :-)\n\nIt is true that both celibates and marrie=\r\nd people have realized god and overcome duality. Many Celibates have fallen=\r\n down due to failing to keep the vow, some are caught and some live there w=\r\nhole life with \nDhambha (pretension) and cheating almighty god and themselv=\r\nes.\n\nI do agree that for men semen and its preseravation and ojas etc\nis im=\r\nportant no arguments there ... \n\nmay be someone more knowledgeable will she=\r\nd more deeper and broader meaning on Brahmacharya.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n"}}
