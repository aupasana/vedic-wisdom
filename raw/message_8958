Once at Ujjain, I saw a=\r\n dog in samadhi (or so I think!) and it\n&gt; &gt; was perfectly still for close t=\r\no 25 minutes! not even a murmur of movement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;One should not discus=\r\ns the subject of meditation; one immerse oneself in\n&gt; &gt; it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  One day A=\r\nvathar Sri Seshadri Swamigal came to Echammal&#39;s house and asked\n&gt; &gt; her, &quot;W=\r\nhat pooja you are doing?&quot; She replied, &quot;I keep Ramana Bhagawan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; pictur=\r\ne and yours and worship.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Swami asked her, &quot;How many days will you =\r\nbe doing Pooja? You should sit in\n&gt; &gt; meditation.&quot; She wanted to know how t=\r\no meditate? Swami demonstrated it to\n&gt; &gt; her in the Samadhi from 10 a.m. to=\r\n 4 p.m. without any movement, like a\n&gt; &gt; lifeless doll. Echammal and other =\r\nladies of the house having completed\n&gt; &gt; their household tasks sat by His s=\r\nide and observed Swami.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At 4 o&#39;clock Swami opened His eyes and said=\r\n, &quot;Did you see, Echammal?

Very interesting.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This reminds me of an incident wi=\r\nth a good friend of mine. There is an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; individual I know, who had never=\r\n chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He used to feel, as per his =\r\nown confession, no special love or attraction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for this mantra and bein=\r\ng born in a non-brahmin family, there was no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; religious-cultural occasi=\r\non where he was formally introduced to this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One day =\r\nwhile meditating on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random\n&gt; &gt;&gt; inspiration =\r\nto meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Gay=\r\natri mantra meant, and no idea at all of correct swara or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intonation. =\r\nSo he started chanting, mentally and soundlessly, the Savitur\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri =\r\nmantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of the mantra, he felt/saw -\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and =\r\nI describe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous, pure,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; f=\r\nlood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outside our\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told me, w=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to enter into that stream of Light above and see things from that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; perspective. But as long as there are impurities in the mind and body, =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is not possible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be =\r\nin a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impati=\r\nence of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, self-=\r\nassurance of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satwa leading to a deeper equanimity in mind and life is =\r\nneeded.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently, he also realized that there are some Tantrik =\r\nmantras of Ma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. The=\r\ny take a person to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the spiritual planes above.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So I asked hi=\r\nm why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Gayatri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra, s=\r\nince there was a nice experience. He said it would have pulled him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in =\r\nand he would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wh=\r\nich he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half way is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; not good.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reading the explanation your provided below, t=\r\nhat is :\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachod=\r\nayaat) our (naH)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight=\r\n. Without his light,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we would not be able to distinguish different obj=\r\nects. This is explained in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Aitaterya Upanishad &quot;The sun, having be=\r\ncome eyesight, entered the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; eyes&quot;.

He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gay=\r\natri mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It starts with a summary in 32 shlokas, followed by an in=\r\ntroduction. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then gives 4 explanations / meditations on the mantra -=\r\n- (1) gayatri, (2)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; narayana, (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; I am not attempting a literal or scholarly translation ... I&#39;ll try to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; summarize the main point, from a practical point of view. I&#39;ll start w=\r\nith\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the first of the meditations, on Gayatri.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  ----\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; The first meditation is the &quot;common&quot; understanding of the Gayatri mantra,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the Sun as the devata. This follows the famous verse from the Ag=\r\nastya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Smriti -- &quot;yo devaH savitA  .asmAkam dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prer=\r\nayet tasya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate u=\r\npon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the deva\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (devasya) th=\r\nat is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of the sun,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which is =\r\nexperienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to meditate\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upon.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whatever is experienced is easy to meditate upon, and that which i=\r\ns not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone can medi=\r\ntate upon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gayat=\r\nri mantra is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; always taken first.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vareNyam =3D whatever we ca=\r\nn ask / desire. Through all karmas and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upaasanaas, whatever fruits we =\r\nmay ask for is vareNyam. &quot;Savitaa&quot; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit of all karmas ... this=\r\n is taught in the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long\n&gt; &gt;&gt; explanation follows, w=\r\nhich is omitted here ].  We meditate upon the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; splendor of the sun, whi=\r\nch is vareNyam.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (p=\r\nrachodayaat) our (naH)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH).

Very interesting.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This reminds me of an incident with a good frie=\r\nnd of mine. There is an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; individual I know, who had never =\r\nchanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He used to feel,=\r\n as per his own confession, no special love or attraction&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n for this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin family, there was no&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introduced t=\r\no this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One da=\r\ny while meditating on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of wh=\r\nat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of correc=\r\nt swara or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intonation. So he started chanting, mentally a=\r\nnd soundlessly, the Savitur&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra. Within less t=\r\nhan 20-30 japas of the mantra, he felt/saw -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and I descri=\r\nbe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous, pure,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outside ou=\r\nr&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual i=\r\ndea, he told me, was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to enter into that stream of Light a=\r\nbove and see things from that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective. But as long as=\r\n there are impurities in the mind and body, it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is not pos=\r\nsible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience =\r\nof&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminatin=\r\ng, self-assurance of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satwa leading to a deeper equanimity=\r\n in mind and life is needed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently=\r\n, he also realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; which serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person=\r\n to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the spiritual planes above.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; So I asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa o=\r\nf Gayatri&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra, since there was a nice experience. He s=\r\naid it would have pulled him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in and he would not have bee=\r\nn able to continue the spiritual practices&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which he was a=\r\nlready doing for some time, and leaving something half way is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; not good.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Readin=\r\ng the explanation your provided below, that is :&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) ou=\r\nr (naH)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH).

He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on=\r\n the Gayatri mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It starts with a summary in 32 shlok=\r\nas, followed by an introduction. He&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then gives 4 explanat=\r\nions / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nara=\r\nyana, (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; I am not attempting a literal or scholarly translation ... I&#39;ll try to&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; summarize the main point, from a practical point of view. I=\r\n&#39;ll start with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the first of the meditations, on Gayatri.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  ----&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; The first meditation is the &quot;common&quot; understanding of the Gayatri mantra=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the Sun as the devata. This follows the famous ver=\r\nse from the Agastya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Smriti -- &quot;yo devaH savitA  .asmAkam =\r\ndhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yad bhargaH tad var=\r\neNyam upAsmahe&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon (dhii=\r\nmahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the deva&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (devasya=\r\n) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of the sun,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to medi=\r\ntate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upon.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whatever i=\r\ns experienced is easy to meditate upon, and that which is not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone can meditate u=\r\npon&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for th=\r\ne Gayatri mantra is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; always taken first.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vareNyam =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through all k=\r\narmas and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is v=\r\nareNyam. &quot;Savitaa&quot; is the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit of all karmas ... this is=\r\n taught in the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; explanation =\r\nfollows, which is omitted here ].  We meditate upon the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\nplendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nWe meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH).
