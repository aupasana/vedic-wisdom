In =\r\nthe mean-while some more questions. Some of these questions were asked prev=\r\niously in different threads on this forum, but probably you didn&#39;t have a c=\r\nhance to look at them, with all the activity that is happening over here. \n=\r\n\n1. I understand from different messages that you do Chandi Homam everyday.=\r\n How do you manage to do that? It should be taking at least 2.5 to 3 hours =\r\nto perform this, right? Do you do this in the evenings?\n\n2. What exactly is=\r\n Gayatri Chandas? (I have asked this previously). I find that Savitru Gayat=\r\nri Mantra has 24 letters, Brihaspati Gayatri has 21 letters (Vrishabham Cha=\r\nrshaneenam), Ganapati Moolamantram (aum Shreem hreem kleem gloum Gam Ganapa=\r\nthim....) having 28 letters. \n\n3. With only 5000+ years into a length of 43=\r\n2,000 years of Kaliyuga, are we at a point that we can say that Kali is dee=\r\npening? I shudder to think what would happen when kali really deepens fully=\r\n, say a few thousand years more from now. \n\n4. I have really heard great pr=\r\naises on this forum on Yogi Vimalananda and read great reviews on the Aghor=\r\na Series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. I have also read the great narrative=\r\ns by Mr. Rajarshi with a great interest. He is a fantastic narrator. I woul=\r\nd like to know your opinion on those books. The subject is fascinating for =\r\nme. \n\nRegards, \n\nNagraj Kota \n\n\n"}}
