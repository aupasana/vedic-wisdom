Is the=\r\nre any genuine difference between the experience of jagrat and that\nof drea=\r\nms?\n\nBh. None, except that jagrat appears to be more enduring than the othe=\r\nr to\nthe person who is in jagrat, though not so to the dreamer himself. The=\r\n\nperson in jagrat relates his dream to have sometimes covered hundreds of\ny=\r\nears, hence he calls it transitory, whereas actually there is not the\nsligh=\r\ntest difference between the nature\nof the two states.\n\nV. There is this dif=\r\nference: each time we return to jagrat, we come to the\nsame place, same peo=\r\nple, same activities and interests, which is not the\ncase with going to the=\r\n svapna state.\n\nBh. This is because things move very rapidly in dreams, as =\r\nthey appear now\nto you in jagrat. But each time you go to the dream world d=\r\no you feel being\na stranger in it? Do you not feel thoroughly at home with =\r\nthe people and\nplaces as you do here? Don=E2=80=99t you sometimes dream of =\r\nbeing a minister, or\nmeeting your father who had died in jagrat long ago, o=\r\nr seeing God seated on\na throne,etc., without noticing any incongruity in i=\r\nt? The dream is as real\nthen to you as jagrat is now. Where is the\ndifferen=\r\nce? If you call the dream illusion, why do you not do so to jagrat\nalso?\n\nC=\r\n. I suppose efforts have to be made in the waking state, which implies that=\r\n\nmoksha can be gained only in jagrat.\n\nBh. Quite so, awareness is necessary=\r\n for mind control; otherwise who is to\nmake the effort? You cannot make it =\r\nin sleep or under the influence of\ndrugs. Also mukti has to be gained in fu=\r\nll awareness, because the Reality\nitself is pure awareness.\n\nV. Arjuna saw =\r\nthe Divine Form of Sri Krishna. Was that vision true?\n\nBh. Sri Krishna star=\r\nted the discourse in Chapter II of the Bhagavad Gita\nwith: =E2=80=9CI have =\r\nno form,=E2=80=9D etc., but in Chapter XI, He said: =E2=80=9CI transcend th=\r\ne\nthree worlds . . . ,=E2=80=9D yet Arjuna saw these in Him.\n\nAgain Sri Kri=\r\nshna said: =E2=80=9CI am Time.=E2=80=9D Does time have a form? If the unive=\r\nrse\nis His form, should it not be uniform and changeless, He being the\nChan=\r\ngeless One?\n\nThe solution to these apparent contradictions lies in His stat=\r\nement to\nArjuna: =E2=80=9CSee in Me all you desire to see. . . ,=E2=80=9D w=\r\nhich means that His form\nvaries according to the desires and conceptions of=\r\n the seer.\n\nMen speak of divine visions, yet paint them differently with th=\r\ne seer\nhimself in the scene. Even hypnotists can make one see strange scene=\r\ns and\nphenomena, which you condemn as tricks and jugglery,whereas the forme=\r\nr you\nextol as Divine. Why is this difference?\n\nThe fact is that all sights=\r\n are unreal, whether they come from the senses or\nthe mind as pure concepts=\r\n.THIS IS THE TRUTH.\n\nSource: GURU RAMANA MEMORIES AND NOTES By S.
