I am going to try with =\r\noven soon.\n\nBy the way I am a Muslim in a social standpoint, since I was bo=\r\nrn in a Muslim family and continue to be a normal Muslim in the view of soc=\r\niety. But inside my heart and belief I am fully devoted to Sanatana Dharma.=\r\n It&#39;s sometimes a little difficult to keep such rituals [mantra japam, homa=\r\nm etc.] private from my friends and associates!\n\nYours,\nTanvir\n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A=\r\nnother Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last \n&gt; 3-4=\r\n days, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use \n&gt; the=\r\nm as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FUL=\r\nL&quot; coconut so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am dry=\r\ning sliced coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few day=\r\ns, will not it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am \n&gt; asking this b=\r\necause here no one has any idea about that, because no one \n&gt; even thinks o=\r\nf having &quot;burnable&quot; full coconuts. That is why.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; My two cents :\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\no make dry coconut you need heat more than the sunlight. Yes the coconut wi=\r\nll rot if you keep it outside in the sun for so long. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I long back =\r\nsaw in Food TV in US.....he kept the whole coconut in conventional oven for=\r\n one hour. Then he broke the shell with a hammer. The shell came out easily=\r\n and the whole coconut stayed intact. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think once the shell comes=\r\n out put the whole coconut in oven again, that way the water will dry out a=\r\nnd you will get a dry coconut.=C2=A0 You can shake the coconut to see if th=\r\nere is water inside or not and accordingly experiment. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this w=\r\norks...good luck with your homams. Its amazing how god makes his devotees d=\r\no homams even in muslim land. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Priya\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
