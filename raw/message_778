Thakur said he was one of Lord \nKri=\r\nshna&#39;s eternal playmates.\n\nWords and actions of great masters like Swami Br=\r\nahmananada are not always \neasy to understand. He may have had some subtle =\r\nmotivations when he said \nthat.\n\nThere are many people who are prone to pri=\r\nde and do not realize god despite \nabstinence and other wonderful ascetic p=\r\nractices. They let those ascetic \npractices fill them with pride and never =\r\nreach the final goal. If he wanted \nto subtly remind such people the final =\r\ngoal and remove the mental focus on \nintermediate steps, he may say somethi=\r\nng like that.\n\nIf he wanted someone to ponder over whether someone else can=\r\n give one god or \none has to do sadhana and individual effort, then also he=\r\n may something like \nthat.\n\nIf he wanted to dismiss the notion that his ble=\r\nssings would remove lust from \npeople, with hidden and subtle sircasm that =\r\nhe was quite capable of, then \nalso he may have said that. It is subtler th=\r\nan sircastically saying &quot;while \nwe are at it, why not ask for god? I may as=\r\n well grant you god&quot;. He may have \nwanted to make the person understand the=\r\n need of individual effort as \nopposed to getting something (say, brahmacha=\r\nrya) with his blessings.\n\n* * *\n\nBrahmacharya and other practices give high=\r\ner and higher control over self. \nWhen the control over self is *perfect*, =\r\none may find god.\n\nAnother person may find god due to the grace of a guru a=\r\nnd brahmacharya and \nother practices may come to one in a perfect form *alo=\r\nng with* that. That is \nalso possible. It is not necessary to engage in a c=\r\nertain practice for a \nlong duration to realize god. If one is already very=\r\n pure from all previous \nlife efforts and the impurities of this life exist=\r\n only on the surface, it \nmay be possible for a sadguru to free such a pers=\r\non in a moment and make him \nrealize god.\n\nHowever, one should start climbi=\r\nng the mountain when there is no certainty \nthat one will suddenly disappea=\r\nr at the base and find oneself on the peak in \na blessed moment, though tha=\r\nt is possible!\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Swami Brahmananda was doing several penances in=\r\n Vrindavan, Vijaykrishna \nGoswami, who had know him for a long time in Calc=\r\nutta, asked &quot;The Master \ngave you all that is covetable in spiritual life: =\r\nvisions and samadhi. Why \nthen do you still practise so much austerity?&quot; Br=\r\nahmananda humbly answered: \n&quot;The experiences and visions I got by his grace=\r\n, I am now trying to attain \nas my permanent possession.&quot;\n\nDespite visions =\r\nof gods and samadhi, he know that his realization was not \nperfect and ther=\r\ne was more to be perfected!\n\nObserving his hardship, rigorous disciplines, =\r\nand long meditation and \nprayer, Swami Subodhananda once told him &quot;The Mast=\r\ner looked upon you as his \nson. You are the veritable son of the Lord. It d=\r\noes not befit you to sit \nlike a beggar seeking his grace.&quot; Brahmananda rep=\r\nlied: &quot;What you say, \nbrother, is true. The Master loved us so dearly that =\r\nhe gave us everything \nhe had to give. Still we have not attained peace. Th=\r\nis shows that it now \nlies with us to do the rest for the fulfillment of li=\r\nfe&#39;s objective. Uddhava \nwas Krishna&#39;s dear friend, you Krishna said to him=\r\n: &#39;If you want to properly \nrealize any spiritual truth, you must go to som=\r\ne solitary place and practise \nausterity. I can grant you some miraculous v=\r\nisions, if you like. But that \nwon&#39;t be enough. It is much greater to conce=\r\nntrate and meditate on Him.&#39; \nIndeed, without meditation and contemplation =\r\nnone can know anything about \nGod.&quot;\n\nSome may climb a small hill, think it =\r\nis Mt Everest and start calling \nthemselves realized. But the disciples of =\r\nRamakrishna like Swami Brahmananda \nwere different.\n\nIn order to understand=\r\n the motivation behind specific words, you have to \nunderstand him better.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nMost sishyas of Ramakrishna did not marry. Some married, but never =\r\nhad \nsexual relations with wives (e.g. Swami Yogananda, who married forcefu=\r\nlly, \nand Swami Shivananda). Swami Brahmananda was one who not only married=\r\n but \nhad a child too! He was at one stage troubled by lust and found it ve=\r\nry \ndifficult to conquer it. Thakur placed his hand on his heart and chante=\r\nd a \nmantra. Swami Brahmananda revealed that he never felt lust after that.=\r\n\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana=\r\n\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;ra=\r\njarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, =\r\nDecember 16, 2008 2:21 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamchary=\r\na\n\n&gt; Dear Members\n&gt;\n&gt; I was re reading this thread on the light of somethin=\r\ng I had come\n&gt; across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I=\r\n was\n&gt; reading a book on his life and various incidents connected to him as=\r\n\n&gt; observed by other saints and his brother disciples.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Brahmanand=\r\na or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of Thakur.\n&gt; And no doubt a great=\r\n spiritual super giant.

It was a gene=\r\nrally accepted idea among the disciples\n&gt; of Thakur that any one who is ble=\r\nssed by Rakhal Maharaj will never\n&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack o=\r\nf Brahmacharya.\n&gt;\n&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for=\r\n his\n&gt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a\n&gt; bles=\r\nsing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you\n&gt; people alwa=\r\nys come asking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any one\n&gt; come to me asking m=\r\ne to give him/her God? Isn&#39;t God the final aim of\n&gt; everything.. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is i=\r\nt possible for someone who cannot maintain brahmacharya to reach\n&gt; God?

Someone\n&gt;&gt; else may have to=\r\n first overcome his lust even to have a vision of\n&gt; the deity.\n&gt;&gt; What is g=\r\nood for goose is not good for gander. In general, it is\n&gt; good to try\n&gt;&gt; to=\r\n overcome lust if it is possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Several &quot;normal college going peopl=\r\ne&quot; were taken under his wings\n&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transform=\r\ned into spiritual giants.\n&gt; Swami\n&gt;&gt; Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami =\r\nYogananda etc were college\n&gt; students\n&gt;&gt; when they met Ramakrishna.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; B=\r\nut it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of\n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s\n&gt;&gt; d=\r\nisciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust with\n&gt; his\n&gt;&gt; b=\r\nlessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at all easy\n&gt; to kill=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; completely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go=\r\n out of the\n&gt; mind. Set a\n&gt;&gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or som=\r\ne period like that\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if =\r\nthoughts come.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in o=\r\nvercoming\n&gt; the basic\n&gt;&gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mor=\r\neover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; suppress d=\r\nesires but remove them from the root\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; True, suppressing desire will ma=\r\nke the desire come back later.\n&gt; But, if one\n&gt;&gt; keeps fulfilling desires, t=\r\nhey never end!! This is the nature of\n&gt; desire.\n&gt;&gt; Whether one desires mone=\r\ny or knowledge (of anything other than\n&gt; Self) or\n&gt;&gt; physical pleasures, th=\r\ne desire will never end no matter how much\n&gt; one gets.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Removing desir=\r\ne from the root often requires suppressing the\n&gt; desire\n&gt;&gt; temporarily. But=\r\n the thing to remember from the Aghora book is\n&gt; that just\n&gt;&gt; suppressing d=\r\nesire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing\n&gt; desires, but do\n&gt;&gt; remember=\r\n that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep\n&gt; working on it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vimal=\r\nananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not in 6 =\r\nyears at least in 10-12 years\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Spiritu=\r\nal progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is\n&gt; one thing.\n&gt;&gt; Th=\r\ne most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become\n&gt; attached to\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions and\n&gt;&gt; deve=\r\nloping a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are =\r\nseveral things in spiritual progress. They all come\n&gt; together! One\n&gt;&gt; pers=\r\non may develop detachment to actions and possessions and\n&gt; brahmacharya\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nmay become easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya\n&gt; first an=\r\nd\n&gt;&gt; detachment may become easy as a result and come later. Various\n&gt; signs=\r\n of\n&gt;&gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can\n&gt; c=\r\nhange from\n&gt;&gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inabil=\r\nity\n&gt; to get\n&gt;&gt; something. It may be possible to work it out from another a=\r\nngle!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=\r\nic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. =\r\nnet\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; Namaste sir\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i know you are lot busy but since =\r\ni couldn;t ask this question on a\n&gt;&gt; public forum as it may probably offend=\r\n others.\n&gt;&gt; If you have time ,if you could please reply.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was thinki=\r\nng this for many days\n&gt;&gt; that as mentioned in recent thread on brahamcharya=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt; it was important to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to ask that\n&gt;&gt; =\r\neven vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust though\n&gt;&gt; he h=\r\nad his deity with him from the very early in life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; how can normal col=\r\nlege going people like me who don&#39;t even have a\n&gt;&gt; deity obtain this goal.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for few months but\n&gt;&gt; aft=\r\ner that i am not able to hold it ,\n&gt;&gt; and even if i maintain some physical =\r\nchastity it refuses to go out\n&gt;&gt; of mind\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Moreover, what i read in AGH=\r\nORA was the important thing is not\n&gt;&gt; suppress desires but remove them from=\r\n the root\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt;&gt; Though i=\r\n have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of\n&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt;&gt; but i do=\r\nn&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in maintaing\n&gt;&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The only reason for whic=\r\nh i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt;&gt; vimalananda took such a long time=\r\n probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt;&gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nidentity from this that would be appreciable\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; if what i worte offended=\r\n you please delete this mail\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  =\r\n    Connect with friends all over the world.

Thakur said he was one of Lord &lt;BR&gt;Krishna&#39;s eternal playmat=\r\nes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Words and actions of great masters like Swami Brahmananada are n=\r\not always &lt;BR&gt;easy to understand. He may have had some subtle motivations w=\r\nhen he said &lt;BR&gt;that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are many people who are prone to pride a=\r\nnd do not realize god despite &lt;BR&gt;abstinence and other wonderful ascetic pr=\r\nactices. They let those ascetic &lt;BR&gt;practices fill them with pride and neve=\r\nr reach the final goal. If he wanted &lt;BR&gt;to subtly remind such people the f=\r\ninal goal and remove the mental focus on &lt;BR&gt;intermediate steps, he may say=\r\n something like that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If he wanted someone to ponder over whether so=\r\nmeone else can give one god or &lt;BR&gt;one has to do sadhana and individual eff=\r\nort, then also he may something like &lt;BR&gt;that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If he wanted to dismi=\r\nss the notion that his blessings would remove lust from &lt;BR&gt;people, with hi=\r\ndden and\n subtle sircasm that he was quite capable of, then &lt;BR&gt;also he may=\r\n have said that. It is subtler than sircastically saying &quot;while &lt;BR&gt;we are =\r\nat it, why not ask for god? I may as well grant you god&quot;. He may have &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nanted to make the person understand the need of individual effort as &lt;BR&gt;op=\r\nposed to getting something (say, brahmacharya) with his blessings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*=\r\n * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brahmacharya and other practices give higher and higher control=\r\n over self. &lt;BR&gt;When the control over self is *perfect*, one may find god.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another person may find god due to the grace of a guru and brahmacha=\r\nrya and &lt;BR&gt;other practices may come to one in a perfect form *along with* =\r\nthat. That is &lt;BR&gt;also possible. It is not necessary to engage in a certain=\r\n practice for a &lt;BR&gt;long duration to realize god. If one is already very pu=\r\nre from all previous &lt;BR&gt;life efforts and the impurities of this life exist=\r\n only on the surface, it &lt;BR&gt;may be possible for a sadguru to free such a\n =\r\nperson in a moment and make him &lt;BR&gt;realize god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, one should=\r\n start climbing the mountain when there is no certainty &lt;BR&gt;that one will s=\r\nuddenly disappear at the base and find oneself on the peak in &lt;BR&gt;a blessed=\r\n moment, though that is possible!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Swami Brahmanand=\r\na was doing several penances in Vrindavan, Vijaykrishna &lt;BR&gt;Goswami, who ha=\r\nd know him for a long time in Calcutta, asked &quot;The Master &lt;BR&gt;gave you all =\r\nthat is covetable in spiritual life: visions and samadhi. Why &lt;BR&gt;then do y=\r\nou still practise so much austerity?&quot; Brahmananda humbly answered: &lt;BR&gt;&quot;The=\r\n experiences and visions I got by his grace, I am now trying to attain &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nas my permanent possession.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Despite visions of gods and samadhi, he=\r\n know that his realization was not &lt;BR&gt;perfect and there was more to be per=\r\nfected!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Observing his hardship, rigorous disciplines, and long medit=\r\nation and &lt;BR&gt;prayer, Swami Subodhananda once told him &quot;The Master\n looked =\r\nupon you as his &lt;BR&gt;son. You are the veritable son of the Lord. It does not=\r\n befit you to sit &lt;BR&gt;like a beggar seeking his grace.&quot; Brahmananda replied=\r\n: &quot;What you say, &lt;BR&gt;brother, is true. The Master loved us so dearly that h=\r\ne gave us everything &lt;BR&gt;he had to give. Still we have not attained peace. =\r\nThis shows that it now &lt;BR&gt;lies with us to do the rest for the fulfillment =\r\nof life&#39;s objective. Uddhava &lt;BR&gt;was Krishna&#39;s dear friend, you Krishna sai=\r\nd to him: &#39;If you want to properly &lt;BR&gt;realize any spiritual truth, you mus=\r\nt go to some solitary place and practise &lt;BR&gt;austerity. I can grant you som=\r\ne miraculous visions, if you like. But that &lt;BR&gt;won&#39;t be enough. It is much=\r\n greater to concentrate and meditate on Him.&#39; &lt;BR&gt;Indeed, without meditatio=\r\nn and contemplation none can know anything about &lt;BR&gt;God.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some may =\r\nclimb a small hill, think it is Mt Everest and start calling &lt;BR&gt;themselves=\r\n realized. But the disciples of Ramakrishna like Swami\n Brahmananda &lt;BR&gt;wer=\r\ne different.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In order to understand the motivation behind specific w=\r\nords, you have to &lt;BR&gt;understand him better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most sishy=\r\nas of Ramakrishna did not marry. Some married, but never had &lt;BR&gt;sexual rel=\r\nations with wives (e.g. Swami Yogananda, who married forcefully, &lt;BR&gt;and Sw=\r\nami Shivananda). Swami Brahmananda was one who not only married but &lt;BR&gt;had=\r\n a child too! He was at one stage troubled by lust and found it very &lt;BR&gt;di=\r\nfficult to conquer it. Thakur placed his hand on his heart and chanted a &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;mantra. Swami Brahmananda revealed that he never felt lust after that.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;ra=\r\njarshi14&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14%40yahoo.co.in&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Tuesday, December 16, 2008 2:21 AM&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Members=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was re reading this thread on the light of something I h=\r\nad come&lt;BR&gt;&gt; across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. =\r\nI was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reading a book on his life and various incidents connected to=\r\n him as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; observed by other saints and his brother disciples.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of Thaku=\r\nr.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to say h=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had reincarnated o=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;&gt; this plane.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; During his stay in various monastarie=\r\ns of the Ramakrishna Mission,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; often other monks used to send new in=\r\nitiates to Rakhal Maharaj for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hios blessings. It was a generally ac=\r\ncepted idea among the disciples&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Thakur that any one who is\n bles=\r\nsed by Rakhal Maharaj will never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; again be troubled by problems of l=\r\nack of Brahmacharya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal M=\r\naharaj asking for his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me b=\r\nrahmacharya as a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj sa=\r\nid, &quot;Why do you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; people always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was doe=\r\ns not any one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; come to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn&#39;t God t=\r\nhe final aim of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; everything.. &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is it possible for s=\r\nomeone who cannot maintain brahmacharya to reach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; God?

Someone&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; else may have to firs=\r\nt overcome his lust even to have a vision of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the deity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n What is good for goose is not good for gander. In general, it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; g=\r\nood to try&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; Several &quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken under his wings&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritual=\r\n giants.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yo=\r\ngananda etc were college&lt;BR&gt;&gt; students&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; when they met Ramakri=\r\nshna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is not easy to overcome lust at all. S=\r\neveral of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; disciples also struggled with =\r\nit initially and overcame lust with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;\n blessings. Lus=\r\nt is a very basic human instinct and not at all easy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to kill&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; completely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the=\r\n thought does not go out of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind. Set a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; rule for 20=\r\n days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcomi=\r\nng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the basic&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important=\r\n thing is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the ro=\r\not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire co=\r\nme back later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, if one&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps fulfilling desires, th=\r\ney never end!! This is the nature of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether on=\r\ne desires money or knowledge (of anything other\n than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Self) or&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how much&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; one gets.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Removing desire from the root often=\r\n requires suppressing the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; temporarily. But the t=\r\nhing to remember from the Aghora book is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that just&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; supp=\r\nressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; desires, but=\r\n do&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; working on it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The only reason for wh=\r\nich i keep trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; vimalananda took =\r\nsuch a long time probasbly i can also do it , if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; not in 6 =\r\nyears at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the right spi=\r\nrit!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things an=\r\nd brahmacharya is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The most fundamental thing=\r\n is to overcome ego and not\n become&lt;BR&gt;&gt; attached to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; things.=\r\n Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dev=\r\neloping a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. They all come&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; together! One&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; person may develop detachment to actions and =\r\npossessions and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; brahmacharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; may become easy as a resul=\r\nt. One person may achieve brahmacharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; first and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; detach=\r\nment may become easy as a result and come later. Various&lt;BR&gt;&gt; signs of&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; change from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappoi=\r\nnted by your inability&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to get&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; something. It may be poss=\r\nible to work it out from another angle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regard=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- ---------\n --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan=\r\n nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------\n --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; Namaste sir&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; i know you are lot busy but si=\r\nnce i couldn;t ask this question on a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; public forum as it may pr=\r\nobably offend others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have time ,if you could please rep=\r\nly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I was thinking this for many days&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhat as mentioned in recent thread on brahamcharya,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; it was impor=\r\ntant to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to ask that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; even vim=\r\nalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust though&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; he =\r\nhad his deity with him from the very early in life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n how can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; deity obtain this goal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Though i try to maintain physical b=\r\nrahamcharya for few months but&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; after that i am not able to hold=\r\n it ,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and even if i\n maintain some physical chastity it refuses=\r\n to go out&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Moreover, what i rea=\r\nd in AGHORA was the important thing is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; suppress desires but=\r\n remove them from the root&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; So, how can i finish it =\r\ncompletely from my mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s bo=\r\nok on Practice of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; but i don&#39;t think i have=\r\n made any spiritual progress in maintaing&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you =\r\ncan also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; i=\r\ndentity from this that would be appreciable&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; if what=\r\n i worte offended you\n please delete this mail&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; rega=\r\nrds&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;=\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--6--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Add more friends to your=\r\n messenger and enjoy! &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_6=\r\n/*http://messenger.yahoo.com/invite/&quot;&gt; Invite them now.&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-1181688343-1229577302=:65837--\r\n\n"}}
