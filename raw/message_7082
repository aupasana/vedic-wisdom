For the main homam, you can use any of the \nthousands of Veda mantras available for Indra or simply &quot;OM indrAya \nnamaH svAhA&quot;.\n\n(2) You CAN visualize a homa kundam and do a mental homam when it is not \npossible to do a physical homam. In fact, instead of visualizing an \nexternal homa kundam, you can visualize a homa kundam at the base of \nyour spine and perform homam in that homa kundam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOn Wed, Aug 10, 2011 at 2:03 AM, &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:\n\nDear Narasimha,\n\nI wanted to write for several reasons, and chose to send a private \nmessage instead of an e-mail to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup - I&#39;ve been \na member there for some months but rarely write.\n\nFirst and most importantly, thank you - to both the beautiful Divine \nMother who guides us with such loving patience, and to you who serves as \na vessel for her wisdom. I have learned so much since joining the \ne-group some months ago, and look forward to the messages I receive \nevery day. Thank you especially for your message about Sri Krishna&#39;s \nwords in Gita, explaining the words &quot;those who worship Me come to Me,&quot; \netc.\n\nI have two questions to ask which I hope are not burdensome, and the \nfirst is this: Recently I have learned of drought conditions in east \nIndia, and closer to home in Texas, as well. Sri Indra is my ishta-deva, \nand I will have a rare opportunity to perform homam sometime this month, \nthanks to a friend offering a large backyard for a weekend. I would like \nto do a homam to ask for help against the suffering of these droughts. \nAre there any changes I may make to your regular homam procedure, to use \nit for Indra?\n\nThe other question I have is about homam in general. For those who wish \nto perform this rite daily but lack the ability, would there be any \nvalue in practicing homam as a meditation - in mentally visualizing the \nkund, offerings, and proceeding through all of the steps and mantras as \nyour manual teaches? On the one hand, the physical manifestation of Agni \nis vital to carry offerings, but perhaps the agni within us might serve \nin a similar manner if fed with pure-hearted, devoted meditation?\n\nPlease do pardon me if either of these questions has already been \naddressed via the group, or if I&#39;m reaching you at a particularly busy \ntime. I hope that this message finds you well and enjoying Her many \nblessings!\n\nThank you, again,\n&lt;deleted&gt;\n\n"}}
