Rao&quot; &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Veda mantras are in a different league compa=\r\nred to other mantras. As\nI said \n&gt; earlier, it is possible to achieve the o=\r\nne-pointed focus of mind on any \n&gt; combination of sounds. When one&#39;s mind r=\r\nepeats the same combination of \n&gt; sounds over and over again, eventually on=\r\ne&#39;s mind may lose all other \n&gt; thoughts and become absorbed in that combina=\r\ntion of sounds. THEN\none&#39;s mind \n&gt; experiences the energy represented by th=\r\nat combination of sounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Different combinations of sounds have differ=\r\nent energies. But\nexperiencing \n&gt; the energy of any combination of sounds i=\r\ns a better experience for\nthe mind \n&gt; than the regular chaotic experiences =\r\nmind has in a cacaphony of\nthoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; The energy represented by properl=\r\ny chanted Veda mantras is in a\ndifferent \n&gt; league. However, it is almost i=\r\nmpossible to chant Veda mantras\nperfectly in \n&gt; today&#39;s times. The knowledg=\r\ne is lost. The way people chant them, veda \n&gt; mantras get corrupted and the=\r\ny end up working like other mantras and\ndo not \n&gt; really act as veda mantra=\r\ns. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, one \n&gt; experiences the energy of =\r\na corrupted version and not of the\noriginal veda \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; The expres=\r\nsion &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the actual\nsavitru \n&gt; gayat=\r\nri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat savitur&quot; and\nends \n&gt; wit=\r\nh &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatri chantin=\r\ng. I only hummed\nthe ups \n&gt; and downs to show the intonation. I was instruc=\r\nted to never chant\nSavitru \n&gt; Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually speaking, th=\r\nat mantra is my food\nand I get \n&gt; whatever little energy I have from it. In=\r\n order to continue doing my\ndharma \n&gt; in the world, I will need to be selfi=\r\nsh with my food. I can share\neverything \n&gt; else with the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Astrol=\r\nogy knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficient to give \n&gt; perfec=\r\nt guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job than\nastrology \n&gt; as=\r\n we understand it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen my guru make some interesting mantra su=\r\nggestions. For\nexample, I \n&gt; once mentioned to Manish a friend who visits m=\r\ne often and meditates\nwhen I \n&gt; do homam. Manish said, &quot;he will not be inte=\r\nrested in doing homam by\nhimself. \n&gt; If at all he does, it will not be Maha=\r\nganapathi homam or Chandi\nhomam. Teach \n&gt; him Vishnu sahasra naama homam. H=\r\ne MAY be interested in that. He\nwill like \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama stotram.&quot;=\r\n I had not mentioned much about that\nperson to \n&gt; Manish and only said the =\r\nname. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama\nstotra is \n&gt; indeed a favorite pr=\r\nayer of that person. Another time, I met a\nperson who \n&gt; loves Ganapathi at=\r\nharva seersham and chants it everyday and\ninterested in \n&gt; doing Mahaganapa=\r\nthi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can do \n&gt; Mahaganapathi homam. =\r\nBut eventually there is another sadhana he\nneeds to do. \n&gt; He needs to chan=\r\nt Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one\nwhole \n&gt; year. It will t=\r\nransform his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything\nabout that \n&gt; person to Ma=\r\nnish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he was\na sishya \n&gt; of a gr=\r\neat spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas \n&gt; (conside=\r\nred to be born with  Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to me\nlater that \n&gt; his =\r\nguru had also advised him in the past to just stick to Hanuman\nchalisa! \n&gt; =\r\nInterestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, M=\r\nanish tells me at other times that he knows nothing and\nsays \n&gt; whatever co=\r\nmes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance to \n&gt; someone, he sa=\r\nys it is because the Mother wanted someone to get correct \n&gt; guidance and h=\r\ne is just a nimitta.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that a sadguru with very limited indivi=\r\ndual ego and in\ntune with \n&gt; Nature will be able to give far better guidanc=\r\ne in spiritual sadhana\nthan \n&gt; astrology as we know it today.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Mars=\r\n and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.S=\r\nriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinit=\r\nakuma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 04,=\r\n 2009 3:45 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; dear narasimh=\r\na ji and friends,\n&gt; &gt; namaste!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i understand that the syllables / me=\r\ntre of the mantra is very\n&gt; &gt; important. that is why (probably) mantra was =\r\npassed on from the guru\n&gt; &gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody even s=\r\naid that in the end\n&gt; &gt; it is the metre only that remains in the mantra...a=\r\nnd not even the\n&gt; &gt; words. something like the smile of the cheshire cat rem=\r\naining even\n&gt; &gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alice in the wonderland.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to my consciousness the\n&gt; &gt; gay=\r\natri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have been relying on\n&gt; &gt; the i=\r\nnternet. the first thing that kind of took my breath away was\n&gt; &gt; the layer=\r\ns and layers of meaning attached to each word of the\n&gt; &gt; mantra. that is pr=\r\nobably because all sanskrit words are like\n&gt; &gt; that....you peel one layer a=\r\nnd another layer lies below..and then\n&gt; &gt; still another and another....\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; but more importantly (perhaps) is the different ways this mantra\n&gt; &gt; g=\r\nets recited. i tried to count the syllables to see whether they\n&gt; &gt; added u=\r\npto 24. they almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; &gt; whether om=\r\n in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly\n&gt; &gt; is, but i wa=\r\nnt to be sure.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the wo=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n&gt; &gt; ren=\r\ndering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes\n&gt; &gt; two syl=\r\nlables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n&gt; &gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is s=\r\ntretched to 3 syllables instead of 2.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;r=\r\night&quot; rendition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had po=\r\nsted his rendition\n&gt; &gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not b=\r\neen able to find\n&gt; &gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me abou=\r\nt this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i would also like to know the importance of the number of s=\r\nyllables\n&gt; &gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for different persons\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are sometimes / always\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (?) reflected in the astrological chart. maybe a guru by just\n&gt; &gt; looking =\r\nat a person can know intuitively what is the &quot;right&quot; mantra\n&gt; &gt; for the per=\r\nson. maybe a good astrologer can also do the same.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i know this is n=\r\not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking\n&gt; &gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot;=\r\n of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro\n&gt; &gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus=\r\n lagna...throough mantra. These\n&gt; &gt; planets aspect all the other planets (j=\r\nupiter, sun and mercury in\n&gt; &gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third house).\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; thankyou!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; love and best wishes,&#39;\n&gt; &gt; vinita\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
