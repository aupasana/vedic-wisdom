See all the saints. You are unlikely to see even=\r\n one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(=\r\nwhen looked at by an external observer). However the internal joy of Kundal=\r\nini is something which fills that saint so completely that some great ones =\r\nwere completely unaware of their external problems.\n&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit=\r\n Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes=A0compare =\r\nKundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s =\r\nlook of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The bab=\r\ny knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is tha=\r\nt of joy.\n&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they have to learn surrender. =\r\nThis surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painl=\r\ness process unlike that of the baby.\n&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;r=\r\neal=A0surges&quot; of energy may=A0result=A0in mental havoc.=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secon=\r\ndly, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of=\r\n japa.

A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to li=\r\nke irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all=A0that must be regimentalised, then appropriate =\r\nherbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application o=\r\nf oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro=\r\n basti in difficult real cases may be useful.\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small=A0Hom=\r\nas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That=\r\n should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two years.\n&gt; &gt;In pure non re=\r\nal cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V=\r\n.R. Rao  wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatri=\r\nc problems may expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or=\r\n may not be one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that Kundalini spon=\r\ntaneously rising through various nadis without one having gone through prop=\r\ner preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and develop=\r\nment of detachment) CAN create havoc!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundal=\r\nini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana, while many serious =\r\nsadhakas may not experience it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT =\r\nan achievement. It is just A SMALL\n&gt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limi=\r\nted identity.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from =\r\none&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace =\r\n(realized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into it w=\r\nhen it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the =\r\npalace still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to=\r\n Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The f=\r\normer approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can pro=\r\ngress towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences=\r\n. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and puttin=\r\ng sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini ris=\r\ne in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may b=\r\ne getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even wa=\r\nnt it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not =\r\nto fancy too many specific\n&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in gran=\r\nting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right=\r\n now, arising from YOUR\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives=\r\n you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else.=\r\n For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as=\r\n a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and p=\r\nray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy,=\r\n but not have any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt; case, one may deeply de=\r\nsire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt; as a tiger or a dog and =\r\nact in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt; experience. Basically, p=\r\neople keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; somethi=\r\nng they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one=\r\n deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and o=\r\nne&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be =\r\nborn in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there =\r\nis enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0\n&gt;  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary=\r\n or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it a=\r\nnd it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it f=\r\nrom a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind =\r\ncomplex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nIf our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are inco=\r\nrrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete =\r\nrealization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind co=\r\nmplex, without being scared?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioni=\r\nng is overcome, is far better than\n&gt;  Kundalini rise forced when some reall=\r\ny undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When =\r\none transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, =\r\nanother notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the su=\r\nrface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there m=\r\nay be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings=\r\n on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint=\r\n etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be =\r\na great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated=\r\n X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kund=\r\nalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person ma=\r\ny show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck bad=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditio=\r\nning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause se=\r\nrious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is t=\r\no NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome y=\r\nour\n&gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to e=\r\nmphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people =\r\naround you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negati=\r\nve attachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt; whether your Kundalini=\r\n rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemie=\r\ns (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt; not. If your ability to r=\r\nesist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini i=\r\ns fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you completely overcome =\r\nthem, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt; will automatically ascend to the t=\r\nop and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal dei=\r\nty. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simp=\r\nly do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is=\r\n the plain and bare fact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and ple=\r\nase give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and =\r\nplease protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something y=\r\nou want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, de=\r\nsires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s f=\r\nascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything =\r\nLord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord=\r\n&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord w=\r\nith fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notio=\r\nns experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking=\r\n of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as sa=\r\nid below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;=\r\nchipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, bu=\r\nt it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from Go=\r\nd&#39;s\n&gt;  protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like gra=\r\nve danger that one should run away from!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or=\r\n surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is tem=\r\nporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doin=\r\ng your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment an=\r\nd a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can p=\r\nrotect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning a=\r\nnd impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness=\r\n) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how ligh=\r\nt your conditioning is.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;-------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 201=\r\n3 6:05 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=A0YES=A0 SIR=A0 , perfectly correct=A0=A0 ,=A0but intense b=\r\nhakthi and saranagathi=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka an=\r\nd remove most of the hurdles .=A0=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out=\r\n any personal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the=\r\n inner planes who play havoc with the=A0 psyche .=A0 Once we are under the =\r\nprotection of=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=A0 disturbances will definite=\r\nly=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts =\r\nof purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-body st=\r\nructure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more equani=\r\nmity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Onc=\r\ne and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identif=\r\ny with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind i=\r\ns must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very =\r\nhelpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open =\r\nup the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of which ar=\r\ne not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a ch=\r\nance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inh=\r\nernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence c=\r\nonstant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n&gt;  vital. 4 - While someday or other=\r\n every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and ri=\r\nsing up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psyc=\r\nhology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with=\r\n various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individu=\r\nal, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remain=\r\n as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high st=\r\nress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess =\r\nof various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing seriou=\r\ns havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are ther=\r\ne, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a d=\r\niagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectif=\r\ny the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing mor=\r\ne than an intelligent guess work.\n&gt;  Sometimes it will have results, someti=\r\nmes not.

This has involved out-of-=\r\nbody experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian ori=\r\ngin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she sea=\r\nrched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically=\r\n wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to dera=\r\nnged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as hav=\r\ning a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this h=\r\nas triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry=\r\n. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine,=\r\n and as we have no treatments for deranged\n&gt;  kundalini, we struggle to hel=\r\np them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with =\r\nthis lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakene=\r\nd. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the=\r\n deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is someth=\r\ning she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her =\r\nproblem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as=\r\n the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her,=\r\n or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samarit=\r\nans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know o=\r\nf)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhan=\r\na so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the =\r\nbhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your ins=\r\ntrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n&gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s will.
