You also suggest that to overcome the force of Past impressions, It r=\r\nequires to surrender to the Almighty.\n\nIt is required to consciously examin=\r\ne our habits and tendencies and after enough reasoning and discrimination, =\r\nif we found that it needs to be overcome, then it is best to surrender and =\r\nalso try as much possible to generate counter force.\n\nI think that is what =\r\ni suggested in one of the message. that is how any tendencies can be overco=\r\nme. only one point i need to mention that i see the need of talking about v=\r\negetarianism or non-vegetarianism because that may serve as a vital food fo=\r\nr thought in somebody...somewhere.\n\nI think, i conveyed whatever i needed t=\r\no on this thread of Veg-nonveg. in my many messages, i&#39;ve conveyed most of =\r\nthe things which was accumulating from long years. i&#39;ve become empty now!!!=\r\n\n\nRespectful regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rama na=\r\nrayanan &lt;sree88ganesha@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; SARVAM GYANANANDAMAYAMAUM GURUBHYO N=\r\nAMAH\n&gt; Dear Utpal & others,\n&gt; Namaste. The physical structure of human bein=\r\ngs, animals, birds and that of plants differ. The tools provided for the in=\r\ntake of food are different. When attempts are being made to consume food be=\r\nyond the scope of tools provided(teeth structure for eg.,) for the present =\r\nincarnation it only means the bio-memories are strong. Jiva could have pick=\r\ned up any body at random in an unconscious state in the past. The need of t=\r\nhe hour is to have a cognitive shift from unconscious state of functioning =\r\nto conscious state of functioning. There is no need to talk for vegetariani=\r\nsm or non-vegetarianism.

I just saw a few mails from t=\r\nhe vegetarianism thread. Just a few quick points.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Self-identification of human beings and animals with bod=\r\ny and body parts is much much stronger and denser than that of plants and t=\r\nrees. Self-identification of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf o=\r\nr flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion e=\r\nxperienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut o=\r\nff in an animal or a human being, the emotion experienced is much stronger.=\r\n Even after death, an animal may identify with the body and think of it as =\r\n&quot;I&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The kaarmik debt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, =\r\nwhich the animal&#39;s mind considers as a part of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached t=\r\no, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables=\r\n or fruits of a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; As long as=\r\n we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. B=\r\nut we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; You are what you eat. Our body and various chemicals a=\r\nnd hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Meat is high=\r\nly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and ident=\r\nification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all,=\r\n if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, =\r\nthe quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not condu=\r\ncive to spiritual progress.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; It =\r\nis possible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remained full=\r\ny saattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a person. One wanting t=\r\no overcome identification with the body and make spiritual progress, is bet=\r\nter off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc=\r\n with mild spices).\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; If a meat-eating person stops eating meat a=\r\nnd eats cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for protein) for severa=\r\nl months, while trying to read spiritual literature and trying to make spir=\r\nitual progress, one will see that it makes a big difference.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radh=\r\na cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misg=\r\nuided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes =\r\nfrom classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignor=\r\ned.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion ca=\r\nll to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not requir=\r\ne eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; \n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; \n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;     \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personality.
