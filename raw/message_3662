Why should one =\r\nworship Ganesha or Rudra or Chandika or Mahakala.\n&gt; In fact can anybody act=\r\nually worship any deity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. The fact of the matter is that one&#39;s mind=\r\n will be drawn to the worship of deities which one has worshipped in past l=\r\nives.\n&gt; 2. But, whether one will achive or not with that aspect of the divi=\r\nne is based on\n&gt;   a. What is the residue of karmas which one has left? Kar=\r\nana Shareera basically is responsible for this.One in a million\n&gt;       ind=\r\nividuals will achieve the burning of the Karana Shareera. But when this is =\r\nbeing done, then every karma done to that person\n&gt;      to his body or mind=\r\n, good or bad must have an almost hundred times more intensity result, like=\r\n for like.\n&gt;      \n&gt;   b. What is the intensity of the desire of that perso=\r\nn for the Divine Beloved?\n&gt;       Which again boils down to the amount of k=\r\narmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas, the =\r\nlesser the  desire to actually perform any kind of worship.\n&gt;  \n&gt; People ta=\r\nlk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.\n&gt; I find that it simply does n=\r\not matter.\n&gt; Every mantra is a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).\n&gt; S=\r\no, when the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.\n&gt; Where is the rupa for=\r\nming?\n&gt; In the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.\n&gt; So the deity w=\r\nill actually occupy the person.\n&gt; But when can this happen?\n&gt; Only when the=\r\n body is dead. Not dead physically, but in a different sense.\n&gt; ie. ASANA: =\r\nthe mind forgets the body exists after a few hours of sitting really still =\r\nfor a few hours a day.\n&gt;     Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and=\r\n feels it is alive, it tries to still the breath.\n&gt;     Dhyana, the rupa of=\r\n the deity forms in the mind, remember the body is dead for the mind at thi=\r\ns stage.\n&gt;     Dharana: The mind percieves that form of God which is the ob=\r\nject of the consciousness, but duality exists.\n&gt;     Pratyahara: a phenomen=\r\non where the eyes do not see, the ears do not hear.\n&gt;     Samadhi: the rupa=\r\n is so well established, that the ultimate form of that rupa, that mantra, =\r\nthe Nirguna manifests.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So the emptiness must come about in the mind a=\r\nnd body about one&#39;s own identity before God fills it up with His form.\n&gt; So=\r\n, mantra is simply a tool to make us realise God. Anybody can do mantras, b=\r\nut most people&#39;s internal fire or Agni is\n&gt; not really charged up to digest=\r\n these.\n&gt; Japa is no doubt great, but it is involved with the purification =\r\nof air, whereas fire is involved in the purification of internal fire.\n&gt; Wh=\r\nen internal fire is purified, then the ability to visualise your deity beco=\r\nmes stronger. Hence homam in this age is easy and moreover, Agni is a livin=\r\ng God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen by your physical eyes.\n&gt; It moves,=\r\n eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally when it dies, it continues to liv=\r\ne on within the sadhaka.\n&gt; In Kali Yuga, this ability to call a living God =\r\ninto the house is so powerful and so exhalting that later on japa after hom=\r\nam\n&gt; brings very fast results.\n&gt; Why Ganesha? Most people do not want spiri=\r\ntuality, and in any case are not destined to be spiritual in this lifetime,=\r\n so the only way they will pursue some sadhana is if they are given some ma=\r\nterial result quite quickly by their sadhana.\n&gt; Those who have problems in =\r\ncareer, litigation, problems with marriage or in finding life partner, prob=\r\nlems with education or speech can really advance their mundane satisfaction=\r\n with Ganapati homa.\n&gt; I have seen this numerous times myself with people w=\r\nho are in this movement and outside.\n&gt; That is not to say that Ganapati can=\r\n&#39;t give Mukti. The ultimate form of Ganapati is the word of God.\n&gt; And He i=\r\ns sakshama in giving Mukti as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The mahamantras are many and I ag=\r\nree that some may say that lets do this(mahamantras) first.\n&gt; BUT,\n&gt; The Ve=\r\ndic mahamantras require the kind of intonation so perfect with visualisatio=\r\nn at different bits of the body with various syllables, that for most peopl=\r\ne this is not feasible, especially since their Sanskrit itself is somewhat =\r\nimperfect.(remember name is form, if name is not repeated properly then how=\r\n will the form be?)(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati for rakshati=\r\n in Pune many years ago).\n&gt; And then there are mahamantras which are ok wit=\r\nh almost any intonation. If someone wants to follow this that is also ok.\n&gt;=\r\n But, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya. Because, the en=\r\ntrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by Him.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Again some doubt come=\r\ns into people&#39;s heads about some mantras harming them when recited:\n&gt; If so=\r\nmebody experiences bad things when a mantra of a certain deity is recited t=\r\nhen all it means is that the karmas of the Karana shareera are being dealt =\r\nwith(by the deity) quite fast, so they have to be experienced. It actually =\r\nmeans that the Devata is close and more intense sadhana is needed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ac=\r\ntually, all this business about mantra and mahamantra is immaterial, Allah =\r\nmalik Hai, voh sab janta hai.\n&gt; Us parvardigar se prarthana kar, woh sab ra=\r\nste khol deta hai.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
