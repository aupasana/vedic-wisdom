When =\r\nI am doing the ceremony without assistance some of my attention is on keepi=\r\nng the fire going. This distracts me from the reciting the mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; To=\r\nwards the end when I do the 3 pradakshinam, should the attending members of=\r\n the public also do the same?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please guide me.\n&gt; Ranga\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
