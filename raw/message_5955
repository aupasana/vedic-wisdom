It is very very difficult to burn a watery coconut \n&gt; &gt; with j=\r\nust copra. You need wood. You should stick to half/whole dry \n&gt; &gt; coconuts =\r\ninstead of watery coconuts.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I also use the same kind shown b=\r\ny Rajarshi ( http://goo.gl/U7vzW \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://goo.gl/U7vzW&gt; ). Though it is=\r\n possible to offer the green ones ( \n&gt; &gt; http://goo.gl/2LMio &lt;http://goo.gl=\r\n/2LMio&gt; ), it will take a lot more \n&gt; &gt; time (or a much bigger fire) to bur=\r\nn it fully.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I arrange two logs in parallel, separated by an =\r\ninch or so, within my \n&gt; &gt; homa kundam. I place the coconut in the middle, =\r\non top of them. I offer \n&gt; &gt; it at the end of offerings to Ganapathi, kind =\r\nof like a poornaahuti to \n&gt; &gt; Ganapathi (I say &quot;OM gaM gaNapataye namaH, pU=\r\nrNa phalaM samarpayaami&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; i.e. I offer a whole fruit). Then I proceed =\r\nto invoke Chandi in the \n&gt; &gt; fire. By the time Chandi is invoked, the cocon=\r\nut fully cathes fire and \n&gt; &gt; there is a really big fire. Then I start maki=\r\nng offerings with \n&gt; &gt; Chandipath (sesame seeds, ghee etc). The way I arran=\r\nge the two logs, \n&gt; &gt; they touch the firepit walls at the edges of the logs=\r\n only and they do \n&gt; &gt; not touch the bottom surface of the pit that contain=\r\ns burning materials \n&gt; &gt; (e.g. sesame seeds, murmura, nuts, copra pieces et=\r\nc). So, except the \n&gt; &gt; edges, the logs are effectively suspended in air a =\r\nlittle height above \n&gt; &gt; the burning materials. That helps things burn nice=\r\nly, with a big fire. \n&gt; &gt; The coconut also burns fast and with a big fire.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; By the time I am in the middle of the second chapter, the bo=\r\nttom of the \n&gt; &gt; coconut starts to crack. If I keep it a little more time, =\r\nit will break \n&gt; &gt; and coconut water will fall in fire. Before that happens=\r\n, I turn the \n&gt; &gt; coconut around so that the weaker (cracked) side faces up=\r\n. This way, \n&gt; &gt; water spills in fire rarely. Usually most of the water jus=\r\nt evaporates \n&gt; &gt; and only small amounts spill into fire. IF a lot of water=\r\n falls in fire, \n&gt; &gt; just pour some drops of ghee and sprinke sesame seeds =\r\nto increase the \n&gt; &gt; fire again. By the time I finish 13 chapters (sometime=\r\ns even earlier), \n&gt; &gt; the coconut is reduced to ashes. At the end, I offer =\r\na dry coconut as \n&gt; &gt; poornaahuti and meditate peacefully. Dry coconut burn=\r\ns fully by itself, \n&gt; &gt; once it catches fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I experimented=\r\n with various whole fresh fruits, but coconut is the best.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nn general, one simple thumbrule is that materials need oxygen supply to \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; burn well. So, if wood and coconut are exposed to oxygen (air) from as \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; many sides as possible, they will burn well and with a big fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; This is just for giving some ideas to some people who may be doing =\r\nhomam \n&gt; &gt; with a big fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Tw=\r\nitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Mar 15, 2011 at 7:51 AM, vedic=\r\n_pathak wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understood =\r\nwhich coconut you meant. actually i once offered Coconut as \n&gt; &gt; purnahuti =\r\nduring my last visit to India where in My native place, i had \n&gt; &gt; performe=\r\nd a chandi homam with lot of woods.

The coconut would take at \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; leas=\r\nt one and half hours to burn properly. I would use that time to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; me=\r\nditate, while pouring ghee on the coconut at frequent intervals. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; B=\r\nut the coconut will at one point spurt hot water.

That is why it is best if there is some reasonable gap \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; between the person and the homa kunda, like in a fire pit. Prefer \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; large coconuts than smaller ones. Large ones are easier to control \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in fire. Smaller coconuts are more unpredictable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; O=\r\nn a different note, I have had a few occassions when coconuts have \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n burst uncomfortably in the kunda spraying water on me. Once my face \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; got scalded such that I could not shave for a few weeks. However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; the interesting thing is that the bursting of a coconut and water \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; getting sprayed maybe uncomfortable and painful, BUT invariable \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n it=C3=82=C2=A0sublimates some major karma that is coming.

That is another factor \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to be=\r\n taken into account. However, all said and done, it is the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of=\r\nfering one can make in fire. The effects are simply=C3=82=C2=A0amazing.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; If you really want to take your homa experience to the next level, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; try full coconuts.

Traditional=\r\nly this is what was \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; offered as poornaahuti (symbolic of head, i.e.=\r\n ego).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, those who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut =\r\npieces \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; should ignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh =\r\ncoconut \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in fire is practical only for those who do homam with a bi=\r\ng fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; using logs of wood. You want to offer something only if you=\r\n can \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fully burn it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If a fresh coconut is offered in fire,=\r\n it will take a while to burn \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; completely, because it has layers (f=\r\niber, shell, white stuff and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; water etc, just like our own ego-cons=\r\nciousness!). If one offers it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the end of homam, it will be a ch=\r\nallenge to make it burn fully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One idea is to offer it in the begin=\r\nning instead of the end, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; give it time to burn, as one goes thr=\r\nough homam. I, for example, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; offer a fresh coconut in my daily homa=\r\nm at the end of offerings to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ganapathi at the beginning of homam. =\r\nThen I invoke Chandi and offer \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Chandipath in fire with various off=\r\nerings. During the course, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fresh coconut burns fully and gets =\r\nreduced to ashes by the end. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Having offered a whole fresh coconut =\r\nin homam daily for six months, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I can tell you that it is a very go=\r\nod idea (if and only if it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; practical in your case).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One=\r\n risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gush \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a=\r\nt you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; underst=\r\nanding of the dynamics, one should not do this if one is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; worried a=\r\nbout the inhury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
