Sometime=\r\ns the technical aspects (for lack of a better word) have been ignored or no=\r\nt been complied with fully but my main focus has been to do it in the spiri=\r\nt of the document i.e. complete surrender to the deity and with unselfish i=\r\nntent to the best of my ability. That is not to say I have always been succ=\r\nessful but your writings provide me with encouragement and inspiration and =\r\nI have made a concerted effort to get better continually.\n\nHowever, as I ha=\r\nve gotten more comfortable and fluent with the process, I would like to get=\r\n the technical aspects right as well. My sincere belief is that while spiri=\r\nt of performance of the ritual is paramount I should try to get the technic=\r\nal aspects right to the extent that I can control. I do 2 homas a week and =\r\nI reuse the darbhas that are used to &quot;cordon&quot; off the havan kund including =\r\nthe one to draw the 6 lines on the kund. I remove them for cleaning the are=\r\na before sitting for the next homa.\n\nMy questions are \n(a)is it acceptable =\r\nto reuse the darbha grass for the next homa \n(b)it may be acceptable but wh=\r\nat is the correct approach? and \n(c)how to best dispose off darbhas that ha=\r\nve been used.\n\nRegards,\nAlok.\n\n\n"}}
