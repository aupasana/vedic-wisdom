(I am very new to all this.\nSea=\r\nrch for some answers has brought me to this forum.)\n\na) Why Madhukaitam is =\r\n so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being\nsustained by people keeping=\r\n their head down and doing the routine work? Do\nwe not please the God by ke=\r\neping our head down and playing the role assigned\nto us ? An obvious answer=\r\n comes to mind is that it will keep us away from\nemancipation and/self-actu=\r\nalization. Correct/Incorrect?\n\nb) So,  Is spirituality and materialism two =\r\npoles apart (and twain shall\nnever meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heig=\r\nhts of professional success in\nmy career, Am I doomed not to become a good =\r\nspiritualist (???)? or, If I\nwant to become self-actualized by 2025, does i=\r\nt mean I should stop planning\nto climb the professional ladder? I do unders=\r\ntand about &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot;\nissue - but, then I also read about King Jan=\r\nak. Can I combine these two - if\nyes, how?\n\n c) Getting even more confused =\r\nnow,  Why do we say that emancipation is\nour spiritual goal. If GOD created=\r\n us, and put us on this stage - should our\ngoal not be to play the role dut=\r\nifully, which God wants us to play. By\nseeking for emancipation, are we try=\r\ning to get off the stage and trying to\nescape the role assigned to us. Are =\r\nwe not contradicting the God&#39;s scheme of\nthings by trying to get out of the=\r\n scheme?\n\nd) Or, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first =\r\nand then\nask us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he w=\r\nill not be\nplaying &quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??\n\ne) Sometimes, I al=\r\nso think that all these above questions are meaningless. I\nlook at my pre-s=\r\nchool kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher.\nShe is not worr=\r\nying about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly,\nprobably, Ema=\r\nncipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should\nnot be thin=\r\nking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to\nlearn/experien=\r\nce more till we are ready (for what?)\n\nf) Then, what do we mean by spiritua=\r\nl journey? where/how do we start? I\nthought about doing homam/reciting mant=\r\nra - but is that the right way? or\nthere is another way. Probably, there ar=\r\ne many ways - then how do I choose\nmy way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or &quot; spiritualit=\r\ny for dummies&quot; book  would have been\nuseful. Do we have one?\n\nI will apprec=\r\niate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact,\nprobably, I d=\r\nonot even have the right question right now - forget about\narticulating the=\r\nm well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))\n\n\nRegards\n\nSanj=\r\nay\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

As per Narayana sooktam, all gods (including =\r\nBrahma, Vishnu, Shiva,\n&gt; Indra etc) came from Narayana. As per Ganapathi At=\r\nharva seersham, all gods\n&gt; (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) cam=\r\ne from Ganapathi. As per\n&gt; Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including =\r\nBrahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra\n&gt; etc) came from Ganapathi. As per Suryopanish=\r\nat, all gods (including Brahma,\n&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Surya=\r\n. And so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; The duality is so vast and yet non-duality is the underlyi=\r\nng supreme\n&gt; reality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy within hierarchy will =\r\nhave to start\n&gt; at the connection with non-duality and it is not one. In ot=\r\nher words, any\n&gt; hierarchy given by anyone is with respect to one perspecti=\r\nve. I will not be\n&gt; too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, because that cann=\r\not be done really. If\n&gt; you haven&#39;t before, do read the analogy in the last=\r\n part of the mail\n&gt; mentioned above. It is an analogy worth getting into yo=\r\nur thinking system.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mean is it the Rishi wh=\r\no is acting our the Mother&#39;s instructions\n&gt; &gt; or is it She who is creating =\r\nthe environment for the Rishi&#39;s wish\n&gt; &gt; to come true? Which one came first=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no causal relationship between the two. Actions of rishis an=\r\nd the\n&gt; will of the supreme cosmic being are in sync. They just happen toge=\r\nther.\n&gt; Neither causes the other.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rishis are the most perfected beings =\r\nwithout a trace of ego and yet\n&gt; performing actions of great consequence, w=\r\nith zero attachment. They operate\n&gt; right on the border of duality and non-=\r\nduality.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; As a devotee it is natural and simp=\r\nle to believe that the God I\n&gt; &gt; pray to is the Ultimate Supreme authority,=\r\n but when I hear that\n&gt; &gt; Rishis are even beyond this, then doubt creeps in=\r\n, is the deity\n&gt; &gt; therefore not as supreme as is made out to be?\n&gt;\n&gt; Our e=\r\ngo does not leave us even in sadhana. Sometimes, one&#39;s belief that\n&gt; one&#39;s =\r\nguru is the best guru or the god one prays to is the supreme one is\n&gt; roote=\r\nd in one&#39;e ego and one&#39;s need to be the best and be associated with the\n&gt; b=\r\nest. Just contemplate if that is the case and if it is, try to root out\n&gt; s=\r\nuch thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; Having said that, do look at the god you pray to as the s=\r\nupreme and try to\n&gt; reach the supreme through him/her by surrendering to hi=\r\nm/her. If you take a\n&gt; low level manifestation of that deity, then rishis m=\r\nay indeed be beyond\n&gt; him/her as Vimalananda said. But, if you take the hig=\r\nhest manifestation of\n&gt; the deity, as the supreme cosmic being, then rishis=\r\n are his playmates and\n&gt; neither above nor below.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; If you take a company, there may be a chairman who may be the highest\n&gt; =\r\nauthority. But, it may be a ceremonial role and some may consider CEO to be=\r\n\n&gt; higher while some may consider the chairman to be higher. Why bother abo=\r\nut\n&gt; who is higher? In a company does well, they both work with understandi=\r\nng.\n&gt;\n&gt; The hierarchy is irrelevant to one who is a clerk at the company.

Also, he need not be talking about somebody=\r\n &quot;connected to&quot; his\n&gt; ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, th=\r\nere are connections\n&gt; between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the=\r\n house of Sister\n&gt; Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and=\r\n knew her well when\n&gt; he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his pr=\r\nison cell of Swami\n&gt; Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, in whic=\r\nh he imparted\n&gt; Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up=\r\n in Calcutta and\n&gt; learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna =\r\nand wrote the gospel\n&gt; of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher=\r\n to Ramakrishna to\n&gt; expand his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahas=\r\nhaya and admired him.\n&gt; And so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Coming back to the main point, the s=\r\nupermind established in the field of\n&gt; earth that was referred to by Aurobi=\r\nndo can simply be a maharshi paying some\n&gt; attention to matters on earth. A=\r\n maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of\n&gt; the higher planes of conscious=\r\nness can accomplish huge changes on earth by\n&gt; the mere power of his though=\r\nt. If there is a divine play to make some\n&gt; positive changes on earth and a=\r\n maharshi takes part in the play, he may\n&gt; focus a small part of his superm=\r\nind on the affairs of earth and direct a few\n&gt; important souls to do some k=\r\ney work. Some important souls (deities, rishis\n&gt; or yogis etc) may send the=\r\nir amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to\n&gt; fulfil different parts=\r\n of a divine play.\n&gt;\n&gt; You may then see several (not just one) elevated bei=\r\nngs, enlightened beings\n&gt; and realized beings born on earth to bring clarit=\r\ny in different aspects of\n&gt; spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get spec=\r\nific internal/external\n&gt; guidance from the divine, based on what their part=\r\n in the play is.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;  The &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that=\r\n Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At\n&gt; the subtlest level, he manifes=\r\nts as false ego in pretty much everybody. At\n&gt; the grossest level, he manif=\r\nests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; One should not tolerate thi=\r\ns Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one\n&gt; should not *hate* this Asura=\r\n or those afflicted by him. When we encounter\n&gt; lies, we should fight and s=\r\ntand for truth but not hate the liar at the same\n&gt; time. There is nothing t=\r\nhat needs to be hated in this world. One should\n&gt; learn to do the job assig=\r\nned to one by Nature without attraction or\n&gt; repulsion to anything or anybo=\r\ndy and with unconditional love (i.e. no\n&gt; expectations of a return) to all.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\nys about changes coming in the world.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know very little. But I was tol=\r\nd that an age that is somewhat like the\n&gt; bygone ages will be established o=\r\nn earth for a few hundred years in the\n&gt; coming decades. The reason the Div=\r\nine Mother appeared before Manish and\n&gt; asked him to spread simple homam pr=\r\nocedures in the world was to prepare the\n&gt; grounds for that.

I am\n&gt; posting it =\r\nhere for anyone interested.\n&gt;\n&gt; Near the beginning of the 20th century the =\r\ngreat Indian freedom fighter and\n&gt; yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to expre=\r\nss a truth which had not been\n&gt; expressed before. In his high states of div=\r\nine union he saw that the time\n&gt; had come for a new stage in the evolution =\r\nof mankind. He saw that the divine\n&gt; was to manifest right here on Earth an=\r\nd that the time for this divine\n&gt; emergence into Earth life was now. He spo=\r\nke of heaven descending to Earth,\n&gt; even as Earth experienced a breakdown d=\r\nue to the intrinsic resistance held\n&gt; within her material body towards this=\r\n =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondi=\r\ncherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra\n&gt; Alfassa, who later became known =\r\nas the Mother. Together they embarked on a\n&gt; journey of intensive cellular =\r\ntransformation that is very relevant to the\n&gt; colossal uncertainties we fac=\r\ne today.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates al=\r\nl matter, and that all\n&gt; matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The=\r\n process of the divine\n&gt; spirit descending down into matter is called invol=\r\nution. The process by\n&gt; which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter=\r\n is called evolution.\n&gt; According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a =\r\nstage where these two\n&gt; events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inn=\r\ner visions, he foresaw\n&gt; that we would soon be experiencing a descent of wh=\r\nat he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental\n&gt; (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD tha=\r\nt would entirely change everything on Earth.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Man=EF=BF=BDs gr=\r\neatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he\n&gt; makes po=\r\nssible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom\n&gt; active i=\r\nn most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if\n&gt; obstructe=\r\nd from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality.\n&gt; There is a=\r\n great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer\n&gt; senses se=\r\nems to contradict it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going =\r\nthrough an evolutionary\n&gt; crisis. A stage has been reached in which the hum=\r\nan mind has made tremendous\n&gt; strides on the one hand, but is left hopeless=\r\nly inadequate to prevent its\n&gt; own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as t=\r\nhe Mother testified before her\n&gt; death in 1973, a consciousness higher than=\r\n the human rational mind, what may\n&gt; be termed the Supermind, has recently =\r\nbeen established in the fields of the\n&gt; Earth, and is active there. Our tas=\r\nk now is to bring it down into cellular\n&gt; consciousness.\n&gt; Evolution took a=\r\n great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later\n&gt; with the emergenc=\r\ne of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap\n&gt; forward, even more=\r\n momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the\n&gt; Supermind. Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which\n&gt; we will soon be sta=\r\nrting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is\n&gt; =EF=BF=BDanimal=\r\n human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an\n&gt; indi=\r\nvidualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with\n&gt; =\r\nit.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that=\r\n is spontaneous- ly coming to\n&gt; birth under the influence of an ever-expand=\r\ning supramental field, a being\n&gt; that is largely able to merge and live fro=\r\nm soul-consciousness rather than\n&gt; mind-consciousness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thirdly is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, bu=\r\nt\n&gt; will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental\n&gt; cons=\r\nciousness that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally,=\r\n our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD=\r\n\n&gt; divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will =\r\nbe a\n&gt; race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In t=\r\nhis species, the unity\n&gt; of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon =\r\nEarth.\n&gt; The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing sup=\r\nramental\n&gt; consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own =\r\nbodies.\n&gt; Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supram=\r\nental\n&gt; consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousne=\r\nss fields\n&gt; of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its=\r\n full\n&gt; manifestation in collective matter.\n&gt; Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BD=\r\ndescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri\n&gt; Aurobindo and the=\r\n Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD\n&gt;=\r\n essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the\n&gt;=\r\n Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the=\r\n\n&gt; Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and=\r\n\n&gt; which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them =\r\nthe\n&gt; Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recent=\r\nly, and\n&gt; the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the la=\r\ntter two\n&gt; still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke =\r\nof the Asura\n&gt; of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler dur=\r\ning World War II, and of their\n&gt; own intensive inner work in countering his=\r\n influence. It would not be\n&gt; difficult to see how this same Asura may be i=\r\nnfluencing other world leaders\n&gt; in the current political sphere.\n&gt; With th=\r\ne descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete\n&gt; human =\r\nstructures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that\n&gt; alt=\r\nhough the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily\n&gt; catastro=\r\nphic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our\n&gt; world fo=\r\nr the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he\n&gt; maintaine=\r\nd, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this\n&gt; resistance =\r\nby means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras\n&gt; will event=\r\nually be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life,\n&gt; Beauty, =\r\nand Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence\n&gt; in t=\r\nhe world today, the destruction we might have experienced if not for\n&gt; this=\r\n power of harmonization!\n&gt; *When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and th=\r\ne Mother believed that the\n&gt; world stage was set for this quantum descent, =\r\nand that it was quite\n&gt; imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramen=\r\ntal transformation was a\n&gt; certainty now, and that it would come about with=\r\n a minimum of destruction,\n&gt; =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still consid=\r\nerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000\n&gt; would be a turning point.*\n&gt;=\r\n **\n&gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says ab=\r\nout\n&gt; changes coming in the world.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; * The upsur=\r\nge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd14b0281acda046d156a35\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Very good article/discuss=\r\nion..Thanks for sharing it.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;If I can, Let me a=\r\nlso ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all this. Search for some a=\r\nnswers has brought me to this forum.) &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;a) Why =\r\nMadhukaitam is =C2=A0so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being sustain=\r\ned by people keeping their head down and doing the routine work? Do we not =\r\nplease the God by keeping our head down and playing the role assigned to us=\r\n ? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep us away from emanci=\r\npation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;b) So,=C2=A0 Is spirituality and materialism two poles apart (and twa=\r\nin shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of professional =\r\nsuccess in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good spiritualist (???)? =\r\nor, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop=\r\n planning to climb the professional ladder? I do understand about &quot;Lim=\r\nited Bandwidth&quot; issue - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can I =\r\ncombine these two - if yes, how?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;c) Get=\r\nting even more confused now,=C2=A0 Why do we say that emancipation is our=\r\n=C2=A0spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage - should =\r\nour goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us to play. By =\r\nseeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off the stage and trying to =\r\nescape the role assigned to us. Are we not contradicting the God&#39;s sche=\r\nme of things by trying to get out of the scheme? &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;d) Or, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quo=\r\nt; first and then ask us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do=\r\n so? I am sure he will not be playing=C2=A0&quot;rats in the maze&quot; gam=\r\ne. Then, why??&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;e) Sometimes, I also think tha=\r\nt all these above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-school kid an=\r\nd the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying about h=\r\ner profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably,=C2=A0Emancipati=\r\non/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thinking at=\r\n the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience more=\r\n till we are ready (for what?)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;f) Then, what =\r\ndo we mean by spiritual journey? where/how do we start? I thought about doi=\r\nng homam/reciting mantra - but is that the right way? or there is another w=\r\nay. Probably, there are many ways - then how do I choose my way? An &quot;u=\r\nser guide&quot; or &quot; spirituality for dummies&quot; book=C2=A0 would h=\r\nave been useful. Do we have one?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I will appre=\r\nciate if you can take some time out to guide me here. In fact, probably, I =\r\ndonot even have the right question right now - forget about articulating th=\r\nem well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the problem :))&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Sa=\r\nnjay&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;On Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM, Narasimha=\r\n P.V.R.

Thus, the hierar=\r\nchy within hierarchy will have to start at the connection with non-duality =\r\nand it is not one. In other words, any hierarchy given by anyone is with re=\r\nspect to one perspective. I will not be too keen on finalizing one hierarch=\r\ny, because that cannot be done really.

Also, he need no=\r\nt be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, =\r\nwhen it comes to great lineages, there are connections between all.

He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just=C2=A0a fe=\r\nw years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge.=\r\n Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who =\r\nwas a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga S=\r\nwami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga=\r\n Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him.

In his high states of divine =\r\nunion he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of man=\r\nkind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that t=\r\nhe time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heav=\r\nen descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the in=\r\ntrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdesc=\r\nent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, Ind=\r\nia, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother=\r\n. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation =\r\nthat is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=\r\n=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and=\r\n that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of the=\r\n divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The proces=\r\ns by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolutio=\r\nn. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these two=\r\n events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw =\r\nthat we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsup=\r\nramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change eve=\r\nrything on Earth.&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what h=\r\ne is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul i=\r\ns somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eter=\r\nnal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid=\r\n of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, ev=\r\nen if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutio=\r\nnary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made trem=\r\nendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to preven=\r\nt its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified befor=\r\ne her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, w=\r\nhat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the field=\r\ns of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into =\r\ncellular consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Evolution took a great leap forward=\r\n with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now=\r\n at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepa=\r\nre for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stag=\r\nes of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurr=\r\nently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current =\r\nspecies, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely ob=\r\nstructed from contacting and merging with it.&lt;br&gt;\n=EF=BF=BD&lt;br&gt;Next is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =\r\nbirth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=\r\nhat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=\r\nind-consciousness. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inh=\r\nabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light,=\r\n which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular c=\r\nonsciousness. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental=\r\n Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matt=\r\ner. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=\r\n=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully re=\r\nalized upon Earth.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the =\r\nMother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular con=\r\nsciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this=\r\n meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought =\r\ninto the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it wou=\r\nld flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.&lt;br&gt;\nWhenever th=\r\nere is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri A=\r\nurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAs=\r\nuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. =\r\nThere is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falseh=\r\nood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly app=\r\narent, and which seem to be in control of current global events. According =\r\nto them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation =\r\nrecently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only th=\r\ne latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spok=\r\ne of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler dur=\r\ning World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his i=\r\nnfluence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influ=\r\nencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete =\r\nhuman structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that=\r\n although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catast=\r\nrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world fo=\r\nr the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained,=\r\n carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by m=\r\neans other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually =\r\nbe absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Trut=\r\nh. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world t=\r\noday, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of ha=\r\nrmonization!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo an=\r\nd the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent=\r\n, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramen=\r\ntal transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a=\r\n minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerab=\r\nle.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;This was a very interesting read and match=\r\nes what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: na=\r\nvy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Courier&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;=\r\n3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/font=\r\n&gt; &lt;/font&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;=\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; COLOR: white&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd14b0281acda046d156a35--\r\n\n"}}
