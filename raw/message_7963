In the beginning, I intend to do it every=\r\n Saturday. I will start with the MahaGanapathy homam, and then let MahaGana=\r\npathy guide me along the path, as you have said many times. Shrimaan, I was=\r\n thinking of starting from the beginning of the New Year in Chaitra Masa, w=\r\nhich happens on March 23rd this year. The very auspicious Vasant/Chaitra Na=\r\nvaratri also starts the same day. I was thinking of starting from either Ch=\r\naitra Pratipada - March 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya -March 24th, Sh=\r\nanivara. Do you reckon this to be a good time to start the homam? and which=\r\n is a better day - Chaitra Pratipada, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya, Shaniv=\r\nara? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I look forward to your guidance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks and best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
