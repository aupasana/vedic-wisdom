We=\r\n are losing our youth because they don&#39;t want to be like us. We have been w=\r\neak; we have been ashamed; we have been reactionary instead of proactive. A=\r\ns a result, we have lost our youth&#39;s respect. \n\nTo regain our children&#39;s re=\r\nspect, let us become the examples of Hindu strength, Hindu courage, Hindu c=\r\nonviction, Hindu intelligence, Hindu pride, and Hindu assertiveness that ou=\r\nr children so yearn for us to be. Let us stand with dignity and pride, and =\r\nnot be afraid to proclaim to the world: &#39;I am a follower of Sanatana Dharma=\r\n, the Eternal Natural Way, and a servant of the almighty Bhagavan (God)! Me=\r\nin Hindu Hun!!&#39;\n\nAnd if we Hindus can learn to stand courageously in the fa=\r\nce of our many opponents, and serve as examples of strength to our children=\r\n, I guarantee that our youth will follow our example =96 and more, they wil=\r\nl far surpass it.\n\nLong have we bemoaned the Americanization of Hindu youth=\r\n. My prediction, however, is that in America, we will soon witness a verita=\r\nble army of these very same Americanized, savvy, cool, energized and very p=\r\nractically-minded Hindu youth coming back to Sanatana Dharma. And when they=\r\n do, they will be the vanguard of a new and truly American Hinduism that wi=\r\nll instantiate the very best of both worlds =96 bringing together the very =\r\nbest of the most ancient with the very best of the most cutting-edge.\n\nLike=\r\n two wings of the same powerful eagle, Sanatana Dharma and the very best as=\r\npects of American culture must be coupled together in partnership if either=\r\n is going to have a meaningful future. If this can happen, not only will Sa=\r\nnatana Dharma have a future in America - Sanatana Dharma will be America&#39;s =\r\nfuture!....&quot;\n\n\nVISIT HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS ENLIVENING ARTICLE:\n\nhtt=\r\np://www.dharmacentral.com/forum/content.php?38-Hinduism-Future-America\n\n\nPl=\r\nease forward this important information to all sincere spiritual seekers.
