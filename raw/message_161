A mantra can make the\nimposs=\r\nible things possible. A simple sadkak can become a great saint\nwith the pow=\r\ner of mantra. A mantra can change an unfavourable situation\ninto a favourab=\r\nle one.\n\nThere are three types of mantras.\n\n    * Sabhri Mantra:- These man=\r\ntras empowers the sadhak with siddhi or\nmystic powers.\n    * Tantrik Mantra=\r\n:- These mantras empowers the sadhak ckamatkarik\npowers (amazing demonstrat=\r\nive powers) at the mystic level.\n    * Vedic Mantra :- Vedic mantra which g=\r\noes towards achieving eternal\npeace for the soul.\n\nThis mantra once given b=\r\ny a guru can erase fear within oneself\nimmediately. Mantras have amazing an=\r\nd unbelievable power. Once I read a\nbook that there was a saint  Mahamalesh=\r\nwar if somebody touched his body\nhe could hear Rama Naam jap automatically.=\r\n Mahaprabhu Chaitanya chanted\nnaam kirtun trees began to sway as if in danc=\r\ne to his sacred tune. So\nMantras have amazing and unbelievable powers. Ever=\r\ny Sadhak will convey\nyou a different experiences and stories. Mantras are s=\r\no powerful because\nit is a pure sound and it invokes every nerve of you bod=\r\ny and creates an\ninvisible ring outside your body.\n\nMany people do not beli=\r\neve that these small mantras have so much power.\nIt is because they are ill=\r\niterate in this filed and they are in\ndarkness.\n\nYou know when one a small =\r\nmass is converted to energy it creates too\nmuch energy and Atom Bombs are m=\r\nade on this theory.\n\n235 92 U + 1 0 n ----------&gt;139 56Ba + 94 36 Kr +3 1 0=\r\nn + Large amount\nof energy\n\nNuclear power plant are working on this theory.=\r\n 1 gram of uranium-235 is\nsubjected to fission creates 8.36 x 107 kilojoule=\r\ns of energy. It is\npossible because Uranium is not a simple metal but has t=\r\noo much hidden\nenergy.\n\nIn the similar way these Mantras are not simple wor=\r\nds but they are\nspecial words like Uranium, Thorium, Plutonium they have gr=\r\neat hidden\nenergy and when triggered by a Sadhak it produces unlimited ener=\r\ngy\nwithin you. You can utilise the energy produced by Mantra Chanting.\n\nThe=\r\nre are three mantras written at the top of this article and you may\nstart a=\r\nnyone of these mantras and recite them daily one mala. You will\nhave some s=\r\npecial feeling withing 40 days.\n\nYou can feel the energy just go on and tri=\r\ngger one Mantra of your need\nor choice.
