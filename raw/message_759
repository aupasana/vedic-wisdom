To exchange our ideas and=\r\n experiences is really exciting sometime. There was a time when I was doing=\r\n Gayatri Mantra constantly. Now I am doing only Thakur&#39;s Dixa mantra and af=\r\nter reading your articles I have again started Chandi Path daily. We really=\r\n experience some sort of energy within us. \nI will narrate one of my experi=\r\nences. In 1976/77 I was=C2=A0reciting Chandi Path daily before Shri Thakur&#39;=\r\ns Photo kept in the Pooja (worship)cupboard. I was closing that cupboard af=\r\nter worshipping. At that time I was living in=C2=A0a single=C2=A0room only =\r\nas I was newly transferred from Dwarka to Ahmedabad. One day one lady of 35=\r\n came to me to show her horoscope. She was Gujarati but was living in USA. =\r\nAfter some discussion on astrology she suddenly went to trance and started =\r\nsaying me that &quot;I hear Mantras of Chandi Path from that corner. I see some =\r\nwhite blue rays are coming from that cupboard.&quot; I was surprised to hear the=\r\nse words as my Pooja Cupboard was closed and she was not knowing that I was=\r\n doing daily Chandi Path=C2=A0in that corner. She was also reading Auras an=\r\nd said to me that=C2=A0&#39;I am seeing Purple and Blue coloured Aura coming fr=\r\nom your body.&#39;\nI asked her how you got this knowledge? She said that she wa=\r\ns chanting &#39;=C2=A0Om Gam Ganapataye Namah&#39;=C2=A0 Mantra constantly from her=\r\n=C2=A0childhood. \nThis experience made my faith towards Chandi Path more st=\r\nrong. \nDr.Ashwin Rawal\n\n--- On Sun, 14/12/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

Even if =\r\nthere is some movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that is enoug=\r\nh. That is enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical vibration of air). =\r\nWhen you rely on an external fire, the physical vibration of air (sound) fo=\r\nrms a connection between you and fire. You use that fire then to create pow=\r\nerful subtle vibrations, far more powerful than what you can generate.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\nWhen doing japam, internal chanting without lips or vocal cords having=\r\n any movement is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better that way. When=\r\n relying on the internal fire alone, physical vibration of sound is not nee=\r\nded and avoiding it can help focus the energy and generate stronger subtle =\r\nvibrations.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nYou were earlier asking about sk=\r\nipping some things vs doing everything fully, in Chandipath. An interesting=\r\n experience happened in my daily Chandi homam in the very morning after I r=\r\neplied to you. I think it was a Chaturdasi morning. I finished the homam an=\r\nd was about to offer poornaahuti. There are a few Vedic mantras that I norm=\r\nally read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning very bright. I closed my=\r\n eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to chant the mantras. Bu=\r\nt suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mother was standing in fron=\r\nt of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It felt very strongly like s=\r\nhe was saying &quot;enough with those mantras. They do not matter now. Just give=\r\n me the poornaahuti, NOW.&quot; I did not think much. I surrendered fully to Her=\r\n as manifested in my mind. It may just be the imagination of a fool, but I =\r\nsurrendered to Her as She existed in my mind at that time. I left the stand=\r\nard mantras and just said &quot;om aim\n hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche vausha=\r\nt&quot; and offered the dry coconut in fire with eyes closed still. With eyes cl=\r\nosed still, I went into meditation immediately.

However, Manish=\r\n did not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at tha=\r\nt time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I shoul=\r\nd teach a simple procedure to him.\n\nI experimented with homam, started doin=\r\ng occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. Af=\r\nter doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original tas=\r\nk - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. =\r\nIn hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Nara=\r\nyan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have=\r\n benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, all th=\r\nis started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, =\r\nmany people across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..\n\n* *=\r\n *\n\nIt was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset i=\r\ntself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would&#39;v=\r\ne been different while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic=\r\n and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Nara=\r\nyan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it=\r\n down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattw=\r\nik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story,=\r\n it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would not ha=\r\nve had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam=\r\n to Narayan.\n\nManish told me the full story only when I was better prepared=\r\n to handle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the=\r\n manual as asked by him then.\n\n* * *\n\nA good guru protects a sishya from un=\r\nnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another=\r\n incident.\n\nOne day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a wh=\r\nole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspi=\r\nration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told =\r\nManish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I started before sunrise a=\r\nnd went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at =\r\nnoon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath a=\r\nt dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayat=\r\nri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the=\r\n end of the day.\n\nI noticed on the next day that the previous day was Aksha=\r\nya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very auspicious d=\r\nay and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more=\r\n powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked =\r\na perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Mani=\r\nsh with excitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itse=\r\nlf. But I did not tell you because knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You =\r\nwould have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that e=\r\nxcitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the=\r\n sadhana.&quot;\n\nHe was absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a=\r\n sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on t=\r\nhe mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, =\r\nit would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement, brought in rajas and reduce=\r\nd the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Eve=\r\nn after one makes excellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one d=\r\nown! After hearing Manish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was=\r\n still alive and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more deli=\r\ncious food!\n\nLucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them wh=\r\nat is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru =\r\n(or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out=\r\n, so that they can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it =\r\nthrough conscious effort.\n\n* * *\n\nI remember one more similar incident. Bef=\r\nore the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me=\r\n to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentione=\r\nd the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and t=\r\nhat I would do some important work in this birth.\n\nWhen I saw Manish later =\r\nthat day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said &quot;=\r\nNarasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with t=\r\nhe identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologe=\r\nr&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It wi=\r\nll take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if=\r\n that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new ident=\r\nity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. B=\r\nut it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identitie=\r\ns.&quot;\n\nHow true and wise!\n\n* * *\n\nJust as a fat and mighty dog may win over a=\r\n lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego =\r\nor the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets =\r\nall the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and fe=\r\ned the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and =\r\nincrease detachment.\n\nManish has a unique way of looking at things and some=\r\n simple points he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up m=\r\ny spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra=\r\n to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my he=\r\nart. He would say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped=\r\n the dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru=\r\n does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on =\r\nthe glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Som=\r\netimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n\n* * *\n\nHom=\r\nam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also =\r\ntry to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is =\r\nno magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or =\r\nday or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one sh=\r\nould start walking on the path and not worry about the progress and the dis=\r\ntance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.=\r\n\n\nThe point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) a=\r\nnd the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. =\r\nAfter a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start to wo=\r\nrk together very effectively.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast.=\r\n net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;na=\r\nrayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything similar to it), it\n&gt; h=\r\nappens with all beginners and its only practice which makes one\n&gt; perfect. =\r\nMost of us assume that this is only applicable in mundane\n&gt; matters.

Imagine!=\r\n!! In Kaliyuga, along with\n&gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the=\r\n best path for most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spir=\r\nitual Guru whom I also\n&gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chenna=\r\ni for Shata Chandi\n&gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was re=\r\nally joking!\n&gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded m=\r\ne. It then\n&gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started searc=\r\nhing on\n&gt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I =\r\ntook\n&gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then\n&gt; re=\r\nminded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely\n&gt; in S=\r\namskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between\n&gt; an instr=\r\nuction and sloka :).

I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which he\n&gt; did, but still it did=\r\n not get through my really dense brains :). I\n&gt; felt really helpless, but t=\r\nhe stars were such that I never gave up,\n&gt; instead I made a sincere prayer =\r\nto Lord Ganesha, that If he really\n&gt; intends that I perform the homa, then =\r\nhe should kindly show me the\n&gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha tol=\r\nd me that he has decided\n&gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the ho=\r\nma. I just couldnt\n&gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipo=\r\ntent for his\n&gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it t=\r\naking\n&gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thank Manishji, Nar=\r\nasimha and the all the divine forces for helping\n&gt; me progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; My req=\r\nuest, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We\n&gt; are humans =\r\nand prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very\n&gt; first time, u=\r\nnless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.\n&gt; Its all a continuu=\r\nm. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...\n&gt; plenty of time. These =\r\nthings take their own sweet time, doesnt happen\n&gt; overnight. No matter what=\r\n, complete your homa everyday, that should be\n&gt; the primary goal ... nothin=\r\ng else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you\n&gt; get or dont get anything. Slo=\r\nwly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and\n&gt; move on to higher things. I wish al=\r\nl the best. We should really thank\n&gt; our stars that people like Manishji an=\r\nd Narasimhaji are here guiding\n&gt; us ... what would be life without them!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; -Narayan-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; N=\r\namaste Garu !!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the =\r\nbank and cashing it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 chec=\r\nk to the bank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your fav=\r\norite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply =\r\nserves the master. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other ac=\r\ntivities are your way to serve your \n&gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlo=\r\nrd may be very wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; everyday to cash and a=\r\nlso many big checks everyday to mail others. \n&gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servan=\r\nt to physically carry papers to the bank and \n&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly=\r\n, god is capable of doing anything in this \n&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs hum=\r\nan beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this \n&gt; &gt; world. That is why various =\r\ngods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to=\r\n earth every now and then. The \n&gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates thro=\r\nugh various physical persons \n&gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homa=\r\nm and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try \n&gt; &gt; to help others=\r\n, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries \n&gt; &gt; master&#39;s paper=\r\ns to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applaude=\r\nd by others as good work tends to promote ego \n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard aga=\r\ninst it. A servant carrying a million dollar \n&gt; &gt; check to the bank and cas=\r\nhing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank=\r\n and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not =\r\nown anything. Both are just \n&gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry =\r\nout his agenda. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deed=\r\ns in this world and one \n&gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in t=\r\nhis world are both \n&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in=\r\n this world. \n&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself su=\r\nperior to \n&gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by t=\r\nhe world, \n&gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something less \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nvaluable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully pen=\r\netrates one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter =\r\nwhat \n&gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in lig=\r\nht \n&gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadh=\r\nana like homam. It is a job \n&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you=\r\n can. But you own nothing. \n&gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedi=\r\nc- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast=\r\n. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12=\r\n:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reading your response another questi=\r\non came into my mind. \n&gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not good if fire is=\r\n extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not=\r\n good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or \n&gt; &gt; the fact that the fi=\r\nre is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean actyually i feel when someo=\r\nne starts doing homa \n&gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa a=\r\ngni gets \n&gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me cou=\r\nple of \n&gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one m=\r\nember \n&gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me, i relight the fire and keep \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva=\r\n Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4=\r\n December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a =\r\nhomam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; u=\r\nsed instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a r=\r\nooftop. Doing it in the open is \n&gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in close=\r\nd space. But realize that a \n&gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella =\r\naround to protect the fire \n&gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It i=\r\ns not good if fire is \n&gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nat the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While perfo=\r\nrming the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mental=\r\nly while listening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listenin=\r\ng to mantras with all the attention \n&gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying m=\r\nantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\ny a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; control =\r\nover the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Howe=\r\nver, there is a difference between meditation and \n&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is sub=\r\nmitted in the internal fire in meditation and it \n&gt; &gt; is submitted in the e=\r\nxternal fire as well in a homam. So making some \n&gt; &gt; external sound (even i=\r\nf feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent \n&gt; &gt; chanting or just listeni=\r\nng. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati H=\r\nomam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apa=\r\nrt from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam =\r\n(sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or mar=\r\nried is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas se=\r\nt by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow the=\r\nm \n&gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; r=\r\necommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; homam for sp=\r\niritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and \n&gt; &gt; allow them t=\r\no do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru \n&gt; &gt; and perform =\r\nhomam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the \n&gt; &gt; process until=\r\n the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n&gt; &gt; through homam an=\r\nd other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantro=\r\npadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n&gt; &gt; after a while, when the =\r\nperson crosses a threshhold of purity. The \n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and othe=\r\nr mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up \n&gt; &gt; and make the person cross t=\r\nhe threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one desires no specific ma=\r\nterial benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does hom=\r\nam for spiritual \n&gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some=\r\n suffering for \n&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? =\r\nor any day would be \n&gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the be=\r\nst is a Chaturthi morning. \n&gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Man=\r\nish \n&gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We en=\r\nded \n&gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were)=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; serious=\r\nly. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; &gt; rooftop of t=\r\nhe apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Naras=\r\nimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after \n&gt; &gt; our homam finishe=\r\ns&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our =\r\nhomas \n&gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started rain=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthen packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\n New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered \n&gt; &gt; the n=\r\north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went \n&gt; &gt; to, as =\r\nwe finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. \n&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;=\r\nitsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am i=\r\nnterested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \n&gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof =\r\ntop of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ?

I closed my eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my =\r\nhead and started to chant the mantras. But suddenly I got this palpable fee=\r\nling that the Mother was standing in front of me in the fire and asking me =\r\nto hurry up. It felt very strongly like she was saying &quot;enough with those m=\r\nantras. They do not matter now. Just give me the poornaahuti, NOW.&quot; I did n=\r\not think much. I surrendered fully to Her as manifested in my mind. It may =\r\njust be the imagination of a fool, but I surrendered to Her as She existed =\r\nin my mind at that time. I left the standard mantras and just said &quot;om\n aim=\r\n hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche vaushat&quot; and offered the dry coconut in =\r\nfire with eyes closed still. With eyes closed still, I went into meditation=\r\n immediately.

However, Manish di=\r\nd not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that t=\r\nime was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should t=\r\neach a simple procedure to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I experimented with homam, started d=\r\noing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday.=\r\n After doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original =\r\ntask - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpos=\r\ne. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to N=\r\narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people h=\r\nave benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my\n mind concerned, al=\r\nl this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing hom=\r\nam, many people across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell m=\r\ne at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and ment=\r\nal state would&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve be=\r\nen more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told w=\r\nas to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance a=\r\nnd also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up b=\r\neing more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known=\r\n the full story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then an=\r\nd I would not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing mysel=\r\nf to teach homam to Narayan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish told me the full story only when=\r\n I was better prepared to handle the information\n and, of course, I added i=\r\nt to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A =\r\ngood guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak hav=\r\noc with the ego. I remember another incident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One day in the spring =\r\nof the same year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri ma=\r\nntra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I i=\r\nmmediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahe=\r\nad and do it&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except fo=\r\nr 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch an=\r\nd another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in=\r\n the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good expe=\r\nrience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I noticed =\r\non the next day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla =\r\nTriteeya). It is considered a very\n auspicious day and it is believed that =\r\nspiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other day=\r\ns. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadha=\r\nna. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few da=\r\nys later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you =\r\nbecause knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been excited at =\r\ndoing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed =\r\nthe mental focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was ab=\r\nsolutely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and=\r\n pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was a=\r\nware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased=\r\n the pride and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus =\r\non mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes exc=\r\nellent progress, it can\n suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing M=\r\nanish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kic=\r\nking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;L=\r\nucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful r=\r\nather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone el=\r\nse) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they=\r\n can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it through consci=\r\nous effort.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I remember one more similar incident. Befor=\r\ne the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me t=\r\no a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned =\r\nthe name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and tha=\r\nt I would do some important work in this birth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I saw Manish la=\r\nter that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and sa=\r\nid &quot;Narasimha, do\n you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong w=\r\nith the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astr=\r\nologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. =\r\nIt will take great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. =\r\nAs if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new =\r\nidentity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be corre=\r\nct. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all iden=\r\ntities.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How true and wise!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as a fat and mi=\r\nghty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the=\r\n master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit =\r\nof detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may c=\r\nhain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously t=\r\nry to restrain ego and increase detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish has a unique way =\r\nof looking\n at things and some simple points he made brought so much clarit=\r\ny to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even with=\r\nout giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit =\r\nthe lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were alr=\r\neady there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the l=\r\night. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of di=\r\nrt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self)=\r\n that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice tha=\r\nt dirt ourselves..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Homam and other spiritual sadhana to=\r\nols are very helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one&#39;=\r\ns thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, t=\r\nhis does not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take=\r\n a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path an=\r\nd\n not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walkin=\r\ng without distractions will reach the goal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The point I want to emph=\r\nasize is that the external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspect=\r\nion (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will =\r\nbe synergy between them and they will start to work together very effective=\r\nly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:narayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;narayan.iyer=\r\n@ gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some =\r\nramblings ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anyt=\r\nhing similar to it), it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens with all beginners and its only pra=\r\nctice which makes one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; perfect. Most of us assume that this is only =\r\napplicable in mundane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; matters. This is applicable in the path of sp=\r\nirituality too. I\n know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there are people who think that any affair/=\r\nprocess related to God must&lt;BR&gt;&gt; be done perfectly. Honestly ... unless =\r\none is an adept, this is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; impossible and only repeated and sincere a=\r\nttempts makes one an adept.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Reminds me of the great Kalida=\r\nsa who worshipped Goddess Mahakali for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nine lives and he was born a=\r\n dunce in his tenth and she appeared to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him in his 10th lifetime, w=\r\nhen his sadhana was complete and he banged&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his head out of sheer fr=\r\nustration. Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa, surrendering to=\r\n ones chosen deity is the best path for most. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me shar=\r\ne one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conside=\r\nr my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Chandi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa)=\r\n to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When =\r\nI got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; o=\r\nccured to\n me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasiona=\r\nlly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated in it=\r\n, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, whi=\r\nch he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense brains =\r\n:). I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never ga=\r\nve up,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he =\r\nreally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show =\r\nme the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has=\r\n\n decided&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I jus=\r\nt couldnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipoten=\r\nt for his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at i=\r\nt taking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nI thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for helping&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; me progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist w=\r\nith it no matter what. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But the=\r\nn nobody got perfect the very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; first time, unless he has worked on i=\r\nt a lot in his previous lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry abou=\r\nt time, we have future lives ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; plenty of time. These things take =\r\ntheir own sweet time, doesnt happen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; overnight. No matter what, comp=\r\nlete your homa everyday, that should be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the primary goal ... nothin=\r\ng else. Pls dont waver from it, whether you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get or dont get\n anythi=\r\nng. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; move on to higher thin=\r\ngs. I wish all the best. We should really thank&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our stars that peop=\r\nle like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; us ... what would=\r\n be life without them!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks for listening.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regar=\r\nds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Narayan-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and cashing=\r\n it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to=\r\n the bank and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.
