Hope you won&#39;t mind.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBackground for others:\n=\r\n \nThis young man is an advaitin and interested in self-knowledge. He is hig=\r\nhly attached to Aadi Shankara. He highly regards those learning and chantin=\r\ng Vedas. He also highly regards those who renounce material world, live sim=\r\nple lives in simple settings and take up austere lifestyles. He has a negat=\r\nive opinion on tantra and, to some extent, on rituals that are not &quot;Vedic&quot; =\r\nin his view.\n \nHe mentioned to me once that knowledge taught by someone not=\r\n following &quot;austerities&quot; is useless. He thought that austerities are vital =\r\nto getting self-knowledge. His idea of austerity is living a simple life in=\r\n simple settings with maximum isolation from the material world.\n \nI argued=\r\n: &quot;usually austerities are performed by those getting self-knowledge, but a=\r\nusterities are neither necessary nor sufficient to get self-knowledge. A se=\r\nlf-realized person may be living a seemingly opulent or even debased lifest=\r\nyle, but his mind may be detached. For example, Girish was highly regarded =\r\nby Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, but he associated with drunkards and prosti=\r\ntutes and ended up transforming many people who had no hope otherwise. Jana=\r\nka lived as a king in the middle of opulence, but was as detached as any ri=\r\nshi. Thus, what kind of austerities one seems to follow externally may or m=\r\nay not have a bearing on one&#39;s knowledge and level of spiritual evolution. =\r\nWhether and what austerities one follows externally is not the main factor,=\r\n but one&#39;s mental state is what matters. How attached one is to one&#39;s actio=\r\nns and their fruits decides how free one is and that decides how complete o=\r\nne&#39;s knowledge is. If one has a rina with some drunkards and nature takes o=\r\nne to a club to give something to a few drunkards, a liberated man may even=\r\n go to a club and interact with them. The issue is not *what* one does, but=\r\n with what mental attitude one does it and how much attachment one has to t=\r\nhe results. I am not saying that you should do such things, but realize tha=\r\nt some realized people may do it. Do not dismiss people based on external f=\r\nactors. Follow your path, but have respect for all paths.&quot;\n \nHe was taken a=\r\nback and protested that I have been too influenced by &quot;tantra&quot;. He sent a f=\r\new quotes from Srimad Bhagavad Gita to support his view on austerities (see=\r\n below). I will now reply to his mail quoted below.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nSri Krishna said in 18.4 quoted below that sacrifice, giving and austerity=\r\n are not to be given up ever. They never become an obstacle to self-realiza=\r\ntion. Though some philosophers said all actions should be rejected as they =\r\nbind one, Krishna made it very clear that some actions should never be give=\r\nn up and they do not bind one when performing without an attachment to the =\r\nfruits of the actions.\n \nAnyone who is not yet liberated obviously has seve=\r\nral pending kaarmik debts. Until they are paid off, Nature will not let tha=\r\nt person become free. So one needs to somehow pay those debts back, without=\r\n incurring newer debts. Thus, the idea of some philosophers that you need t=\r\no give up all action is illogical. If you give up all action, you can never=\r\n pay off pending debts. No wonder Krishna says some actions should never be=\r\n given up. Even Vasishtha teaches at the beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that=\r\n action and knowledge are the two wings with which the bird of soul flies o=\r\nff and becomes liberated.\n \nBut your idea of acceptable actions seems to be=\r\n to sit in a small hut in a secluded place and do external austerities. Tha=\r\nt can help one control the mind and not incur new kaarmik debts, but how do=\r\nes it help one pay off previous kaarmik debts? Through austerity, one can p=\r\nay off some kinds of karmik debts, but some firm karmaik debts require one =\r\nto interact with others. So, interacting with others and giving things back=\r\n to others are needed to pay off all debts and become free.\n \nAfter all, Sr=\r\ni Krishna included sacrifice and giving, in addition to austerities, when l=\r\nisting the actions that must never be given up! One should sacrifice one&#39;s =\r\ninterests and give to others. One should do that without worrying about the=\r\n end result of the action.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNow, the question is who=\r\n to give and what to give. What is the &quot;obligatory action&quot; referred below?\n=\r\n \nThat can change from one person to another. Swadharma, or the right thing=\r\n to do for an individual, is decided for each individual based on previous =\r\nmental conditioning and previous kaarmik debts. One of the goals of sadhana=\r\n is find one&#39;s swadharma and discharge it. One will never fully and clearly=\r\n know one&#39;s correct dharma. As one discharges some of one&#39;s responsibilitie=\r\ns, as one&#39;s ego becomes less, as one&#39;s attachment to the fruits of one&#39;s ac=\r\ntions becomes less, one becomes purer. As one becomes purer, one&#39;s understa=\r\nnding of swadharma becomes clearer.\n \nOne person&#39;s dharma may be kill his g=\r\nurus, brothers etc (Arjuna). One person&#39;s dharma may be to live in a palace=\r\n and rule a big kingdom (Janaka). One person&#39;s dharma may be to spend time =\r\nwith drunkards and prostitutes and slowly teach them about god in a way the=\r\ny can understand (Girish). One person&#39;s dharma may be to roam the whole cou=\r\nntry or the world, debate with others and establish knowledge of Adwaita (A=\r\nadi Shankara and Vivekananda). There is no absolute right or wrong. What is=\r\n right action for one person may be wrong action for another. For example, =\r\nSwami Chandrasekhara Saraswati, an undoubtedly liberated soul, considered c=\r\nrossing ocean a sin based on tradition and refused to leave India&#39;s shores.=\r\n But people like Swami Vivekananda and Srila Prabhupada crossed oceans to t=\r\neach sublime knowledge in foreign lands. What each one did was right for hi=\r\nm.\n \n*        *        *\n \nGiven that one&#39;s own dharma may be *anything*, i=\r\nt is important to not close one&#39;s mind to some actions. If one controls the=\r\n mind&#39;s pre-occupation with self-gratification, controls ego, if one develo=\r\nps the ability to do what one can do for others without expecting anything =\r\nin return, then Nature will slowly take one towards more and more aspects o=\r\nf one&#39;s own dharma.\n \nOne who has strong preconceived notions of right and =\r\nwrong and closing the mind to some things may end up running away from one&#39;=\r\ns own dharma due to the aversion to some actions!\n \nSri Krishna clarified i=\r\nn verse 18.10 below that one should not dislike a disagreeable work or be a=\r\nttached to an agreeable work. If one is fascinated by living in a secluded =\r\nplace or doing specific external austerities (what you call &quot;the saatvic au=\r\nsterities&quot;) and if one finds certain things disagreeable (e.g. going to a c=\r\nlub, interacting with practitioners of a specific path, living in opulent c=\r\nonditions) and ends up avoiding disagreeable work and picking agreeable wor=\r\nk, one is violating what Krishna said in 18.10.\n \nIf one says &quot;I will sacri=\r\nfice, but only X and Y; I will give, but only X and Y and only to A and B; =\r\nI will do austerities, but only X and Ys&quot;, that is reflective of one&#39;s mis-=\r\nconceptions and effectively one has an attachment to the results of actions=\r\n and perhaps to the actions themselves. That is not saattwik renunciation.\n=\r\n \nSattwik renunciation as taught by Sri Krishna below is one where one feel=\r\ns comfortable engaging in any acts of sacrifice, giving and self-restraint,=\r\n without any attachment to the results.\n \nAll interaction with other object=\r\ns of the field of duality involves give and take. Actions where one is obli=\r\nvious to what one receives and focuses only on giving to others, will free =\r\none from kaarmik debts without incurring new debts. If one lives in a palac=\r\ne and mentally enjoys the comforts there, one is &quot;receiving&quot; something from=\r\n the external world. That will make one incur new kaarmik debts. On the oth=\r\ner hand, if one lives in a palace, lives in great comforts and yet manages =\r\nto keep the mind disengaged and oblivious to the comforts, then one is not =\r\ngetting anything from the external world. The idea is to stop receiving thi=\r\nngs from others and yet keep giving things to others. Eventually all the de=\r\nbts will be finished off.\n \nGiving up specific things because one thinks th=\r\ney are bad is not saattwik renunciation. Giving up attachment to the result=\r\ns even as one engages in actions and giving up likes and dislikes at the me=\r\nntal level is saattwik renunciation. Sacrificing self-interests and giving =\r\nthings to others, while restraining the mind from its preoccupation with se=\r\nlf-gratificatiton and without any attachment to the result is saattwik renu=\r\nnciation. Giving whatever one is in a position to give and someone else is =\r\nin a position to receive, with total oblivion to what one receives in retur=\r\nn, is saattwik renunciation. Notions like &quot;I need to avoid this action beca=\r\nuse it is disagreeable&quot; and &quot;I should somehow do this action because this i=\r\ns agreeable&quot; are blockages.\n \nIf one avoids such notions, gives more and mo=\r\nre to others, becomes more and more oblivious to what one receives in retur=\r\nn and one&#39;s ego becomes less and less, then one will become clearer and cle=\r\narer regarding what one needs to do and slowly marches on the path to self-=\r\nknowledge.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRead the story of Choodala and Sikhidhwa=\r\nja in Yoga Vaasishtham, which was taught by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama=\r\n to impart self-knowledge to Lord Rama. King Sikhidhwaja leaves his kingdom=\r\n, goes to a forest, lives in a hut and does austerities for many years and =\r\nyet does not realize Self. His wife Choodala remains in the palace and yet =\r\nbecomes realized. She later comes to her husband and helps him in his effor=\r\nt to realize Self. She talks to him about physical austerities vs mental at=\r\ntitude and sinternal transformation. I suggest reading and pondering that s=\r\ntory.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBottomline: Knowledge of someone following gr=\r\neat external austerities and yet having a lot of mental conditioning in the=\r\n form of likes, dislikes, pride, sense of doership, expectations from other=\r\ns etc, may still be incorrect as one is not yet realized. It may be &quot;mere i=\r\nnformation&quot; as you say. On the other hand, knowledge of someone not followi=\r\nng any external austerities and yet having no ego and no mental conditionin=\r\ng may be perfect.\n \nOf course, I have nothing against austerities. They are=\r\n often helpful. But, realize that the true renunciation is at the mental le=\r\nvel and external austerities do not guarantee it. Combine external austerit=\r\nies and rituals with constant self-examination and contemplation. There is =\r\nno single path. Follow the path you like, but somehow engineer an internal =\r\ntransformation. While you work on that, it is useful to have healthy respec=\r\nt for various paths and various masters, instead of looking down upon some =\r\npeople (e.g. those who do not follow &quot;saatvic austerities&quot;).\n \nBest regards=\r\n,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:=\r\n//vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- On Su=\r\nn, 10/25/09, &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:\n \n    Dear PVR,\n    For the sake of not limit=\r\ning our discussion to a mere argument, I present the below verses from SBG-=\r\nXVIII chapter. Verse 5, 6 settles the matter we discussed.  Verse 5 discuss=\r\nes what is to be done (for self-knowledge as the goal) and 6 says that even=\r\n those good actions should be without attachment.There is no where it is en=\r\ncouraged, supported or rationalized one to engage in Nishiddha Karma. Howev=\r\ner verse 9 can be very easily misunderstood by making one engage in Nishidd=\r\nha and saying that it is Lords wish and that it was done without any attach=\r\nment.\n     \n    So to me knowledge (as far as self knowledge is concerned) =\r\nwithout the saatvic austerities is mere information, it cannot sprout. We s=\r\nee that a lot in western philosophy. Based on your time kindly see atleast =\r\n4, 5,6,9 below (Swami Sivananda&#39;s true translation of the few verses).\n    =\r\n \n    &lt;deleted&gt;\n     \n    XVIII\n    Kaamyaanaam karmanaam nyaasam sannyaasa=\r\nm kavayoviduh;\n    Sarvakarmaphalatyaagam praahustyaagam vichakshanaah.\n   =\r\n The Blessed Lord said:\n    2. The sages understand Sannyas to be the renun=\r\nciation of action with desire; the wise\n    declare the abandonment of the =\r\nfruits of all actions as Tyaga.\n     \n    Tyaajyam doshavadityeke karma pra=\r\nahurmaneeshinah;\n    Yajnadaanatapah karma na tyaajyamiti chaapare.\n    3. =\r\nSome philosophers declare that all actions should be abandoned as an evil, =\r\nwhile others\n    declare that acts of gift, sacrifice and austerity should =\r\nnot be relinquished.\n     \n    Nishchayam shrinu me tatra tyaage bharatasat=\r\ntama;\n    Tyaago hi purushavyaaghra trividhah samprakeertitah.\n    4. Hear =\r\nfrom Me the conclusion or the final truth about this abandonment, O best of=\r\n the\n    Bharatas; abandonment, verily, O best of men, has been declared to=\r\n be of three kinds!\n     \n    Yajnadaanatapah karma na tyaajyam kaaryameva =\r\ntat;\n    Yajno daanam tapashchaiva paavanaani maneeshinaam.\n    5. Acts of =\r\nsacrifice, gift and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be perfor=\r\nmed;\n    sacrifice, gift and also austerity are the purifiers of the wise.\n=\r\n     \n    Etaanyapi tu karmaani sangam tyaktwaa phalaani cha;\n    Kartavyaa=\r\nneeti me paartha nishchitam matamuttamam.\n    6. But even these actions sho=\r\nuld be performed leaving aside attachment and the desire for\n    rewards, O=\r\n Arjuna! This is My certain and best conviction.\n     \n    Niyatasya tu san=\r\nnyaasah karmano nopapadyate;\n    Mohaattasya parityaagas taamasah parikeert=\r\nitah.\n    7. Verily, the renunciation of obligatory action is improper; the=\r\n abandonment of the same\n    from delusion is declared to be Tamasic.\n     =\r\n\n    Duhkhamityeva yat karma kaayakleshabhayaat tyajet;\n    Sa kritwaa raaj=\r\nasam tyaagam naiva tyaagaphalam labhet.\n    8. He who abandons action on ac=\r\ncount of the fear of bodily trouble (because it is painful), he\n    does no=\r\nt obtain the merit of renunciation by doing such Rajasic renunciation.\n    =\r\n \n    Kaaryamityeva yatkarma niyatam kriyate=E2=80=99rjuna;\n    Sangam tyak=\r\ntwaa phalam chaiva sa tyaagah saattwiko matah.\n    9. Whatever obligatory a=\r\nction is done, O Arjuna, merely because it ought to be done,\n    abandoning=\r\n attachment and also the desire for reward, that renunciation is regarded a=\r\ns Sattwic!\n     \n    Na dweshtyakushalam karma kushale naanushajjate;\n    T=\r\nyaagee sattwasamaavishto medhaavee cchinnasamshayah.\n    10. The man of ren=\r\nunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent and with his doubts cut\n    asun=\r\nder, does not hate a disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable o=\r\nne.\n     \n    Na hi dehabhritaa shakyam tyaktum karmaanyasheshatah;\n    Yas=\r\ntu karmaphalatyaagi sa tyaageetyabhidheeyate.\n    11. Verily, it is not pos=\r\nsible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but he who\n    rel=\r\ninquishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation.\n\n\n"}}
