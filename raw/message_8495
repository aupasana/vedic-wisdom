Some years back I went to Delhi for fe=\r\nw days and stayed at my friend&#39;s house which was on fifth floor. The buildi=\r\nng was new and he told me after he moved in with his family they had done b=\r\nig haven of this mantra.\n&gt; During night before I went to sleep I was trying=\r\n to do=A0a eye open meditation and was in a slight trance.Suddenly I notice=\r\nd some spirits/entities were trying to come in the room through window but =\r\nthey could not come as there was a covering of white light there. I knew im=\r\nmediately it is the effect of that haven in the house. Now in the link arti=\r\ncle same thing is mentioned as a psychic shield.

You are doing such a intense workout with your everyday no=\r\nrmal life and it is making Divine Lord take a turn on His Waterbed in Milk =\r\nOcean and take a look towards earth plane. Did you know this?\n&gt; And what wi=\r\nll happen when you are holding phone and pretending and it actually rings. =\r\nYour workmate will know your secret.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, 25 June 2012, 19:37\n&gt;=\r\n Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mahamrityunjaya and Divine Namapathy\n&gt; \n&gt; Greeting=\r\ns,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you&#39;re all well, and that your sadhanas are going fantasticall=\r\ny well (especially after we all told each other to get verrrry serious). \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;ve had a gruelling few shifts in hospital the last few days, includin=\r\ng witnessing some unfortunately inevitable deaths in very sick people...som=\r\nething that has become part of my daily life as a doctor. It is weird to se=\r\ne how the body loses all importance the moment it dies. It is also strange =\r\nhow a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactly like someone just =\r\nleft. It certainly makes one think that there must be something more to us =\r\nthan this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old age, fill=\r\ned with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous in death. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIt is interesting to think about what one can do to help the sick and dying=\r\n, when they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch=\r\n someone die while feeling utterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n&gt; \n&gt; Siv=\r\nananda used to have great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Nam=\r\napathy&quot;. While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, h=\r\ne used to say that, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and=\r\n heal us on all levels- physical, mental and spiritual. \n&gt; \n&gt; While he said=\r\n all names of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentio=\r\nned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especial=\r\nly for those who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; \n&gt; He says &quot;Maha Mrityunjaya Man=\r\ntra will remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and immo=\r\nrtality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I visited the Sivananda Charitabl=\r\ne hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and nu=\r\nrses who work there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including the =\r\nMahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each other and the whole world. I beli=\r\neve it is the same with the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a won=\r\nderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for anyone who knows people=\r\n who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunately u=\r\nnwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or to=\r\n help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because Yo=\r\nu know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless =\r\nthat happens to be the Will of God). \n&gt; \n&gt; At any point in time, there are =\r\nseveral human beings, animals and various creatures who are dying, and unfo=\r\nrtunately suffering greatly during the process of dying. I think it would b=\r\ne nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our =\r\nsages say it works, and I believe them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a link for those who =\r\nare interested in learning more about this great mantra. The article is wri=\r\ntten by a disciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very recent times. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
