I reproduce it if it can help you:=\r\n\n\nFollowing is my email to him:\n[\nAbout the strange incident:\n  \nToday afte=\r\nr Purnaahuti Mantra, when i was about to offer/or just at the time of offer=\r\ning the Dry Halve coconut, one insect (a kind of butterfly i suppose with b=\r\nig wings) suddenly came and fell in the Homa agni. it got stuck under a bur=\r\nning coconut piece and couldn&#39;t come out even i couldn&#39;t do anything becaus=\r\ne every thing happened in a flash, within span of 4/5 seconds. it pained me=\r\n and shocked me. The insect got burnt immediately as the fire was burning v=\r\nery bright. Fortunately i could not see that sight because it was under coc=\r\nonut pieces.\n&gt;  \n&gt; i close my eyes and prayed Mahaganapati for Sadgati of t=\r\nhat soul.\n&gt;  \n&gt; What is your feeling about this issue? Does the accidental =\r\nsacrifice of the insect signify some Ashubh tatva? How should i take this? =\r\nOr simply forget.\n \nNarasimha replied me not to worry about the incident an=\r\nd I forgot it completely. I just removed it from my mind.\n\n***\nI think you =\r\nneed not worry about the particular incident. Homam should make one very st=\r\nrong and &#39;worry-less&#39;. One should be compassionate but at the same time, ne=\r\ned not worry about such incidents on which one can not do anything. I sugge=\r\nst you all pray for the souls of kittens during your prayer/Homam and forge=\r\nt the incident.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Hell All,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; A cat =\r\ngave birth to 2 kittens in my backyard.

Does this kind of incident indicate anything bad for us, will there=\r\n be any remedy that we can perform for such? Please suggest.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks=\r\n\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
