Before that i went thru the detailed procedure for tarpana in t=\r\nhe manual and found it quite daunting. But for some reason i wanted to pour=\r\n water on my hand. Sometimes one cannot explain these urges...sometimes the=\r\ny appear to be too irrational. i read about the tarpanam with milk in the h=\r\nomam manual and have already started doing this.\n\nyou are right that the at=\r\ntitude with which we invite the atithi is what is important...the way we in=\r\nvite him / the rituals are secondary.\n\nwhy i asked the somewhat stupid ques=\r\ntion about invoking the deity is that i have not felt the atithi walk into =\r\nmy home. i may not have invited him sincerely enough. maybe as the purifica=\r\ntion takes place and the heart opens up more to these things the atithi may=\r\n start coming even when he is not invoked / invited thru rituals :)\n\ntill s=\r\nuch time i think i will continue waiting...and watching....even if it takes=\r\n many lifetimes!\n\nthankyou.\n\n\np.s.\n\nwhat i have definitely felt is the kind=\r\nness of the thoughts of the members of this forum.\n\n\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

In the super-short procedure, we just invite the \n&gt; deity into fi=\r\nre and request to be established in fire. In step 5 of the bare \n&gt; minimum =\r\nprocedure, you think of a deity and start offering into fire \n&gt; assuming th=\r\ne deity is already in fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to clarify=\r\n one thing. You can invite someone to your house by writing \n&gt; a formal inv=\r\nitation letter. You can invite someone by sending a small note. \n&gt; You can =\r\ninvite someone by a small word orally. There are many ways. Whether \n&gt; one =\r\nactually comes to your house or not and how long one stays is not \n&gt; necess=\r\narily dependent on how detailed and formal your invitation is. One \n&gt; guest=\r\n receiving a detailed invitation letter may drop by for just a few \n&gt; minut=\r\nes. Another friend may come and stay for a day even if you casually ask \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;what are you doing this Saturday&quot; and not formally invite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly,=\r\n how much of divine presence your homam (or any ritual) attracts \n&gt; is inde=\r\npendent of what procedure you used to call the deity. It depends on \n&gt; your=\r\n purity, the nature of the place and time and, above all, the kindness \n&gt; o=\r\nf the deity at that particular time. Based on the best of your learning and=\r\n \n&gt; ability, use a procedure that you think is appropriate. But do remember=\r\n that \n&gt; procedures are secondary and devotion and faith are primary.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tar=\r\npana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; Prana=\r\nm, Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i read postings selectively and therefore have miss=\r\ned several useful \n&gt; &gt; information on tarpana. the message u have posted is=\r\n indeed very \n&gt; &gt; informative. though one knows that sun symbolises the sou=\r\nl and moon the \n&gt; &gt; mind i never thought in terms of &quot;subtle&quot; karmas being =\r\nburnt thru homam \n&gt; &gt; and &quot;gross&quot; karmas of pitris being burnt thru tarpana=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There have been years of trying one thing after another in the ho=\r\npe of \n&gt; &gt; dissolving karmas. Sometimes i doubted my own sincerety...someti=\r\nmes i \n&gt; &gt; thought my karmas must indeed be very deep rooted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my=\r\n years of trying to find answers thru astrology i blamed 3 retro \n&gt; &gt; plane=\r\nts for the deep rooted karmas. In terms of your posting from the \n&gt; &gt; archi=\r\nves i see things in a slightly different light.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sun is conjoined wi=\r\nth combust retro Mercury which in turn is closely \n&gt; &gt; conjoined with Ketu =\r\nmaking it a malefic. Sun is aspected by retro Mars and \n&gt; &gt; of course Rahu.=\r\n The only saving grace is that Jupiter is also there with \n&gt; &gt; Sun. So mayb=\r\ne there are lots of subtle karmas to be burnt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for the Moon it i=\r\ns aspected by retro exalted Saturn from the house of \n&gt; &gt; rin (6th) as well=\r\n as retro Mars (8th H) and conjoined with lagnesh Venus \n&gt; &gt; (self). So may=\r\nbe there are lots of gross karmas to be dissolved thru \n&gt; &gt; tarpana. And be=\r\ncause Moon is with Lagnesh maybe tarpana is even more \n&gt; &gt; necessary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; i sincerely believe in the energies around us and a whole subtle world \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; waiting to be accessed / experienced. Even though at present there is n=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; direct experience of such a world, maybe as things progress...there =\r\nmay be \n&gt; &gt; tranformations...to enable a better understanding of these thin=\r\ngs...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, for asking who is Rama at the end of Ramayana...but i =\r\nwould still \n&gt; &gt; like to know how deities are invoked in fire. I have been =\r\nperforming the \n&gt; &gt; bare minimum homam that u described in one of your mess=\r\nages. i follow all \n&gt; &gt; the 7 steps described there. In step number 5 where=\r\n u say &quot;pick any deity \n&gt; &gt; and any mantra&quot;, i recite &quot;om gam ganapataye na=\r\nmah&quot;. In step no.6 while \n&gt; &gt; pouring ghee i recite &quot;om bhuh swahaa, om bhu=\r\nvah swahaa, om suvah swaaha, \n&gt; &gt; om bhurbhuvahsuvah swahaa, om shri vishna=\r\nve swahaa, om namo rudraaye \n&gt; &gt; pashupataye swaaha&quot;. Then i place a piece =\r\nof dry coconut in the hom and \n&gt; &gt; sit for meditation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is the deity=\r\n invoked at this point?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If i want to include pitri tarpana also in =\r\nthis, how do i go about it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t know if i am done!

Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does have an im=\r\npact on \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is particularly true with respect to the =\r\nminds of people who have \n&gt; &gt;&gt; genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you.

While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pray =\r\nthat the ancestor&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires may be satisfied and the ancestor may be =\r\novercome the weaknesses. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; By praying for helping an ancestor, you are =\r\nindirectly helping yourself, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; by removing a powerful negative influenc=\r\ne on your mind and getting rid of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; some weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Unfortun=\r\nately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fashion=\r\n today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously if they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; do =\r\nit atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says that he \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wi=\r\nll pick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can perform.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used =\r\nto perform a fire ritual and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Ritua=\r\nls use external symbols to induce \n&gt; &gt;&gt; internal changes. These two rituals=\r\n are really important and useful \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rituals.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A small compariso=\r\nn of homam and tarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yahoogroup arc=\r\nhives:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One word on Homam vs Tarpa=\r\nna. In homam, you are calling devatas and the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; medium is fire. In tarp=\r\nana, you are calling pitris and the medium is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; water. Both sadhanas ar=\r\ne applicable to all people irrespective of whether \n&gt; &gt;&gt; watery signs/plane=\r\nts are strong or fiery signs/planets in their \n&gt; &gt;&gt; horoscope.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In=\r\n homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nyou. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (cond=\r\nitioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yo=\r\nu have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weakness=\r\nes. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirt=\r\nh to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a =\r\nnew body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not af=\r\nfect your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut of=\r\nf a strong \n&gt; &gt;&gt; source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously com=\r\nmitted bad \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual pro=\r\ngress.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self=\r\n-identification \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. T=\r\nhey work on your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; individual soul and free it from the karmas it carri=\r\nes. Pitris are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments=\r\n and desires. Their \n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-identification is with what is known as mind=\r\n and represented by \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associat=\r\ned with Devas and Pitris \n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the hora chart of astrology. Fire and wat=\r\ner are the natural media for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; them respectively.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devas and p=\r\nitris have different ways of working and influencing us and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; helping o=\r\nur spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all of us and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; have a =\r\nrole to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in fire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; an=\r\nd satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &lt;ramki108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks f=\r\nor this valuable manual.
