You dont have to even think about it ..if its there it will be=\r\n taken care of .. Of course only if it really needs to be taken care of and=\r\n if she deems it to be so..\n\nI usually perform homam with the 1,2,4,5 and t=\r\nhe 11th Chapters since I am still learning the recitation of the remaining =\r\nchapters. This day I brought 1 Kg of Dry Cocunuts for the homam along with =\r\nsome jaggery  .sesame seeds etc.. I usually use cocunuts for majority of th=\r\ne chapters along with the other materials for the 11th chapter since Cocunu=\r\nts help to burn the items nicely.. I make every thing ready the previous ni=\r\nght so that I dont have to run around in the early morning (5 AM) when I do=\r\n the homam....I prepare the other prasadam like Jaggery,Sesame seeds,Pomegr=\r\nanate seeds,Puffed rice etc just before starting the homam.. For some stran=\r\nge reason I forgot this part so all that I was left with were the cocunut p=\r\nieces .. I did not realise this till I was already well into the 2 or 3rd c=\r\nhapter.. I didnt want to stop in between the homam for preparing the second=\r\n prasadam..\n\n\nWhile performing the homam I realised in between that I might=\r\n fall well short of the cocunut pieces much before the completion of the 11=\r\nth chapter and I might have to take a break to make some other prasadam and=\r\n was hoping deparately that this will not happen... But wonder of wonders t=\r\no my surprise the last cocunut piece offered was also the last sloka of the=\r\n 11th Chapter... This might well be a coincidence but the probability of th=\r\nis happening is very rare considering that the number Navarna mantra and Ga=\r\nnesh Pooja offerings at the begining of the homam are something which I don=\r\nt keep count of... A very simple instance of how the mother has prempted th=\r\ne fear in advance.. \n\nRegards,\nGirish S\n\n\n"}}
