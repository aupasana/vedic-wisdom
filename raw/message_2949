If the person doing praana pratishtha is able to focus the mind so perfectly on that form, fill the mind with that form and then direct that mind towards the idol, that will result in that form being established in the idol. That is the case with a perfect praana pratishtha.\n \nBut, there are hardly any people today who can do praana pratishtha well. There are hardly any people who can focus the mind on god perfectly. In that case, any focused thoughts of the worshipper now and then will slowly get lodged and create an identity for that idol slowly, over the time.\n \n(2) Sanskrit is made of syllables that reverberate in various parts of the body when experiencing various deities. The mantras in Praana Pratishthaa try to aid in that process. However, even if one who does not know the praaana pratishthaa mantras ends up with one&#39;s mind absorbed in a specific deity somehow, one will experience the same thing.\n \nChanting praana pratishtha mantras in Sanskrit is neither necessary nor sufficient to invoke a deity, but it is helpful to form the visualization. It is a useful tool and not an end by itself.\n \n*        *        *\n \nMore than technicalities, what is important is internal purity. How much does it bother one when others insult one? How much does it excite one when others praise one? How strong is the idea that one is doing things? How strong is the attachment to body, name and other material belongings? These are the key things. Somehow or the other, one needs to make progress and achieve a level of equanimity.\n \nThen one can focus the mind on a deity and establish a corresponding energy in an object, such as an idol or kalasha or fire or even one&#39;s own being.\n \nFor example, please see the experience narrated in\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n \nThe person did not do specific mantras for doing praana pratishthaa, but what happened essentially was a praana pratishthaa.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn the old days, there were many braahmanas who were pure like fire. Nowadays, there are very very few. The need of the hour is creation of such a class of braahmanas. If that happens, so many things will automatically happen on earth.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI was a Sanskrit scholar from childhood. I passed two series of exams, both equivalent to BA degree in Sanskrit, by the age of 11, one of them with distinction. I used to compose metred poetry in Sanskrit like ancients, with a good level of fluency, when I was 10. When I studied for those Sanskrit exams, it used to feel like I knew all that stuff before and was just revising. Sanskrit came to me very naturally. My pronunciation was good and my understanding of various expressions and concepts of Sanskrit quite thorough.\n \nNevertheless that never gave me any spiritual experiences nor did it take me close to self-knowledge. As long as I had pride in my knowledge and abilities, I was stuck. I started real progress only after my senses were turned inward and my pride and other internal enemies were controlled somewhat. From my experience, I know what is more important and what is less important. So, while I definitely do not discourage people from learning Sanskrit or making their Sanskrit better, I emphasize internal transformation more.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBottomline: When you do praana pratishthaapana in an idol or fire as a part of a ritual, do the best you can, with respect to picking and pronouncing the mantras. Do believe sincerely that the deity is there. Have faith and be sincere, humble and respectful. At other times, work on your attitude and on the internal enemies. That is more important than the technicalities.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that always judge a\n&gt; holy man not just by his words but by his conduct as well. That is really the\n&gt; BEST way to form some opinion about people who claim to be spiritual.\n \nYes, when there is a need to form an opinion on someone, perhaps because one wants to become a disciple or otherwise follow that holy man, one can do that.\n \nMy point is this: bear the karma of judging (and commenting on) someone only when there is a clear need based on your dharma. Moreover, when judging ancient personalities like some were doing when I made my comments, one can easily make mistakes.\n \nInstead of judging others, one can judge oneself. There will be plenty of faults that can be corrected. After one focuses one&#39;s senses and critical faculties inward, removes tamas and rajas and makes spiritual progress, one will be clear about one&#39;s dharma. If such a person&#39;s dharma requires one to judge and criticize a holy man publicly, that is a different matter.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some more queries came up while thinking about the idol worship etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1) My question is, so eventually some thoughts/emotions of the worshipper gets lodged in the idol, both positive and negative. What is the relevance of doing a pranpratistha in an idol? Will not the ritual of pranpratistha bring the energy of the deity into the idol? If it does, then how can the emotions/thoughts of the worshipper get lodged in the idol since it already contains the energy of the deity?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Or does it mean that the energy/emotions of the worshipper get lodged in an idol where the pranpratistha ritual has been incorrectly/incompletely done, which happens so often in the case of idols at home.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2) What is the relevance of the Sanskrit language in pranpratistha ritual.  Or rather, the significance of Sanskrit when it comes to spirituality in general. If the pranpratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other language and used, will it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of the person doing the prasnpratistha to be a constant?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I mean, let us leave aside the case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha of an idol because someone like Him does not need language to call the deity into an idol. But for others, how important is Sanskrit?\n&gt;  \n&gt; .....................................................................................................................\n&gt; .....................................................................................................................\n&gt;  \n&gt; On a different issue about judging so called holy men from history - a deviation - I would like to make one point. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise\n&gt;  \n&gt; While what you say is correct, there can always be some rational judgement passed on figures from history based on incontrovertible evidence. And I don&#39;t mean the actions of their followers but the very own lives of these people as recorded by their contemporaries. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that always judge a holy man not just by his words but by his conduct as well. That is really the BEST way to form some opinion about people who claim to be spiritual. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Therefore, if a historically authentic biography of a spiritual person is read and compared with standard models of spirtuality/spiritual life along with the words/saying of the person, one can make a fair judgement. It is using these tools that one can very easily question the spiritual realizations of some so called prophets in history. \n&gt;  \n&gt; If the seed is questionable, the fruits are bound to be rotten.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 10/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

While different places and times have some difference in the nature and degree of spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if the internal factors are conducive.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind that any observation is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/\n&gt; &gt; destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is\n&gt; &gt; reaching God, is it not enough?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on that specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, there is some translation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, please note that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, please note that most people have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practices without understanding what they are doing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; is Idol worship risky?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?\n&gt;  \n&gt; God created man as his replica. But the replica got corrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that he can go back to the source and become free from this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will match the god that created man in the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free from the cycle.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about respected spiritual leaders of other religions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In general, please remember that saying negative things about people that one may not have understood fully or correctly is unwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; From time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world to maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in that part of the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow that person. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that person! If some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of realization, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is unhappy because of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or spiritual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct things and change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and do your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; To add to my query, a good number of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? \n&gt;  \n&gt; I can understand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human imagination which maynot have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali into an Idol.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/ destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is reaching God, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax collecter of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whether a divine presence is there or not there infront?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I would like to mention a small incident here about someone I know well. There was a certain individual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take time out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.  Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind that night, except for an overwhelming\n&gt;  joy, as he said later on. Bottomline: a nice spiritual experience.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some months later he ended up meeting a very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.  He strongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting with the person was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that there is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine presence why did this person suddenly have such a nice meditation there?  Does it mean that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee which counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has any energy at all?\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, 8 October, 2009, 8:24 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worship risky?

However, eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends on how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In many famous temples these days, priests have become commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed every few years to re-energize the idols \n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left\n&gt;  in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; \n&gt; Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in today&#39;s time.
