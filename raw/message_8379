The hate has to consume you,lets say you hate Vishnu so much tha=\r\nt all day long you are lost in chanting &quot;vishnu ki bhen ki.....&quot; , but it h=\r\nas to be all day long, have to be with a passion that consumes your entire =\r\nexistence. You have to have so much anger every time you hear Vishnu&#39;s name=\r\n, you go into a murderous rage.\n&gt; \n&gt; It happened with a certain Mr Hiranyak=\r\nasipu, and guess what???\n&gt; The lord himself came.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh the blessing!!!!!=\r\n\n&gt; He died in mere maalik&#39;s lap, what would I not give give to have that...=\r\n.... What a fine death. The ripping up of the intestines in most photos you=\r\n see holds a very different meaning than most people interpret it as.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHell due to his hatred, bhagwaan had to himself come to take him. Whether h=\r\ne came to teach Mr Sipu&#39;s (nick name) a lesson or not, it still must have b=\r\neen a fine darshan. Point is the lord comming.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hell due to Raavan&#39;s ma=\r\ndness, the lord in his form of the incharge of preservation and the form in=\r\ncharge of destruction had to go to collect him. Not many understand Ravan, =\r\nhe is infact far beyond us to understand. His penance was so intense, that,=\r\n khair chuck it, whats the point, it will lead to more misinterpretation.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The esoteric meaning of the  story of Mr Hiranyakasipu is mentioned in =\r\na book, I think people who have read the book will know which one it is. It=\r\ns the 2nd part of a trilogy that I consider to be on and above par with any=\r\n religious/spiritual text out there, provided you understand ts true meanin=\r\ng, which takes a lot of effort than merely reading the books.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways,=\r\n So does that mean you keep on abusing god???\n&gt; Nope I am not advocating th=\r\nat BUT\n&gt; You can if you wish to, but do it so, that with your rage you dest=\r\nroy &quot;yourself&quot;, which is the point of any sadhana ,any ritual anyways. But =\r\nno - one barring a few are intense enough these days to do that, and the in=\r\ntense ones are too much in love and don&#39;t have a reason to consider this.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Point of Mr Utpal&#39;s story is something else all together,\n&gt; its with de=\r\ndication and discipline that man reached over to the temple to hit god, no =\r\nmatter what came he still went to hurl his choicest abuses, the devotee did=\r\nn&#39;t go to worship on that stormy day. The abuser&#39;s devotion to abuse is muc=\r\nh higher than that of the devotee&#39;s worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thought the devotee is de=\r\nar to god, the abuser&#39;s devotion to abuse brought the lord down from his ab=\r\node. Same devotion Meera has that for Lord Krishna. Where will Krishna hide=\r\n, if somebody has that kind of devotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its called the &quot;paagal kutta&quot;=\r\n way. You know how paagal kutte are?? If they catch hold of your pyjama, no=\r\n matter you burst its head open with a stick it will not let go without tea=\r\nring you pant off, kuch bhi karlo nahin chhore ga. After all pagal hain If =\r\nyou become a pagal kutta for god, no matter if god destroys &quot;your&quot; money, &quot;=\r\nyour&quot; family, &quot;your&quot; everything and yet you still hang on, you, my son will=\r\n be made.\n&gt; \n&gt; Become a paagal kutta either with anger or love, same thing,=\r\n point is to not let go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bete, try to understand the madness behind th=\r\nat man&#39;s (Story) anger, develop that madness tab toh baat hai nahin toh lag=\r\ne raho bhagwaan ki photo ko laat maarne, paer hi tutega aur kuch nahin hoga=\r\n.\n&gt; He could have chosen not to go because of the storm, like the devotee. =\r\nThe devotee chose his own comfort, ignored his lord&#39;s comfort, but the abus=\r\ner, hell no. He went alright.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you one story more story, inte=\r\nrpret it the way you wish to , I don&#39;t care.\n&gt; There was a man in Benaras, =\r\none day right before his daily homam, when he was cutting gola naariyal for=\r\n the homam, the knife slit through his entire palm, and severed one nerve. =\r\nIt was a pool of blood.Hell there was so much blood,his sister freaked out,=\r\n but that man was thinking of offering it to his mother. What the fuck, you=\r\n must be thinking?? In his pain he was thinking of his mother who is known =\r\nto accept blood.\n&gt; What next, he got into a ritual to offer that blood, the=\r\nn went to the nursery home to get stitches, and when he got back he did his=\r\n homam, with one hand totally in bandage and paining like a bitch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Men=\r\ntally he told god ,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; kya aapko kya laga aisle hi chor doonga????, nahin =\r\nkakaji, aise nahin, hum bhi aashiq sadiyon puraane, chaen tu maane ya na ma=\r\nane &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But then that&#39;s why the world calls him insane.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody is=\r\n a fool in spending time to love god, understand the point of the story, an=\r\nd not get lost in the words.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&quot;\n&gt; Absolute stupidity,please don&#39;t prea=\r\nch any further leave it for the wise they know better. &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; Get us a wise =\r\nperson on this board please.

He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked=\r\n down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand=\r\n him in summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just be=\r\ncause my body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us=\r\n look out for him in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunba=\r\nthe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun f=\r\norgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man on=\r\nly could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The t=\r\nemperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers w=\r\ne hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb =\r\nis so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all becau=\r\nse of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which le=\r\nads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without h=\r\nim, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;=\r\ns , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves=\r\n us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do,=\r\n we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man l=\r\noves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she =\r\nis a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her=\r\n body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell y=\r\nou another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lov=\r\ne with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myse=\r\nlf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of o=\r\nur mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of he=\r\nr from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath=\r\n&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri k=\r\nya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who =\r\nchahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, t=\r\nhis guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are sure =\r\nto get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that so=\r\nmebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You peop=\r\nle love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\ns to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to know wh=\r\nats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rat=\r\nher my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come an=\r\nd tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that=\r\n she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if=\r\n I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can t=\r\nhen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge=\r\n. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. =\r\nThat doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying wh=\r\nat do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne=\r\n ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender=\r\n is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god=\r\n&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender=\r\n, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the =\r\nsame thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, eve=\r\nr to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog=\r\n will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that=\r\n is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him c=\r\nhicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, hi=\r\ns master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy=\r\n. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Equate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; We are never happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actually do=\r\nn&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then w=\r\ne claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit pissed o=\r\nff at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY t=\r\nrying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, t=\r\nhat chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely =\r\ndo want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of=\r\n great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the great dogs, =\r\nand pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is me=\r\nntal masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir=\r\n, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

For The Mother Durga, hatred is a boon IMHO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So do=\r\nnt worry and keep going....blame her, damn her, yell at her as much as you =\r\ncan and keep doing...you are surely blessed if you really start hating her.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a very humerous short story in this regard which h=\r\nas a deep meaning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was a person in a village who use=\r\nd to go to a Temple every morning without fail to praise the Lord and then =\r\ngo to his field for work. in the same village there was another person who =\r\ndisliked and hated God so much that he also used to visit the temple Lord e=\r\nvery day morning without fail, to just yell at lord, abuse the deity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One night, there was a thunderstorm with very hevay rain and in=\r\n the morning, there was waist deep water around temple and it was still rai=\r\nning heavily. The gentle man who liked God thought that It is very heavy ra=\r\nin and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn&#39;t go to temple on that=\r\n morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though could not st=\r\nop himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-s=\r\ntakingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing =\r\nthe deity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The lord became very pleased with him and gave =\r\nhim Darshana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna ji, this is actu=\r\nally not pointed at you.

He was getting irrit=\r\nated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked =\r\nhim, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with swe=\r\nat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming=\r\n out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to dri=\r\nve him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking lo=\r\nve??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pi=\r\ntaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologiz=\r\ned profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he=\r\n is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;,=\r\n no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line =\r\nwas a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving th=\r\ne sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usa=\r\nge, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and=\r\n gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which l=\r\neads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s fo=\r\nremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads t=\r\no no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us=\r\n, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet=\r\n what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this =\r\nworship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t giv=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi,=\r\n he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken wit=\r\nh him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and =\r\nhe is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know t=\r\nhese characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted =\r\nto his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her =\r\nwhy don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told m=\r\ne you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her dau=\r\nghter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe ye=\r\nh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni=\r\n bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lo=\r\nt of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told=\r\n you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You =\r\nlove then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sl=\r\nap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can a=\r\nsk from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask f=\r\nor her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be=\r\n delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i becom=\r\ne big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka ka=\r\nam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god=\r\n herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and=\r\n I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, d=\r\neserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who=\r\n is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have=\r\n surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrend=\r\nered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should =\r\nbe total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warm=\r\ning it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do=\r\n, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;,=\r\n they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are =\r\nyou in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ev=\r\ner need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful =\r\nlife post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq f=\r\neet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest=\r\n men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintai=\r\nned be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when h=\r\ne sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmaster , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthough=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with god, and wha=\r\nt do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master brings, b=\r\necause we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya pane=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar ra=\r\nhe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the foo=\r\nd, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I =\r\nonly want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why a=\r\nre you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, =\r\nalways SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji =\r\nbrings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, th=\r\nat milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag a=\r\nt his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the =\r\nleft handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute yo=\r\nu.
