He lived for a short time in the Satguru\nSwam=\r\ni Cave on the south-eastern slope, then in the Namasivaya Cave. He\nfinally =\r\nsettled down in the Virupaksha Cave,where he remained from 1899 to\n1916.\n\nA=\r\nt the time Ramana took up abode there nobody felt responsible for the\nVirup=\r\naksha math and the cave was empty. There was a lawsuit in progress\nbetween =\r\ntwo different groups, who both claimed possession of, and the income\nfrom, =\r\nthe math. But as no decision had yet been made, nobody was caring for\nit. T=\r\nhe issue of possession was, in fact, only resolved some years later. At\nthe=\r\n following Kartikai festival the successful litigants came up to the cave\na=\r\nnd started charging a fee to visit it. So access to the Swami who lived\nthe=\r\nre suddenly became conditional upon payment of a fee, although he himself\nw=\r\nas not informed of the matter. As large numbers of people were now coming\nu=\r\np to see him, quite a few had to go away disappointed when they were told\nt=\r\nhey had to pay.\n\nWhen Ramana heard about this practice, he left the cave an=\r\nd sat down under a\ntree. Those collecting the fees then declared this place=\r\n also to be an outer\narea belonging to the math and continued to demand mon=\r\ney from all those who\nwanted to approach him. He had no alternative, theref=\r\nore, but to go away\nagain. At first he lived in the Satguru Swami Cave whic=\r\nh was lower down,\nthen in another cave, consequently the Virupaksha Cave wa=\r\ns no longer a\nsource of revenue. The owners of the cave finally understood =\r\nthat they could\nnot misuse the young Swami for their own purpose, so they g=\r\nave up the fees\nthey had collected and asked him to continue to live in the=\r\n cave. As a\nresult Ramana returned and stayed there until 1916.\n\nIn winter =\r\nVirupaksha was a fine lodging, but not so in summer,when the\nadjoining rive=\r\nrbed dried up and there was not the slightest breeze. In\naddition, as there=\r\n were almost no trees, the cave was exposed to the sun, so\nthat it became u=\r\nnbearably hot.\n\nA little higher up the hill, at the foot of a mango tree th=\r\nere was a cave\nknown as the Mango Tree Cave. The nearby Mulaipal Teertham a=\r\nlways had a\nsupply of clean water. The first time Ramana had seen it, it ha=\r\nd been\nuninhabitable. But since then two brothers had removed the overhangi=\r\nng rock,\nhad built a small wall with a door and had made the cave inhabitab=\r\nle. They\nasked the Swami to use it, so he used to spend the summer months h=\r\nere.\n\nLife at the Virupaksha Cave and Mango Tree Cave was rich in privation=\r\ns but\ncarefree, as Ramana himself stated, =E2=80=9CPalaniswami asked me to =\r\ncopy out and\ngive him some stanzas of Shankara, but where were notebooks or=\r\n paper with us\nat the time? I collected every scrap of paper I could, stitc=\r\nhed them\ntogether into a notebook,wrote out the stanzas and gave them to hi=\r\nm. At that\ntime we had nothing but a pot; we did not have even a towel. In =\r\nthe early\ndays of our stay in the Virupaksha Cave, Palaniswami alone had a =\r\ntowel to\nwrap around him. The cave had no iron doors then; it had a wooden =\r\ndoor with\na wooden latch. We would fasten it from the outside with a small =\r\nstick, go\naround the hill, wander hither and yon, return after a week or te=\r\nn days,\nthen open the door with the help of another stick. That was our key=\r\n at the\ntime; no need to keep it anywhere! This notebook was the only artic=\r\nle we\ntook with us. As Palaniswami wore a towel, he used to fold the book a=\r\nnd tuck\nit into his waist. That was enough for us.=E2=80=9D\n\nHis loincloth =\r\nwas also in a poor state, =E2=80=9CMy koupina got torn. I do not\nusually as=\r\nk anyone for anything. Bodily privacy has however to be\nmaintained. Where c=\r\nould I get a needle and thread available to mend the\nkoupina? At last, I go=\r\nt hold of a thorn, made a hole in it,took out a thread\nfrom the koupina its=\r\nelf, put it into the hole and\nthus mended the cloth, and, so as to hide the=\r\n place where it was mended, I\nused to fold it suitably before putting it on=\r\n. Time passed like that. What\ndid we need? Such were those days!=E2=80=9D\n\n=\r\nSri Ramana never wore shoes, not even during the hottest months.Rangan, a\nf=\r\normer classmate, reports, =E2=80=9CWhen Bhagavan and I climbed up to the to=\r\np of\nArunachala, a thorn pricked my foot.Noting that I was lagging behind,\n=\r\nBhagavan removed it. A few yards later a big thorn pricked his foot. When I=\r\n\nlooked at his foot there were so many unremoved thorns in it. Then I\nexami=\r\nned the other foot, but the position was not different. =E2=80=98Which one =\r\nwill\nyou remove, the new thorn or the old ones?=E2=80=99, he queried. He br=\r\noke the thorn\nby pushing his foot to the ground and started walking again.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\n\nThere was no cooking in the Virupaksha Cave. Visitors used to b=\r\nring milk,\nfruits, cake and other food. Gradually more followers came to li=\r\nve with\nRamana and Palaniswami. Any food donated was always evenly distribu=\r\nted. But\nas it was not possible to rely on sufficient food for all being br=\r\nought by\nvisitors, Palaniswami and other devotees would go down to the town=\r\n to beg\nfor additional food. Then Ramana would mix up all the food donated,=\r\n make a\nmash by pouring hot water over it and gave each one a glassful.Ofte=\r\nn there\nwas not even any salt to flavour it, but Ramana\nthought it better t=\r\no be without than to beg anyone for it, =E2=80=9CIf once we begin\nto ask fo=\r\nr salt, we would feel like asking for dhal, and when we ask for\ndhal, we wo=\r\nuld feel like asking for payasam and so on. So we felt that we\nshould not a=\r\nsk for anything, and swallowed the gruel as it was. We used to\nfeel extreme=\r\nly happy over such diet.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe begging mission to town followed a f=\r\nix course. At least four of Ramana=E2=80=99s\ndevotees started on their way,=\r\n announcing their arri-val to the inhabitants\nby blowing their conches. The=\r\ny then went through the streets singing and\ncollecting what was given to th=\r\nem.\n\nSome days there was not enough of anything, on other days there was mo=\r\nre\nthan enough eatables. At times Ramana, so as not to disappoint anyone, e=\r\nnded\nup overeating. There is a well-known story of how one day he planned a=\r\n day\nof fasting and started off\nearly in the morning to walk alone on the h=\r\nill. There he met several women\nwho competed with each other to serve him f=\r\nood. He had to eat all that they\nserved him. Some hours later he met them a=\r\ngain and again they forced him to\neat. Then he lay down in a mantapam to sl=\r\neep. In the evening he wanted to\nreturn to the Virupaksha Cave when a devot=\r\nee met him, bringing him mangoes\ncooked in rasam. He ate this too. Jokingly=\r\n he said, =E2=80=9CIt is like the story of\nthe man who fled the town of mic=\r\ne and found himself in the land of tigers.=E2=80=9D\n\nSometimes people would=\r\n also send their carriages to pick him up for a meal.\nBut he always refused=\r\n, as he feared that if he accepted there would be no\nend to the invitations=\r\n.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016369207c693f3a6047f630947\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Soon after his mother and his b=\r\nrother returned home Sri Ramana left Pavalakkunru and moved up the hill.
