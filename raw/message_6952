(Desire =\r\ndid it ... Anger did it). We say this exactly once\nin atonement of sins. Li=\r\nke many things in sandhyAvandana, this is a\n&quot;technique&quot; that you can use.

Try saying it every time\nafter you realize that anger=\r\n controlled you. Then, after some time, try\nsaying it while you are mad. Th=\r\nen, after some time, try saying it just\nbefore you get mad. Using it this w=\r\nay, by saying this mantra 10 times\nthroughout the day is more useful than s=\r\naying it 100 times in a row each\nmorning.

Agni Sarma himself (Val=\r\nmiki&#39;s original\n&gt; name) is of Bharadwajasa Gotra, according to him!

Overcoming\n&gt; external weaknesses such as drinking, sm=\r\noking, drugs etc and internal\n&gt; weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc=\r\n, is the true sign of one&#39;s\n&gt; progress with a sadhana. You are definitely o=\r\nn the right path and keep\n&gt; going!\n&gt;\n&gt; As Vimalananda says, nature conspire=\r\ns to help one who truly wants to learn\n&gt; and do a sadhana!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt;\n&gt; As some people have already pointed out, one&#39;s varna is decided=\r\n by one&#39;s\n&gt; aptitude and attitude. Valmiki must&#39;ve been a great brahmin in =\r\nprevious\n&gt; lives, but some karmas made him take birth as a shoodra and even=\r\ntually his\n&gt; original samskaras took over and he became a brahmin, a rishi =\r\nand a\n&gt; maharshi. He even taught brahma jnana to Bharadwaja, one of the sap=\r\ntarshis!\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, if one is drawn to fire, does homam over a period o=\r\nf time and\n&gt; overcomes some weaknesses, obviously strong samskaras are pres=\r\nent from\n&gt; previous lives. If they are allowed to dominate, one will make p=\r\nrogress. One\n&gt; becomes a true brahmana with sadhana. As one realizes true k=\r\nnowledge\n&gt; internally, one may even become worthy of teaching spiritual kno=\r\nwledge to\n&gt; others, including brahmanas by birth!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Not only non-brahmins from India, but people not born in India/Hinduism =\r\nare\n&gt; doing homam regularly. Some of them are (will be) making great proges=\r\ns too.\n&gt; As a result, a strong Brahmin (true!) class will be established ac=\r\nross the\n&gt; world and that will increase dharma on earth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just yesterday=\r\n night, one Russian origin CS professor from Canada who was\n&gt; in Boston as =\r\na visiting scholar at MIT came to my house and learned homam.\n&gt; He did Gana=\r\npathi homam at my house with my help and plans to do it in\n&gt; Canada. He has=\r\n Jupiter in Pisces in 12th house and I got a nice feeling when\n&gt; he was doi=\r\nng homam. There were also several good omens, making me think he\n&gt; is relat=\r\nively well-prepared for sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; A dirty golden vessel is more valuable=\r\n than a brightly shining copper\n&gt; vessel that is gold-plated! You just need=\r\n to clean the former..\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; This homam movement is i=\r\nn nascent stages yet. Once a critical mass of\n&gt; sadhakas accumulates and pe=\r\nople start making progress, it will spread like a\n&gt; wildfire. There is no h=\r\nurry and there is need to feel pressure, for these\n&gt; things happen due to t=\r\nhe will of higher beings. We are all merely\n&gt; instruments.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tend to th=\r\nink that there are blessings of some great saints/yogis behind\n&gt; this. When=\r\n we did Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we casually\n&gt; selected=\r\n a muhurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that\n&gt; maha-poornah=\r\nuti happens on an Ashtami day. It was during this week that\n&gt; Manish receiv=\r\ned a command from the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and\n&gt; Manish to=\r\nok the sankalpa at the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna\n&gt; Parama=\r\nhamsa&#39;s lunar birthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time\n&gt; when t=\r\nhe angle between Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I\n&gt; started d=\r\naily homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the\n&gt; manua=\r\nls a few months later, there was another coincidence. It was exactly\n&gt; 120 =\r\nlunar years since Ramakrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a\n&gt; v=\r\nision of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of\n&gt; di=\r\nvine Mother, during that week of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in\n&gt; Chenn=\r\nai. I am not attached to forms and I rarely get visions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Several months=\r\n before that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that\n&gt; actually felt=\r\n real (i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong\n&gt; and pleas=\r\nant naad (buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through\n&gt; sushumn=\r\na during those days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was\n&gt; sitting=\r\n in front of the fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had\n&gt; never=\r\n seen before, sat in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga\n&gt; involving =\r\nfire and what yoga means etc. He taught several things in\n&gt; Sanskrit. Sudde=\r\nnly he changed into Manish. Then shakti came down, naad\n&gt; stopped, &quot;dream&quot; =\r\nended, and I was aware of my body lying on bed. The face of\n&gt; the person I =\r\nsaw was vivid in my mind. I did not know who it was. I\n&gt; mentioned this dre=\r\nam to Manish a week or two later. He said he did not know\n&gt; who it was, but=\r\n asked me a week later to check out the photo of a specific\n&gt; yogi. When I =\r\ndid a search on the internet, I found a photo (apparently the\n&gt; only photo =\r\navailable of that yogi). It looked very close to what I saw in my\n&gt; dream, =\r\nexcept that the person in my dream seemed like a slightly younger\n&gt; version=\r\n of that photo. This was a famous yogi from the parampara of\n&gt; Mahavatar Ba=\r\nbaji. As I had never seen his photo before that or read much\n&gt; about that l=\r\nineage or their teachings, his coming in my dream was strange.\n&gt; Also, teac=\r\nhing me some yoga involving fire was strange, because homam\n&gt; movement did =\r\nnot start then and I was not thinking of fire or fire ritual at\n&gt; all.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThere are some signs like this, which make me think that we are being used\n=\r\n&gt; as instruments in a big &quot;project&quot; designed by some great yogis in higher\n=\r\n&gt; realms. It seems to me like this project has an important purpose and wil=\r\nl\n&gt; help MANY people in their quest for god, in the coming decades and\n&gt; ce=\r\nnturies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;   =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                      Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jul 21, 2011 at 4:42 AM, srinivas wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;    Hi:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I am a non Brahmin, fortunately I came across Homam manuals/videos in\n&gt; in=\r\nternet.

Valmiki must&#39=\r\n;ve been a great brahmin in previous lives, but some karmas made him take b=\r\nirth as a shoodra and eventually his original samskaras took over and he be=\r\ncame a brahmin, a rishi and a maharshi.

If they =\r\nare allowed to dominate, one will make progress. One becomes a true brahman=\r\na with sadhana.

There is no hurry and there is need to fe=\r\nel pressure, for these things happen due to the will of higher beings.

When we did Sh=\r\nata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we casually selected a muhurta f=\r\nor the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that maha-poornahuti happens on=\r\n an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Manish received a command fro=\r\nm the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and Manish took the sankalpa at=\r\n the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s lunar bi=\r\nrthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time when the angle between S=\r\nun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I started daily homam about 5-6=\r\n months later, as a precursor to publishing the manuals a few months later,=\r\n there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 lunar years since Ramakr=\r\nishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a vision of Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine Mother, during that\n we=\r\nek of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I am not attached to form=\r\ns and I rarely get visions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Several months before t=\r\nhat, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real (i.e.=\r\n not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naad (buz=\r\nz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during those =\r\ndays. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front of the =\r\nfire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before, sat i=\r\nn front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what yoga me=\r\nans etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into Man=\r\nish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, and I wa=\r\ns aware of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in =\r\nmy mind. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week=\r\n or two later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week late=\r\nr to check out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the\n in=\r\nternet, I found a photo (apparently the only photo available of that yogi).=\r\n It looked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in =\r\nmy dream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a f=\r\namous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his =\r\nphoto before that or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his c=\r\noming in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire w=\r\nas strange, because homam movement did not start then and I was not thinkin=\r\ng of fire or fire ritual at all.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot;
