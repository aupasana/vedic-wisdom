If the pipe\nhas only bad balls, only bad balls co=\r\nme out. If it has both, any may\ncome out. If a bad ball comes out as soon a=\r\ns you throw a good ball in,\nit does not mean the ball you threw just now wa=\r\ns a bad ball.

However, even if one did a good ritual, still that good karma\nneed =\r\nnot give results immediately. It depends on how dense one&#39;s karma\npipeline =\r\nis. If a pipe has very small balls and a big heavy ball is\nthrown into it v=\r\nery fast, it may push through previous existing balls\nand come out quickly.=\r\n But, if a pipe has a lot of heavy balls, your\ncurrently thrown ball will b=\r\ne stuck behind them.
