Let us also, however, take th=\r\nis \nopportunity to renew our relationship with God, and to deepen our \ncomm=\r\nitment to the Dharma that is God&#39;s gift to us all.\n\nDevotion to Sri Krishna=\r\n is not meant to be practiced only one day a \nyear, but is in actuality our=\r\n soul&#39;s inner-most yearning and need.  \nWe must aspire to show our devotion=\r\n to Sri Krishna each day of the \nyear, each moment of every day, and with t=\r\nhe utter-most depths of our \nbeing.\n\nDevotion is not merely sentiment.  Dev=\r\notion is action=85action in pure \nlove.  To show our devotion to Sri Krishn=\r\na, let us use this \nopportunity of His appearance day to resolve now to alw=\r\nays put Him \nfirst in our lives, to read and study His sacred words in His =\r\n\nBhagavad Gita each and every day, to follow and incorporate His \nteachings=\r\n in our daily lives, and to be the very best bhaktas that we \ncan be.  \n\nAb=\r\nove all, let us sincerely pray at the lotus feet of Bhagavan Sri \nKrishna t=\r\nhat He will empower each and every one of us that we may \nserve Him and tha=\r\nt we may help to revive Dharma in this world.  \n\nLet us make every day Sri =\r\nKrishna Janmashtami.  If we do so, Sri \nKrishna will appear in our hearts n=\r\not just once a year, but every \nmoment of our lives, to bless us and to bes=\r\ntow the gift of His grace \nupon us.  May all sentient beings enjoy a blesse=\r\nd and joyous Sri \nKrishna Janmashtami on this sacred day.\n\n\nJaya Bhagavan S=\r\nri Krishna,\n\nJaya Sriman Narayana,\n\nSanatana Dharma Jayate,\n\n\nSri Dharma Pr=\r\navartaka Acharya\n(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)\n\nPresident-Acharya\nInternationa=\r\nl Sanatana Dharma Society\n\nResident Acharya\nHindu Temple of Nebraska, USA\n\n=\r\n\n\nwww.dharmacentral.com\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/drmoraleslist/\n\n\n\n"}}
