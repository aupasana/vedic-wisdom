But there is this difference\nbetween dream and =\r\nthe waking state. In dream I see my friends or relations\nand go through som=\r\ne experiences with them. When I wake up and ask those\nfriends or relations =\r\nwhom I met in the dream about the dream, they know\nnothing about it. But in=\r\n the waking state what I see and hear is\ncorroborated by so many others.\n\nB=\r\nhagavan Ramana replied:\n\nYou should not mix up the dream and the waking sta=\r\ntes.Just as you seek\ncorroboration about the waking state experiences from =\r\nthose whom you see in\nthe waking state,you must ask for corroboration about=\r\n the dream experiences\nfrom those whom you saw in the dream state, i.e. whe=\r\nn you wre in the\ndream.Then in the dream, those friends and relations whom =\r\nyou saw in the\ndream wuld corroborate you.\n\nThe main point is, are you prep=\r\nared when awake to affirm the reality of any\nof your dream experiences? Sim=\r\nilarly, one who has awakened into Jnana cannot\naffirm the reality of the wa=\r\nking experience.From his view point, the waking\nstate is dream.&quot;\n\nThe visit=\r\nor pursued:\n\nIt is said only some are chosenm for Self Realization and thos=\r\ne alone would\nget it. It is rather discouraging.\n\nBhagavan Ramana further c=\r\nlarified:\n\nAll that is meant is, we cannot achieve Realization of Self by o=\r\nur own\n&#39;buddhi&#39; - intellect, unaided by God&#39;s grace.\n\nSource: Arunachala&#39;s =\r\nRamana.Boundless Ocean of Grace.Volume 5.
