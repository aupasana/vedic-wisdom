Then churn it and the\nbutter will rise. Similarly the neophyte should sit in solitude and not be\ndisturbed by worldly-minded people; then through the churning of the settled\nmind by the practice of meditation the butter of Divine Love will be\nacquired.\n\nIf you give your mind to God in solitude, you will obtain the spirit of true\nrenunciation and absolute devotion. If you give the same mind to the world,\nit will grow worldly and think of woman and gold. The world may be likened\nto water, and the mind to milk. Pure milk once mixed with water cannot be\nseparated from it; but if it is first turned into butter and then placed in\nwater, it can remain separate.\n\nLet the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of Divine Love by means\nof religious practices in solitude. The mind then will never get mixed with\nthe water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain unattached to the\nworld. Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind will stand apart\nfrom the world.\n\nSource: THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--000e0cd1398a80143704805451bf\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIf you want butter, you must curdle the milk and set it in a pla=\r\nce where no one can disturb it; otherwise the curd will not stand.
