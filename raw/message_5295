Bhatla &lt;astrologytree@...=\r\n&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sat, November 20, 2010 1:10:21 AM\n=\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] On Ego (Re: Success with Mantras)\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste,=\r\n\n\nRespected Bhupendra Ji, I am sorry for replying late. I was not able to \n=\r\nunderstand what points you are making so it took time to understand what yo=\r\nu are \nsaying. \n\n\nsir, below are some words which constitute my thinking. w=\r\nith deep regards i want \nto share them here with a hope that they may answe=\r\nr your questions. Please \nforgive me for my mistakes.\n\n1) Regarding behavio=\r\nur and thinking of Vimlananda and other Rishis, i honestly \nadmit that I do=\r\n not understand properly why they do what they do. This is \nbecause I am no=\r\nt able enough to reach that level of intelligence. But when it \ncomes to Vi=\r\nmalananda, when I try to understand why they are doing so, I always \nrefer =\r\nto his saying that he wanted to die with a clean karma account. Here clean =\r\n\nmeans &#39;empty&#39;. \n\n\nSecond, he usually said that it is best to exist at two =\r\nlevels of conciousness \nat the same time(Forgive me for wrong words). like =\r\nwhen he is playing chess with \nRobert at the same time he is wandering at h=\r\nigher level of conciousness, without \nanyone realising that what he is thin=\r\nking.\n\nSo, i assume that whatever he did was because of above two principle=\r\ns which he \nwas always aware of. Whether he was interrupting TV Signal or m=\r\nessing with Sadhu \nat his cave or any other incidence. \n\n\nAt the end, he ga=\r\nve his life for saving son of one of his disciples without even \nletting th=\r\nem know. \n\nI may never be able to understand why Vimalananda did what he di=\r\nd. \n\nWhat I think of Vimalananda is that he was a great Soul. Who have some=\r\n \nrinanubandha left in this world along with some conditioning. so he came =\r\nto pay \nthem and to remove those conditioning. And I think that he has agai=\r\nn taken birth \nin this world to repay some more of his left rinanubandha.\n\n=\r\nI believe Manish Ji is also a Soul of same caliber and he is one who is nit=\r\nya \nsiddha soul. And he is here to just repay his rinanubandha and to help =\r\nothers \nevolve.\n\nRaman Maharishi used to eat pan daily after every lunch be=\r\nfore going on a walk. \nonce his disciple became late for bringing the Paan.=\r\n Ramana Maharishi waited for \nabout 10-15 minutes and when disciple didnt a=\r\nrrived he went on his walk. but \nafter that he never ate Paan. This can be =\r\ninterpreted as his ego or his \nrealisation that he was attached to Paan so =\r\nhe quit a thing which he was \nattached to.\n\n2) Second thing you pointed out=\r\n about &quot;pre-requisite&quot; of sadhna. what i think is \nthat Pre-requisite of sa=\r\ndhna is just &quot;want to do sadhna&quot;\n\nWhile Sadhna it self is a pre-requsite to=\r\n reach god (or to attain Moksha or any \nother objective)\n\nControlling anger=\r\n, greed etc; to remove conditioning of mind and to empty our \n&#39;Karma-fruit =\r\naccount balance&#39;. These all three constitute sadhna. Process which \nconstit=\r\nute doing all the above things is sadhna. \n\nControlling anger etc are not p=\r\nre-requisite of saadhna, but controlling them \nitself is saadhna.\n\nWhen we =\r\nachieve them, we attain the moksha or what ever objectives we have. If \nwe =\r\nhaven&#39;t achieved them yet, it means our Sadhna is incomplete. \n\n\nNow whethe=\r\nr Vimlananda or Rishis were angry because of their incomplete sadhna \nor be=\r\ncause of Divine will, I can not judge. Even if they were incomplete, Still =\r\n\nthey were lot lot better than me and I need to respect them and learn from=\r\n them.\n\nUdhav ji had Brahmgyana. He was one of few persons who, in their li=\r\nving \nconciousness realised that Shri Krishna is God Himself. But still he =\r\nhad some \nego left in him. So Shri Krishna taught him lessons in his own wa=\r\ny. And even \nafter Lord Krishna left his Body, Udhav had to do Tapasya for =\r\nmany many years to \nachieve ultimate stage.\n\n3) Third thing was about saadh=\r\nna and Sidhis.\n\nThere are numerous paths for reaching God or we should say =\r\nthat there are many \npaths for doing Sadhnas. Many in Hinduism itself, In s=\r\nikhism, in Islam, Budhism \netc etc all are paths for doing Saadhna. These a=\r\nll paths are different. But \nstill they take us to same objective.\n\nThese a=\r\nll paths have two things in common.\n\na) Mind Training\nb) Surrender to God.\n=\r\n\nIn most of the Paths one is more prominent other is less prominent. Like i=\r\nn \nbhakti Yoga, Surrender to god is given utmost important but Mind Trainin=\r\ng is to \nsome extent only. While in Rajyoga or Hath Yoga Mind training is g=\r\niven more \nimportant and Surrender is to some extent.\nIn Karma yoga, Mind i=\r\ns trained in a different way using different methods and in \nGyan yoga Mind=\r\n is trained in different way using different methods.\n\nTantra is a saadhna =\r\nmethod where both Mind training and Surrender are given \nequal importance a=\r\nnd both these are done in a very aggressive and fast manner. \nSo it works v=\r\nery fast. \n\n\nMind Training part of Saadhna, produces lot of energy in us. m=\r\nany names are \ngiven to this energy. This energy is what gives Siddhis. \n\nS=\r\no on quest to find God, these Sidhis are just by-products or I term them as=\r\n \n&quot;side effects&quot; for my own reference. They are not our aim when we are try=\r\ning to \nreach God. We do not need sidhis but still they are produced. When =\r\nVivekananda \nwas offered sidhis by His Guru he refused to accept them as hi=\r\ns guru \nacknowledged that these sidhis will not help him in achieving god. =\r\nAlthough at \nlater stage Vivekananda achieved lot of Sidhis by himself.\n\nWh=\r\nat I want to point here is that For achieving Sidhis, 2nd aspect of surrend=\r\ner \nis not needed. One can achieve Sidhis by following some methods but the=\r\ny will \nnot help him reach God. They just add to his Karma-Fruit account an=\r\nd take aways \nfrom God.\n\nIn the book &quot;Concentration - By Mouni sadhu&quot;, Auth=\r\nor explains simple techniques \nto achieve some simple sidhis step by step. =\r\nHe also adds that one need not to \nbelieve in God to attain these sidhis. B=\r\nut if he use these sidhis in Quest for \nGod these can be helpful. \n\n\nSo a p=\r\nerson who had controlled his mind and trained his mind to achieve some \npow=\r\ners does not mean that he has controlled his anger etc and has a love for \n=\r\nGod.\n\nBut for Vimalananda and other Rishis, I believe that he was a person =\r\nwho had \ncontrol on most of his instincts including anger. Although his lev=\r\nel of \nintelligence and concious was so much different from us that we may =\r\nnot be able \nto understand why he did so.\n\nI am sorry for stretching this m=\r\nail too long. I hope some of your points were \naddressed in this mail.\n\nple=\r\nase pardon for my mistakes\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha R=\r\nao Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I do understand that you are saying that it is important to eff=\r\nace once ego for \n&gt;\n&gt; success in sadhana and while I read and Vimalananada&#39;=\r\ns book and do like him for \n&gt;\n&gt; what he was able to achieve, I still see eg=\r\no in him when he disrupts TV \n&gt; transmission of of an interview where is he=\r\n not rightly acknowledged or killing \n&gt;\n&gt; another sadhu for taking a space =\r\nhe prefers for meditation in a cave. I also \n&gt;see \n&gt;\n&gt; ego in his Senior Gu=\r\nru Maharaj for cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of \n&gt; illness for not b=\r\neing given audience and I see ego in them in much the same way \n&gt;\n&gt; you and=\r\n other people see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high \n&gt; cal=\r\niber. Yet people burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his \n=\r\n&gt; actions identified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon=\r\n. \n&gt; Robert Svoboda puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so we see =\r\nonly \n&gt; positive in him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by some scriptur=\r\nes and we \n&gt;see \n&gt;\n&gt; only bad in him, yet he was a very powerful sadhaka th=\r\nan Vimalanada or his \n&gt; senior guru maharaja for sure. So why cannot we see=\r\n Ravana&#39;s action as divine \n&gt; play and stop Ravana dahan on dussera? And if=\r\n we see Ravana as egoisitic, then \n\n&gt; for sure why the incidents I mention =\r\nfrom Vimalanada&#39;s book cannot be seen in a \n&gt;\n&gt; similar way. But htese are =\r\nall great sadhak and were greatly successful in \n&gt; whatever they tried to a=\r\nchieve from their sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not very well versed with scriptures s=\r\no I find it hard to quote from them \n\n&gt; or remember all the names, but do y=\r\nou remember a rishi from the Mahabharata who \n&gt;\n&gt; was pleaded to Duryodhana=\r\n to pay a visit pandavas in the forest. This rishi was \n&gt;\n&gt; very pleased by=\r\n the hospitality shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi was well \n&gt; known for =\r\nhis temper and often feared by people. It is exactly for this reason \n\n&gt; wh=\r\ny Duryodhana invited this rishi to his palace and provided him with all \n&gt; =\r\nhospitality so that he could convince this rishi to pay visit to panadavas =\r\nwho \n\n&gt; would not be able to accomodate the rishi this lavishly and therefo=\r\nre would \n&gt;have \n&gt;\n&gt; to suffer his curse.If this rishi was so temperamental=\r\n, how was he so succesful \n&gt;\n&gt; in his sadhana? I read so frequently=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0about the need to give up anger for \n&gt;success \n&gt;\n&gt; in sadhana.=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0This apparently does not seem=C3=82=C2=A0to apply to=C3=82=C2=A0this =\r\nrishi. He was \n&gt; successful regardless. Vimalanada&#39;s book also mentions tha=\r\nt this rishi was \n&gt;later \n&gt;\n&gt; punished by Lord Visnu and had 10,000 years o=\r\nf his tapasya fruits taken away \n&gt; from him. If everything that these rishi=\r\n&#39;s do has to be identified with their \n&gt; deity and therefore cannot be faul=\r\nted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not saying that I sho=\r\nuld not change my svabhau to achieve success in \n&gt; sadhana. It is never nic=\r\ne to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is \n&gt; certainly not easy to c=\r\nhange once nature either. we can only hope that chnage \n&gt;in \n&gt;\n&gt; svabhau ca=\r\nn be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not going to be \n&gt; success=\r\nful in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svabhau, and if \n&gt;we=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; do not have the strength to change ourselves, basically based on what=\r\n you are \n&gt; saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am not tryin=\r\ng to start an \n&gt; argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see ego in al=\r\nl the poeple of the \n&gt; stories I mentioned and all of them are about great =\r\nsadhaks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly that link to the=C3=82=C2=A0post=C3=82=C2=A0regarding =\r\nManish is very interesting. You did \n&gt;not \n&gt;\n&gt; send this to me before. You =\r\ndid make a mention though about Vimalanada Aghora \n&gt; series of books, and i=\r\nn the same message, you mentioned someone who was able to \n&gt;\n&gt; achieve spec=\r\nifioc results from specific sadhana&#39;s by reading this book. That is \n&gt;\n&gt; wh=\r\nat drew my attention to that book and finally made me join this yahoo group=\r\n \n&gt;as \n&gt;\n&gt; a way to get in touch with you. It could be that your message ha=\r\nd gone to the \n&gt; SPAM folder.You are very fortunate to have met him and=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0have his guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I am on this subject of success in s=\r\nadhana, I do the Super Short version \n\n&gt; of the homa on a=C3=82=C2=A0weekly=\r\n basis. As I read and try to learn the regular version, \n&gt;I \n&gt;\n&gt; see that i=\r\nt makes use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you in \n&gt; Boston, =\r\nwe have a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass let \n&gt; alon=\r\ne darbha during the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you grow them in=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; a pot? If so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? You =\r\nalso \n&gt; mention that one should not be looking for specific results from on=\r\nce sadhana. \n\n&gt; Before the commencement of the sadhana or homa, what should=\r\n one declare as the \n\n&gt; motive in such a case? I have to tell you here that=\r\n I cannot lie about my \n&gt; intentions to God. And=C3=82=C2=A0if I do, I will=\r\n probably keep thinking about it for the \n&gt;\n&gt; duration of the sadhana and t=\r\nhe whole experience gioes to waste as the mind is \n\n&gt; not at ease.=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0How about when one is not clear about the specific reasons f=\r\nor \n\n&gt; doing homa or sadhana but you were doing it for a specific purpose b=\r\nut now with \n&gt;\n&gt; purpose met, you are directionless but realise the signifi=\r\ncance of sadhana or \n&gt; homa, feel good doing it=C3=82=C2=A0and do not want =\r\nto give up? Is it important to \n&gt;declare \n&gt;\n&gt; a motive before commencing sa=\r\ndhana?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________=\r\n____\n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n\n&gt; Cc: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thu, November 18, 2010 2=\r\n:52:06 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Ego (Re: Success with Mantras)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me add my 2 cents of perspective =\r\non your nice observations.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not illust=\r\nrate a picture of people who were\n&gt; &gt; compassionate and always willing to f=\r\norgive and forget.\n&gt; \n&gt; Forgiving and forgetting is not necessarily saattwi=\r\nk, when it is the work of a \n\n&gt; dense ego. For example, one may do it to lo=\r\nok good or impress others. \n&gt;Similarly, \n&gt;\n&gt; hurting someone is not necessa=\r\nrily taamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a \n\n&gt; light ego. For example=\r\n, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his \n&gt; foot was a divine=\r\n drama for a higher purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Copying the actions of divine beings requ=\r\nires some intelligence. To borrow an \n&gt; idiom from my mother tongue, a fox =\r\ndoes not become a tiger if it paints stripes \n&gt;\n&gt; on its body.\n&gt; \n&gt; People =\r\nyou are talking about are very high level beings. Those who efface their \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; ego and start to self-identify with some higher deities will start to ex=\r\nhibit \n&gt; the nature of those deities. Their actions may be fierce at times,=\r\n but their \n&gt; purpose will be divine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether one wants liberation or =\r\none wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga \n&gt; (oneness) of a deity or whatev=\r\ner one wants, the first step is to efface ego. \n&gt;All \n&gt;\n&gt; sadhanas are mean=\r\nt for that only. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or \n&gt; someone else=\r\n achieved, the starting point is to efface your ego through \n&gt;sadhana. \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n As you make progress, at some stage, you may start seeing some results.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nobody here I\n&gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repe=\r\nating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; &gt; particular mantra....but certianly w=\r\nhat is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; &gt; produces results that are easily =\r\nnoticeable to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable=\r\n results if one is thinking \n&gt;\n&gt; of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must=\r\n score a century today&quot; is unlikely \n&gt;to \n&gt;\n&gt; score a century. The best str=\r\nategy is to take it a ball at a time and focus. \n&gt; Similarly, best strategy=\r\n in sadhana is to stop thinking about results and just \n\n&gt; focusing on the =\r\n&quot;here and now&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, liberation is not ruled out even in this age=\r\n. Ramakrishna said that \n&gt;he \n&gt;\n&gt; would come back a century later and that =\r\npeople would be liberated en masse in \n\n&gt; that birth. Even in these times, =\r\nit is possible to be liberated.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhupendra ji, here is a mai=\r\nl I sent before you joined this list.

Similarly when \n&gt;Robert\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV interview, Vimalana=\r\nnda \n&gt; goes\n&gt; &gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his reasons for not=\r\n acknowledging \n&gt;him.\n&gt; &gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw attention to hims=\r\nelf and secondly he was\n&gt; &gt; sick,=C3=82=C2=A0and that was the reason why Ro=\r\nbert did not acknowledge any help he \nhad\n&gt; &gt; received from Vimalananda - t=\r\no avoid people crowding at his door, but\n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda could not be pacif=\r\nied and had the TV transmission disabled at \nthe\n&gt; &gt; time the interview was=\r\n going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking\n&gt; &gt; acknowledgement even wh=\r\nen he claims he does not like public attention! \n&gt; Probably\n&gt; &gt; transmissio=\r\nn breaking down was again part of divine will you think? Robert\n&gt; &gt; Sbvobod=\r\na himself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing with \n&gt;Vimalananda\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; was impossible especially when one knows he is wrong but will never admi=\r\nt to \n\n&gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; mistake.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then there was the story of his Senior G=\r\nuru Maharaj has was denied audience \n&gt;by \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; sick sadhu. The senior=\r\n guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curses this \n&gt;ill\n&gt; &gt; sadhu with l=\r\nifetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally succumbs to that \n\n&gt; &gt;and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am denied audience, do I curse =\r\nthem \n\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; death?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not illustrat=\r\ne a picture of people who were\n&gt; &gt; compassionate and always willing to forg=\r\nive and forget. But still, they were\n&gt; &gt; hugely successful in their sadhana=\r\n in their own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; &gt; talking about here....the pr=\r\ne-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n&gt; &gt; thinks expects to ache=\r\nive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; &gt; particular mantra=\r\n....but certianly what is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; &gt; produces resul=\r\nts that are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling \n&gt; &gt;though\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those\n&gt; &gt; pre-r=\r\nequisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and \n&gt; contin=\r\nue\n&gt; &gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C3=82=C2=A0gradually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;those\n&gt; &gt; channels are not clean then that energy flow can create unplea=\r\nsant \n&gt;experiences\n&gt; &gt; like increased anger, lust etc. and opposite if chan=\r\nnels are clean enough.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rishis have clean channels and they flow alo=\r\nng with divine will. curses and\n&gt; &gt; blessings they give are just part of di=\r\nvine will. like curse given to lord\n&gt; &gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to r=\r\namayana. similarly curses given to yadav\n&gt; &gt; vansh and king prikshit played=\r\n an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy\n&gt; &gt; except few times when he =\r\nwas markedly irritated.Like in an incidence where \n&gt;one\n&gt; &gt; of his female d=\r\nisciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in front \nof\n&gt; &gt; him to =\r\nlearn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; student did not learnt well what he taught to her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On o=\r\nther side people with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be \n&gt; a=\r\nble\n&gt; &gt; to handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger lust=\r\n etc. \nlike\n&gt; &gt; ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning.

I was not able to understand what points you are maki=\r\nng so it took time to understand what you are saying. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;sir, below ar=\r\ne some words which constitute my thinking. with deep regards i want to shar=\r\ne them here with a hope that they may answer your questions. Please forgive=\r\n me for my mistakes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Regarding behaviour and thinking of Vimlanan=\r\nda and other Rishis, i honestly admit that I do not understand properly why=\r\n they do what they do. This is because I am not able enough to reach that l=\r\nevel of intelligence. But when it comes to Vimalananda, when I try to under=\r\nstand why they are doing so, I always refer to his saying that he wanted to=\r\n die with a clean karma account. Here clean means &#39;empty&#39;. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Second, =\r\nhe usually said that it is best to exist at two levels of conciousness at t=\r\nhe same time(Forgive me for wrong words). like when he is playing chess wit=\r\nh Robert at the\n same time he is wandering at higher level of conciousness,=\r\n without anyone realising that what he is thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, i assume tha=\r\nt whatever he did was because of above two principles which he was always a=\r\nware of. Whether he was interrupting TV Signal or messing with Sadhu at his=\r\n cave or any other incidence. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the end, he gave his life for savi=\r\nng son of one of his disciples without even letting them know. &lt;BR&gt;I may ne=\r\nver be able to understand why Vimalananda did what he did. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What I t=\r\nhink of Vimalananda is that he was a great Soul. Who have some rinanubandha=\r\n left in this world along with some conditioning. so he came to pay them an=\r\nd to remove those conditioning. And I think that he has again taken birth i=\r\nn this world to repay some more of his left rinanubandha.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I believe =\r\nManish Ji is also a Soul of same caliber and he is one who is nitya siddha =\r\nsoul. And he is here to just repay his rinanubandha and to help others\n evo=\r\nlve.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raman Maharishi used to eat pan daily after every lunch before =\r\ngoing on a walk. once his disciple became late for bringing the Paan. Raman=\r\na Maharishi waited for about 10-15 minutes and when disciple didnt arrived =\r\nhe went on his walk. but after that he never ate Paan. This can be interpre=\r\nted as his ego or his realisation that he was attached to Paan so he quit a=\r\n thing which he was attached to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Second thing you pointed out abo=\r\nut &quot;pre-requisite&quot; of sadhna. what i think is that Pre-requisite of sadhna =\r\nis just &quot;want to do sadhna&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While Sadhna it self is a pre-requsite t=\r\no reach god (or to attain Moksha or any other objective)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Controlling=\r\n anger, greed etc; to remove conditioning of mind and to empty our &#39;Karma-f=\r\nruit account balance&#39;. These all three constitute sadhna. Process which con=\r\nstitute doing all the above things is sadhna. &lt;BR&gt;Controlling anger etc are=\r\n not pre-requisite of saadhna, but controlling them itself is\n saadhna.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;When we achieve them, we attain the moksha or what ever objectives we h=\r\nave. If we haven&#39;t achieved them yet, it means our Sadhna is incomplete. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now whether Vimlananda or Rishis were angry because of their incomple=\r\nte sadhna or because of Divine will, I can not judge. Even if they were inc=\r\nomplete, Still they were lot lot better than me and I need to respect them =\r\nand learn from them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Udhav ji had Brahmgyana. He was one of few pers=\r\nons who, in their living conciousness realised that Shri Krishna is God Him=\r\nself. But still he had some ego left in him. So Shri Krishna taught him les=\r\nsons in his own way. And even after Lord Krishna left his Body, Udhav had t=\r\no do Tapasya for many many years to achieve ultimate stage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) Third=\r\n thing was about saadhna and Sidhis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are numerous paths for re=\r\naching God or we should say that there are many paths for doing Sadhnas. Ma=\r\nny in Hinduism itself, In sikhism, in Islam, Budhism\n etc etc all are paths=\r\n for doing Saadhna. These all paths are different. But still they take us t=\r\no same objective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These all paths have two things in common.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\na) Mind Training&lt;BR&gt;b) Surrender to God.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In most of the Paths one is=\r\n more prominent other is less prominent. Like in bhakti Yoga, Surrender to =\r\ngod is given utmost important but Mind Training is to some extent only. Whi=\r\nle in Rajyoga or Hath Yoga Mind training is given more important and Surren=\r\nder is to some extent.&lt;BR&gt;In Karma yoga, Mind is trained in a different way=\r\n using different methods and in Gyan yoga Mind is trained in different way =\r\nusing different methods.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tantra is a saadhna method where both Mind =\r\ntraining and Surrender are given equal importance and both these are done i=\r\nn a very aggressive and fast manner. So it works very fast. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mind Tr=\r\naining part of Saadhna, produces lot of energy in us. many names are given =\r\nto this energy. This energy is what gives\n Siddhis. &lt;BR&gt;So on quest to find=\r\n God, these Sidhis are just by-products or I term them as &quot;side effects&quot; fo=\r\nr my own reference. They are not our aim when we are trying to reach God. W=\r\ne do not need sidhis but still they are produced. When Vivekananda was offe=\r\nred sidhis by His Guru he refused to accept them as his guru acknowledged t=\r\nhat these sidhis will not help him in achieving god. Although at later stag=\r\ne Vivekananda achieved lot of Sidhis by himself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What I want to poin=\r\nt here is that For achieving Sidhis, 2nd aspect of surrender is not needed.=\r\n One can achieve Sidhis by following some methods but they will not help hi=\r\nm reach God. They just add to his Karma-Fruit account and take aways from G=\r\nod.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the book &quot;Concentration - By Mouni sadhu&quot;, Author explains si=\r\nmple techniques to achieve some simple sidhis step by step. He also adds th=\r\nat one need not to believe in God to attain these sidhis. But if he use the=\r\nse sidhis in Quest for God these\n can be helpful. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So a person who h=\r\nad controlled his mind and trained his mind to achieve some powers does not=\r\n mean that he has controlled his anger etc and has a love for God.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B=\r\nut for Vimalananda and other Rishis, I believe that he was a person who had=\r\n control on most of his instincts including anger. Although his level of in=\r\ntelligence and concious was so much different from us that we may not be ab=\r\nle to understand why he did so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am sorry for stretching this mail =\r\ntoo long. I hope some of your points were addressed in this mail.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;pl=\r\nease pardon for my mistakes&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;Atul&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&lt;/A&gt;, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nNamaste Narasimha Rao Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do understand that you are say=\r\ning that it is important to efface\n once ego for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; success in sadhan=\r\na and while I read and Vimalananada&#39;s book and do like him for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wha=\r\nt he was able to achieve, I still see ego in him when he disrupts TV &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; transmission of of an interview where is he not rightly acknowledged or =\r\nkilling &lt;BR&gt;&gt; another sadhu for taking a space he prefers for meditation=\r\n in a cave. I also see &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ego in his Senior Guru Maharaj for cursing =\r\nthe ailing sadhu to lifetime of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; illness for not being given audien=\r\nce and I see ego in them in much the same way &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you and other people=\r\n see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high &lt;BR&gt;&gt; caliber. Y=\r\net people burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n actions identified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Robert Svoboda puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so we=\r\n see only &lt;BR&gt;&gt; positive in him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by so=\r\nme scriptures and we see\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; only bad in him, yet he was a very power=\r\nful sadhaka than Vimalanada or his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; senior guru maharaja for sure. =\r\nSo why cannot we see Ravana&#39;s action as divine &lt;BR&gt;&gt; play and stop Ravan=\r\na dahan on dussera? And if we see Ravana as egoisitic, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for su=\r\nre why the incidents I mention from Vimalanada&#39;s book cannot be seen in a &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; similar way. But htese are all great sadhak and were greatly succes=\r\nsful in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; whatever they tried to achieve from their sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not very well versed with scriptures so I find it hard to qu=\r\note from them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; or remember all the names, but do you remember a ris=\r\nhi from the Mahabharata who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was pleaded to Duryodhana to pay a vis=\r\nit pandavas in the forest. This rishi was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; very pleased by the hosp=\r\nitality shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi was well &lt;BR&gt;&gt; known for his=\r\n temper and often feared by people. It is exactly for this reason &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nwhy Duryodhana\n invited this rishi to his palace and provided him with all =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hospitality so that he could convince this rishi to pay visit to p=\r\nanadavas who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would not be able to accomodate the rishi this lavish=\r\nly and therefore would have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to suffer his curse.If this rishi was =\r\nso temperamental, how was he so succesful &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in his sadhana? I read s=\r\no frequently=C3=82&nbsp;about the need to give up anger for success &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; in sadhana.=C3=82&nbsp;This apparently does not seem=C3=82&nbsp;to apply =\r\nto=C3=82&nbsp;this rishi. He was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; successful regardless. Vimalanada=\r\n&#39;s book also mentions that this rishi was later &lt;BR&gt;&gt; punished by Lord V=\r\nisnu and had 10,000 years of his tapasya fruits taken away &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from hi=\r\nm. If everything that these rishi&#39;s do has to be identified with their &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; deity and therefore cannot be faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to puni=\r\nsh him?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not saying that I should not change my svabha=\r\nu to achieve success in\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana. It is never nice to be too tempe=\r\nramental of egositic, but it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; certainly not easy to change once =\r\nnature either. we can only hope that chnage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; svabhau can be brou=\r\nght about by our sadhana, but if we are not going to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; successful=\r\n in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svabhau, and if we &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; do not have the strength to change ourselves, basically based on what =\r\nyou are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am not =\r\ntrying to start an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; argument here, but I simply do not get it. I se=\r\ne ego in all the poeple of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; stories I mentioned and all of them=\r\n are about great sadhaks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lastly that link to the=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;post=C3=82&nbsp;regarding Manish is very interesting. You did not &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; send this to me before. You did make a mention though about Vimalanada A=\r\nghora &lt;BR&gt;&gt; series of books, and in the same message, you mentioned some=\r\none who was able to\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; achieve specifioc results from specific sadha=\r\nna&#39;s by reading this book. That is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what drew my attention to that =\r\nbook and finally made me join this yahoo group as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a way to get in =\r\ntouch with you. It could be that your message had gone to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; SPAM=\r\n folder.You are very fortunate to have met him and=C3=82&nbsp;have his guid=\r\nance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; While I am on this subject of success in sadhana, I =\r\ndo the Super Short version &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the homa on a=C3=82&nbsp;weekly basi=\r\ns. As I read and try to learn the regular version, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; see that it m=\r\nakes use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bosto=\r\nn, we have a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass let &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; alone darbha during the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you gro=\r\nw them in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a pot? If so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow=\r\n darbha? You also &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mention that one should not be looking for speci=\r\nfic results from once\n sadhana. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before the commencement of the sad=\r\nhana or homa, what should one declare as the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; motive in such a case=\r\n? I have to tell you here that I cannot lie about my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; intentions to=\r\n God. And=C3=82&nbsp;if I do, I will probably keep thinking about it for th=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; duration of the sadhana and the whole experience gioes to waste =\r\nas the mind is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not at ease.=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;How about when =\r\none is not clear about the specific reasons for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; doing homa or sadh=\r\nana but you were doing it for a specific purpose but now with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; purp=\r\nose met, you are directionless but realise the significance of sadhana or &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; homa, feel good doing it=C3=82&nbsp;and do not want to give up?

For example, one may do it to look good or impre=\r\nss others. Similarly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hurting someone is not necessarily taamasik/=\r\nraajasik, when it is a result of a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; light ego. For example, Maharsh=\r\ni Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the\n chest with his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; foot was a divine d=\r\nrama for a higher purpose.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Copying the actions of divine b=\r\neings requires some intelligence.

Those who efface their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ego and start to self-identify with =\r\nsome higher deities will start to exhibit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the nature of those deit=\r\nies. Their actions may be fierce at times, but their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; purpose will =\r\nbe divine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whether one wants liberation or one wants saayu=\r\njya (togetherness) or yoga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (oneness) of a deity or whatever one wa=\r\nnts, the first step is to efface ego. All &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhanas are meant for t=\r\nhat only. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone else =\r\nachieved, the starting point is to efface your ego through sadhana. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; As you make progress,\n at some stage, you may start seeing some results.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nobody here I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thi=\r\nnks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required such that ou=\r\nr sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable result=\r\ns if one is thinking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must sc=\r\nore a century today&quot; is unlikely to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; score a century. The best stra=\r\ntegy is to take it a ball at a time and focus. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, best str=\r\nategy in sadhana is to stop thinking about results and just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; focusi=\r\nng on the &quot;here and now&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Moreover, liberation is not rule=\r\nd out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would come back a=\r\n century later and that people would be liberated en masse in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that=\r\n birth. Even in\n these times, it is possible to be liberated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you j=\r\noined this list. Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; considers himself a spiritual son of Vimal=\r\nananda and has a similar nature. I am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; privately aware of some inci=\r\ndents similar to what you described below with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalananda. Howeve=\r\nr, the essence of Manish&#39;s mesage is to do sadhana and efface &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ego,=\r\n i.e. what I wrote above.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best r=\r\negards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, =\r\nFree Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jy=\r\notish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste Atul Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vimalananda certainly seem=\r\ns like a cool person when we read about him but to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;say&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; that sometimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not=\r\n learn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is an understatement. Do you recall a=\r\nn instance from his book when he\n goes to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; cave to p=\r\nerform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? After a brief&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C3=82&nbsp;he dies! Simila=\r\nrly when Robert&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during=\r\n a TV interview, Vimalananda &lt;BR&gt;&gt; goes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mad inspite of Robe=\r\nrt trying to explain his reasons for not acknowledging him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vi=\r\nmalanada did not like to draw attention to himself and secondly he was&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; sick,=C3=82&nbsp;and that was the reason why Robert did not acknow=\r\nledge any help he had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; received from Vimalananda - to avoid peo=\r\nple crowding at his door, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vimalananda could not be pacifie=\r\nd and had the TV transmission disabled at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time the intervi=\r\new was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; acknowle=\r\ndgement even when he claims he does not like public attention! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pro=\r\nbably&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; transmission\n breaking down was again part of divine wil=\r\nl you think? Robert&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sbvoboda himself mentions in the opening c=\r\nhapter that dealing with Vimalananda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was impossible especially=\r\n when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;his&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; mistake.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Then there was the story of his S=\r\nenior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\nick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curses this i=\r\nll&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally=\r\n succumbs to that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dies! Now if I like to meet=\r\n somebody and am denied audience, do I curse them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ndeath?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not illustr=\r\nate a picture of people who were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; compassionate and always will=\r\ning to forgive and forget. But still, they were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hugely success=\r\nful in their sadhana in\n their own way. And that is what we are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; talking about here....the pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody her=\r\ne I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few round=\r\ns of rosary for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is r=\r\nequired such that our sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; produces results that are easily=\r\n noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;though&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; pre-requisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continue&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;gradually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhupendr=\r\na.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ____________________=\r\n____________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;th=\r\nose&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; channels are not clean then that energy flow can create un=\r\npleasant experiences&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; like increased anger, lust etc. and oppos=\r\nite if channels are\n clean enough.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rishis have cl=\r\nean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nblessings they give are just part of divine will. like curse given to lord&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses g=\r\niven to yadav&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; vansh and king prikshit played an important role=\r\n. vimlananda was a cool guy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; except few times when he was marke=\r\ndly irritated.Like in an incidence where one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of his female dis=\r\nciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in front of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; h=\r\nim to learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; student did not learnt well what he taught t=\r\no her.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On other side people with som=\r\ne impurities like i-ness and pride may not be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; able&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to=\r\n handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning.
