I also learnt advance course as well as Padmasadhan=\r\na (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also regularly kept doing PS ALMOST everyday. Fo=\r\nr about 3 years, I used to do SK and PS regularly. \n\n\n\nNow I got started wi=\r\nth Homa on daily basis since 2008 Sept and keep doing it till date (with fe=\r\nw breaks/irregularities at times) and since then I have stopped SK, however=\r\n sometime do PS as i enjoy that systematic Yogaasanas.\n\n\n\nJust gave above b=\r\nackground which may help to assess.\n\n***\n\nSK and PS helped me cure some phy=\r\nsical chronic issues which troubled me since childhood and were helpful to =\r\nstrengthen my will power. It generated an inner attitude to sustain any pro=\r\nblems or calamities life may throw by making my mind generally calmer then =\r\nit used to be. I am able to say that because I actually faced deep crises i=\r\nn 2006 July to sept and I was still more or less unperturbed and could hand=\r\nle the situation. i increasingly become philosophical in my attitude.\n\n\n\nNo=\r\nw I started Chandi paath and Havan combination in 2008. if i now sit back a=\r\nnd look at things then i can see some striking differences. Havan and CP co=\r\nmbination striked at my emotional aspect. In the past, i was hardly tested =\r\non Emotional/Relational issues in general with society. i hardly faced any =\r\ntrouble in that area. However, when I started Havan and CP, it looks that i=\r\nt badly attacked this aspect of my being and I was severely tested. in Shor=\r\nt, My public relations which used to be always excellent (naturally) starte=\r\nd falling apart. It shook me up very badly as it never happened in the past=\r\n and I did not have enough experience, knowledge to handle such things. sev=\r\nere EQ testing then surfaced other weaknesses which i felt that i never had=\r\n :-). it amazed me at one side while at the same time It threw a formidable=\r\n challenge to my so called **ballooned spiritual ego**. All these happening=\r\n were more inside and much less tangible outside. There are crises\n i went =\r\nthrough in my job which also tested me a lot. I lost a good some of money i=\r\nn a cheating case within 6 months of starting Havan. however, fortunately I=\r\n intuitionally realised that Mother is removing bad karmas using Pavaka and=\r\n I steadfastly kept doing Havan in the midst of all these emotional, financ=\r\nial, career, family troubles and now it seems as if the dust have been sett=\r\nled more or less. quite peaceful with myself after seeing Stars in the brig=\r\nht Sunny day ;-)\n\n\n\n***\n\nSo if now i compare it, the peace of mind and will=\r\n power given by SK and PS was a surface one. They never created a situation=\r\n where in i was ruthlessly tested on my weaknesses. So i would say that the=\r\ny are spiritual practices which worked quite slowly and quite easily withou=\r\nt disturbing me. While CP and Homam actually turned me on my head. It start=\r\ned giving me a real kind of Detachment, wisdom. Few vital things have becom=\r\ne much clearer now.\n\n***\n\nPlease note that these are my personal experience=\r\ns and others can have entirely different experiences. there are many variab=\r\nles in this. i just tried to state my own experiences for whatever worth th=\r\ney may be. Please also note that Havan Sadhana does not necessarily throw t=\r\nhroubles in life of people. It all depends upon Past Samskaars of individua=\r\nls. we&#39;ll not know such things.\n\n***\n\nPlease forgive me to almost always wr=\r\nite personal things because I like to write the things which i have gone th=\r\nrough myself.\n\n\n\nJay Bhavaani!\n\n\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Namaste Guruji,\n\n&gt; I =\r\nconsider you as my Guru as you are the one of the 4\n\n&gt; prominent people who=\r\n have influenced & inspired me on spiritual path(whatever\n\n&gt; little I do) &=\r\n I find your explanations\n\n&gt; very very convincing.

I also learnt advance course as well a=\r\ns Padmasadhana (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also regularly kept doing PS ALMOST=\r\n everyday. For about 3 years, I used to do SK and PS regularly. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nN=\r\now I got started with Homa on daily basis since 2008 Sept and keep doing it=\r\n till date (with few breaks/irregularities at times) and since then I have =\r\nstopped SK, however sometime do PS as i enjoy that systematic Yogaasanas.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nJust gave above background which may help to assess.&lt;br&gt;\n***&lt;br&gt;\nSK=\r\n and PS helped me cure some physical chronic issues which troubled me since=\r\n childhood and were helpful to strengthen my will power. It generated an in=\r\nner attitude to sustain any problems or calamities life may throw by making=\r\n my mind generally calmer then it used to be. I am able to say that because=\r\n I actually faced deep crises in 2006 July to sept and I was still more or =\r\nless unperturbed and could handle the situation. i increasingly become phil=\r\nosophical in my attitude.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow I started Chandi paath and Havan com=\r\nbination in 2008. if i now sit back and look at things then i can see some =\r\nstriking differences. Havan and CP combination striked at my emotional aspe=\r\nct. In the past, i was hardly tested on Emotional/Relational issues in gene=\r\nral with society. i hardly faced any trouble in that area. However, when I =\r\nstarted Havan and CP, it looks that it badly attacked this aspect of my bei=\r\nng and I was severely tested. in Short, My public relations which used to b=\r\ne always excellent (naturally) started falling apart. It shook me up very b=\r\nadly as it never happened in the past and I did not have enough experience,=\r\n knowledge to handle such things. severe EQ testing then surfaced other wea=\r\nknesses which i felt that i never had :-). it amazed me at one side while a=\r\nt the same time It threw a formidable challenge to my so called **ballooned=\r\n spiritual ego**. All these happening were more inside and much less tangib=\r\nle outside. There are crises\n i went through in my job which also tested me=\r\n a lot. I lost a good some of money in a cheating case within 6 months of s=\r\ntarting Havan. however, fortunately I intuitionally realised that Mother is=\r\n removing bad karmas using Pavaka and I steadfastly kept doing Havan in the=\r\n midst of all these emotional, financial, career, family troubles and now i=\r\nt seems as if the dust have been settled more or less. quite peaceful with =\r\nmyself after seeing Stars in the bright Sunny day ;-)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n***&lt;br&gt;\nSo i=\r\nf now i compare it, the peace of mind and will power given by SK and PS was=\r\n a surface one. They never created a situation where in i was ruthlessly te=\r\nsted on my weaknesses. So i would say that they are spiritual practices whi=\r\nch worked quite slowly and quite easily without disturbing me. While CP and=\r\n Homam actually turned me on my head. It started giving me a real kind of D=\r\netachment, wisdom. Few vital things have become much clearer now.&lt;br&gt;\n***&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nPlease note that these are my personal experiences and others can have e=\r\nntirely different experiences. there are many variables in this. i just tri=\r\ned to state my own experiences for whatever worth they may be. Please also =\r\nnote that Havan Sadhana does not necessarily throw throubles in life of peo=\r\nple. It all depends upon Past Samskaars of individuals. we&#39;ll not know such=\r\n things.&lt;br&gt;\n***&lt;br&gt;\nPlease forgive me to almost always write personal thin=\r\ngs because I like to write the things which i have gone through myself.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nJay Bhavaani!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; yma=\r\nilto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/m=\r\nc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nam=\r\naste Guruji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I consider you as my Guru as you are the one of the 4=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; prominent people who have influenced &amp; inspired me on spiritu=\r\nal path(whatever&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; little I do) &amp; I find your explanations&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; very very convincing.
