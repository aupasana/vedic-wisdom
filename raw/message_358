Recently, we mad=\r\ne a Chandi homam manual and Sri Krishna Homam manual available. Our goal is=\r\n to create manuals for homam of several deities so that people can pick the=\r\n deity they like and do a regular homam. What we want to create is a commun=\r\nity of sincere spiritual seekers who regularly worship *a deity* (any) in f=\r\nire.\n \nNow a manual for Sri Mahalakshmi homam is ready on this auspicious d=\r\nay of Sraavana Sukravara with Sravana nakshatra! Tithi (Chaturdasi), vaara =\r\n(Sukravara), yoga (Soubhagya) and karana (Vanija) are all owned by Venus ri=\r\nght now and Venus has risen just now. Nakshatra is Sravana belonging to Vis=\r\nhnu.\n \nThe procedure taught in the manual uses 3 mantras for the main fire =\r\nritual - Sri Suktam, Mahalakshmi&#39;s 108 names taught by Lord Shiva to Parvat=\r\ni and Mahalaskhmi&#39;s Ashtakam (8 verses) composed by Lord Indra. One can pic=\r\nk the mantra one is most attracted to and try it. If one is unable to pick,=\r\n I suggest the 108 name prayer taught by Shiva. It is very powerful and app=\r\nropriate for this age.\n \nThis homam should take about 45 minutes (less with=\r\n a smaller count and more with a higher count) and hence it is possible to =\r\nuse this procedure on a daily or weekly or monthly basis. All the mantras n=\r\needed are given with detailed explanations. The document is appropriate for=\r\n total novices also. This manual is a self-sufficient document.\n \nMahalaksh=\r\nmi is normally considered the goddess of money. People think that Her homam=\r\n only gives money and not spiritual progress. However, the truth is that Ma=\r\nhalakshmi takes different forms such as Dhana Lakshmi (wealth), Dhaanya Lak=\r\nshmi (food), Santana Lakshmi (children) etc and even Moksha Lakshmi, who gi=\r\nves spiritual progress and liberation. Mahalakshmi is the goddess of well-b=\r\neing and prosperity. Wealth is one kind of well-being and spiritual progres=\r\ns is another kind of well-being. Mahalakshmi covers all kinds of well-being=\r\n. If appropriate mantras are selected for Mahalakshmi homam, it can be grea=\r\nt for spiritual progress without sacrificing material well-being.\n \nPlease =\r\ndownload the manual from\n \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam/lakshmi.htm=\r\n\n \nPlease feel free to spread the word among interested people.\n \nBest rega=\r\nrds,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0144_01C8FEAD.BA916FF0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3354&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;As some of you know,&nbsp;a \nMahaganapathi homam=\r\n manual was made available about 2 years back and several \npeople are perfo=\r\nrming Mahaganapathi homam on a daily or weekly or monthly basis \nusing it. =\r\nRecently, we made a Chandi homam manual and Sri Krishna Homam manual \navail=\r\nable.
