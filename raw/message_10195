Name accompanies form. As Aatma\n&gt; is beyond any form, space or time, it does not have any name. Gnyaanis call\n&gt; it ParaBrahma, Yogis call it Aatma, Muslims call it Allah, Christian call\n&gt; it Father in Heaven. These names are given by us. Aatma on its own is\n&gt; nameless. Yet it is our problem that we need to call it or mention it with\n&gt; some name for our discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Aatma just exists and nothing else exists.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *Yes. Very Good. Whatever we see in this world is Aatma in\n&gt; form and name. But it is still Aatma. Like for example, we see a golden\n&gt; bangle. What exist? Gold? Or bangle? If I melt the bangle, it becomes a\n&gt; lump of gold. So technically a bangle is a gold with a format. So this\n&gt; world we see is Aatma in a format. What exists without format is Aatma,\n&gt; What exists with format is Aatma again. This is the true tatva-gnyaana that\n&gt; Gnyaanis see. Avidya causes to see bangle in gold. And cry for bangle, when\n&gt; it loses its format and becomes a lump of gold. They become happy when\n&gt; bangle is formed out of gold and sad when bangle is dismantled back to\n&gt; gold. But there never existed any bangle before. So how it can exist now?\n&gt; It is the gold which is existing throughout.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus the &quot;existence&quot; of this world is only in mind or imagination, not in\n&gt; absolute sense. In absolute sense, nothing exists other than Aatma.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Aatma has a center of desire. The ability to have the desire is a\n&gt; permanent nature of Aatma.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *Yes. Very Good. Aatma has Chitta where infinite latent\n&gt; vrittis are in a seed form. To manifest itself from one to many during\n&gt; Srushti or Creation, and to squeeze itself from many to one, during pralaya\n&gt; or dissolution, is like breathing for Aatma. It cannot avoid this. It is\n&gt; its permanent nature. It is its defining characteristics. There is no\n&gt; reason for this, As it is beyond any cause-effect rule. This feature is\n&gt; like an Axiom which cannot be proven with a precedence, because in order to\n&gt; prove, we need a statement which is already proved. And to prove that one,\n&gt; we need another precedence statement, so ultimately we need to start any\n&gt; proof with an Axiom which on its own is proofless or does not require a\n&gt; proof. This is how Maths and Science are studied. Every subject has an\n&gt; Axiom. We cannot go on endlessly proving every statement.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, in geometry, the first axiom defined by Euclid is &quot; A point\n&gt; is something which cannot be measured and has no dimension.&quot; Now, you\n&gt; cannot expect Euclid to prove this. Because these are Axioms. I hope it is\n&gt; clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) When Aatma has manifested itself in its &#39;desire&#39; form. It remains in\n&gt; the three states - Waking, Dreaming, Sleeping.\n&gt; Yes. Very Good.It witnesses all these states.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) When Aatma is not in the &#39;desire&#39; form. It is in the state of Moksha.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *Yes. Very Good. Moksha is basically realizing one&#39;s true\n&gt; nature. Once Aatma realizes its true nature, and gets freedom from Avidya\n&gt; or ignorance, it is Moksha indeed. In that case, Aatma dwells without\n&gt; forming any further vrittis out of avidya or ignorance, and burns it\n&gt; remaining vrittis either though lifetimes or through the Grace of Guru\n&gt; Agni, which burns all vrittis. Without the Grace-Agni of Guru, burning of\n&gt; vrittis is nearly impossible because there are infinite vrittis, and one\n&gt; has to take infinite lifetimes to drain or discharge them out, and in that\n&gt; process if one commits or creates another vrittis, then the process is\n&gt; endless.\n&gt;\n&gt; Shrimach-Shankara-BhagavatPaada sang &quot;Punarapi Janamam, Punarapi Maranam,\n&gt; Punarapi Jananey Jatharey Shayanam,\n&gt;                                                                 &quot;Iha\n&gt; Sansaara, Bahu-Dustaara, Krupaya Paarey, Paahi Muraarey&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Meaning, &quot;Again I take birth, Again I die, Again I sleep in womb of my\n&gt; mother. This cycle of repeated lifetime is very intriguing and complicated,\n&gt; Oh Muraari, please ferry me across this bottomless ocean of repeated\n&gt; lifetimes.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt; Indeed it is a beautifully written article. I have few questions -\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *Thanks again for your kind and well-meant appreciations. I\n&gt; will be glad to answer provided with Grace and Blessings of The\n&gt; Ever-Existing Aatma in the form Shri Gurudeva.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Why does Aatma exist ?\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *Let me do its mimaansa(analysis). Let me assume that your\n&gt; question is valid, and hence assume that there does exist a valid answer.\n&gt; Consider Event A : &quot;aatma exist&quot;\n&gt; Consider Event B : &quot;reasons or cause for event A&quot;.\n&gt; If your answer is assumed to be existing, then event B must precede event\n&gt; A. In other words, event A cannot occur, unless and until event B has\n&gt; occurred.\n&gt; Now, if your question is assumed to be a valid one, then event B must also\n&gt; cannot be stand-alone entity, but has to be supported by another preceding\n&gt; event C.\n&gt; Again, assuming your question to be valid and re-applied to event C, it\n&gt; must have another precedence event D..and so on..till infinite endless loop.\n&gt; In mathematics, whenever we encounter, infinite loops or forms, we call it\n&gt; &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;undefined&quot; like even in computer science you have this\n&gt; concept. It&#39;s a hang-up.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it is clear that answer to your question does not exist\n&gt; deterministically. In such case, the question becomes invalid.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now why this invalidity is occurring for a simple question? Because, the\n&gt; question is valid only in domain of &quot;cause-effect&quot; linearity or\n&gt; circularity. In such cases, you always have a preceding point for a given\n&gt; point. Aatma is beyond all space, time, cause, effect etc. So you cannot\n&gt; apply this principle of &quot;cause-effect&quot; to Aatma which itself is beyond this\n&gt; frame of reference.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, you cannot discuss or understand Aatma logically like what\n&gt; we do to other entities in day-to-day life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Forget about Aatma, take a very simple logical infinity loop, which fails\n&gt; miserably to attain a stable logical state. I give you that example as\n&gt; follows:\n&gt;  In logic or propositional calculus, a line is called &quot;statement&quot;, if it\n&gt; attains either a &quot;Truth value&quot;(Binary 1) or a &quot;False value&quot;(Binary 0).But\n&gt; not both simultanesouly, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you imagine a line which never attains any of the truth or false\n&gt; value, but keeps oscillating or shuttling between them? Well, let me share\n&gt; it.\n&gt; A person says :&quot; I always speak lies.&quot; Now, in logic, this is not called a\n&gt; statement because it has no stable truth value or stable false value. How?\n&gt; let me explain.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the above line is true, then whatever he says is false(as he always\n&gt; speaks lies). If whatever he says is false, then whatever he said must be\n&gt; true.(because he said that he always speak lies, and this is false, so he\n&gt; must be speaking truth.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Puzzling? Well, this is called infinite loop or oscillation. The line &quot;I\n&gt; always speak lies&quot;, hence as per rules of propositional calculus, is not a\n&gt; logical statement. So, logic fails miserably even in a mere line, then how\n&gt; it can help us in defining or understanding Aatma?\n&gt;\n&gt; So the bottomline is, Aatma is neither discussed nor explained nor\n&gt; logically verified, rather it is realized. And one more thing, you cannot\n&gt; apply the condition of &quot;cause-effect&quot; to one who is beyond all this. And\n&gt; your question, is a typical &quot;cause-effect&quot; one; which violates head-on the\n&gt; very definition of Aatma as one beyond all cause-effect, space, time etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Why does Aatma has this center of desire ? Who created it ?\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *The answer is almost similar to what I discussed in the\n&gt; preceding question. Still I summarise here, Aatma by definition has Chitta,\n&gt; and none has created it. It is its very nature. And Chitta also exist\n&gt; eternally. Anything which is created will be dismantled or destroyed. Aatma\n&gt; is beyond any creation or destruction.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Does a rock has Aatma too ? Do plants have Aatma too ?\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *Yes. They all are Aatma in various forms, with various levels\n&gt; of consciousness trapped between the lowliest level to the highest level.\n&gt; Whatever we perceive through senses, and whatever we do not perceive while\n&gt; asleep, everything is Aatma only. One who realizes this gets freed from all\n&gt; sorrows, and stays in Stitha-Pragnya Awastha as Shri Krushna mentioned in\n&gt; Shrimadh-Bhagawat-geet-opanishadam.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) Why is this information (mentioned in the five points above) not easily\n&gt; visible or experienced or felt ?\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *I am very happy to hear penetrative questions from you. Your\n&gt; eagerness to know energizes me to answer you. Let me give you few examples.\n&gt; Suppose I look down upon a still water filled with mud. Will I be able to\n&gt; see my face? No. The mud creates a block in the water to reflect image\n&gt; clearly.\n&gt; But if I look down upon a clean and still water, Will I be able to see my\n&gt; face? Yes. Because the water is in its true form to reflect.\n&gt; So, why my face is not easily visible or experienced or felt in a muddy\n&gt; water? Because of the mud polluting the water. Right? Fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, likewise, if manas(mind) is very busy or turbulent in engaging itself\n&gt; in various outward activities of the 10 indriyas(5 sense and 5 action\n&gt; organs), then such Ahankaara-chitta-buddhi-manas combo called jeevaatmaa is\n&gt; said to be having a muddy water in an unstable, excited ever-active mind.\n&gt; In other words, the outward orientation of mind is equivalent to a muddy\n&gt; water.\n&gt; Under such extrovertness or bahir-mukhi-awastha, one cannot realize Aatma\n&gt; and it remains forever invisible, un-experienced and un-felt.\n&gt;\n&gt; So here is where the secret of All Saadhana lies. Which I cannot discuss\n&gt; now as the post is getting lengthy.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) How to know that what you have written is true ?\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *J..The answer is sweet and simple. By realizing Aatma,\n&gt; through quieting one&#39;s mind. In Bible it is written &quot;Be Still, And Know\n&gt; That I Am God&quot;. This is the key. &quot;Be Still&quot;. &quot;Be Quiet&quot;. It&#39;s a mere two\n&gt; words, but it will require pages to explain it and explore it. Once\n&gt; ArunagiriNathar asked Shri Kaarthikeya to utter some knowledge of Aatma.\n&gt; Shri Shanmuga answered -\n&gt; &quot;Summaa Iru&quot;. Means &quot;Be Quiet&quot;. Shri Dakshinamurthy Shiva is a 16 year old\n&gt; Gurudeva, and who never utters anything, but all knowledge is understood\n&gt; and Aatma is realized just being with him for a while. He is truly called\n&gt; &quot;Mauna-Guru&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Phil Stinnet [philstinnet@... &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;]* *Sun\n&gt; 3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]*\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot. It will be really helpful if you can answer these. I have\n&gt; more questions. But, i will ask them later.\n&gt;\n&gt; *[Kannan:] *You are very welcome. It is my utmost pleasure to get the\n&gt; opportunity to share my experience with your noble self.

Very Good. Whatever we see in this world is =\r\nAatma in form and\nname. But it is still Aatma. Like for example, we see a g=\r\nolden bangle. What\nexist? Gold? Or bangle? If I melt the bangle, it becomes=\r\n a lump of gold. So\ntechnically a bangle is a gold with a format. So this w=\r\norld we see is Aatma in a\nformat. What exists without format is Aatma, What=\r\n exists with format is Aatma\nagain. This is the true tatva-gnyaana that Gny=\r\naanis see. Avidya causes to see\nbangle in gold. And cry for bangle, when it=\r\n loses its format and becomes a lump\nof gold. They become happy when bangle=\r\n is formed out of gold and sad when\nbangle is dismantled back to gold. But =\r\nthere never existed any bangle before.\nSo how it can exist now? It is the g=\r\nold which is existing throughout.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThus the &ldquo;existence&rdquo;=\r\n of this world is only in mind or imagination,\nnot in absolute sense.

Aatma has Chitta where i=\r\nnfinite latent vrittis are in a\nseed form. To manifest itself from one to m=\r\nany during Srushti or Creation, and\nto squeeze itself from many to one, dur=\r\ning pralaya or dissolution, is like\nbreathing for Aatma. It cannot avoid th=\r\nis. It is its permanent nature. It is\nits defining characteristics. There i=\r\ns no reason for this, As it is beyond any\ncause-effect rule. This feature i=\r\ns like an Axiom which cannot be proven with a\nprecedence, because in order =\r\nto prove, we need a statement which is already\nproved. And to prove that on=\r\ne, we need another precedence statement, so\nultimately we need to start any=\r\n proof with an Axiom which on its own is\nproofless or does not require a pr=\r\noof. This is how Maths and Science are\nstudied. Every subject has an Axiom.=\r\n We cannot go on endlessly proving every\nstatement.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor example, i=\r\nn geometry, the first axiom defined by Euclid is &ldquo; A point\nis somethi=\r\nng which cannot be measured and has no dimension.&rdquo; Now, you\ncannot ex=\r\npect Euclid to prove this.

Once\nAatma realizes its true nature, and gets freedom from Avidya or ig=\r\nnorance, it\nis Moksha indeed.

Without\nthe Grace-Agni of Guru, burning of vrittis is nearly imp=\r\nossible because there\nare infinite vrittis, and one has to take infinite li=\r\nfetimes to drain or\ndischarge them out, and in that process if one commits =\r\nor creates another\nvrittis, then the process is endless. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nShrimach=\r\n-Shankara-BhagavatPaada sang &ldquo;Punarapi Janamam, Punarapi Maranam,\nPun=\r\narapi Jananey Jatharey Shayanam,&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Iha Sansaara, Bahu-Dustaara=\r\n, Krupaya Paarey, Paahi Muraarey&rdquo;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeaning, &ldquo;Again I ta=\r\nke birth, Again I die, Again I sleep in womb of my\nmother.

Let me assume t=\r\nhat your question is\nvalid, and hence assume that there does exist a valid =\r\nanswer.&lt;br&gt;\nConsider Event A : &ldquo;aatma exist&rdquo;&lt;br&gt;\nConsider Event=\r\n B : &ldquo;reasons or cause for event A&rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;\nIf your answer is assu=\r\nmed to be existing, then event B must precede event A. In\nother words, even=\r\nt A cannot occur, unless and until event B has occurred.&lt;br&gt;\nNow, if your q=\r\nuestion is assumed to be a valid one, then event B must also\ncannot be stan=\r\nd-alone entity, but has to be supported by another preceding\nevent C.&lt;br&gt;\nA=\r\ngain, assuming your question to be valid and re-applied to event C, it must=\r\n\nhave another precedence event D..and so on..till infinite endless loop.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nIn mathematics, whenever we encounter, infinite loops or forms, we call i=\r\nt &ldquo;indeterminate&rdquo;\nor &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; like even in compu=\r\nter science you have this concept.\nIt&rsquo;s a hang-up.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo it is =\r\nclear that answer to your question does not exist deterministically. In\nsuc=\r\nh case, the question becomes invalid.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow why this invalidity is o=\r\nccurring for a simple question? Because, the\nquestion is valid only in doma=\r\nin of &ldquo;cause-effect&rdquo; linearity or\ncircularity. In such cases, y=\r\nou always have a preceding point for a given\npoint. Aatma is beyond all spa=\r\nce, time, cause, effect etc. So you cannot apply\nthis principle of &ldquo;c=\r\nause-effect&rdquo; to Aatma which itself is beyond\nthis frame of reference.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn other words, you cannot discuss or understand Aatma logically =\r\nlike what we\ndo to other entities in day-to-day life.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nForget about=\r\n Aatma, take a very simple logical infinity loop, which fails\nmiserably to =\r\nattain a stable logical state. I give you that example as follows:&lt;br&gt;\n&nbs=\r\np;In logic or propositional calculus, a line is called &ldquo;statement&rdq=\r\nuo;,\nif it attains either a &ldquo;Truth value&rdquo;(Binary 1) or a &ldquo=\r\n;False\nvalue&rdquo;(Binary 0).But not both simultanesouly, of course.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nCan you imagine a line which never attains any of the truth or false va=\r\nlue, but\nkeeps oscillating or shuttling between them? Well, let me share it=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\nA person says :&rdquo; I always speak lies.&rdquo; Now, in logic, thi=\r\ns is not\ncalled a statement because it has no stable truth value or stable =\r\nfalse value. How?\nlet me explain.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf the above line is true, then =\r\nwhatever he says is false(as he always speaks\nlies). If whatever he says is=\r\n false, then whatever he said must be\ntrue.(because he said that he always =\r\nspeak lies, and this is false, so he must\nbe speaking truth.)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPuzz=\r\nling? Well, this is called infinite loop or oscillation. The line &rdquo;I\n=\r\nalways speak lies&rdquo;, hence as per rules of propositional calculus, is =\r\nnot\na logical statement. So, logic fails miserably even in a mere line, the=\r\nn how it\ncan help us in defining or understanding Aatma?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo the bo=\r\nttomline is, Aatma is neither discussed nor explained nor logically\nverifie=\r\nd, rather it is realized. And one more thing, you cannot apply the\nconditio=\r\nn of &ldquo;cause-effect&rdquo; to one who is beyond all this. And your\nque=\r\nstion, is a typical &ldquo;cause-effect&rdquo; one; which violates head-on\n=\r\nthe very definition of Aatma as one beyond all cause-effect, space, time et=\r\nc.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[Phil Stinnet [&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:philstinnet@...&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;philstinnet@...&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt; &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Li=\r\nnotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;Sun\n3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n2) Why does Aatma has this center of desire ?

Aatma is beyond any creation or\ndestruction.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[Phil Stin=\r\nnet [&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:philstinnet@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;philstinnet=\r\n@...&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-fa=\r\nmily:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;Sun\n3/1=\r\n6/2014 2:23 AM:]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:=\r\n&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n3) Does a rock has =\r\nAatma too ?

They all are Aatma in various forms, with various levels of\nconsciou=\r\nsness trapped between the lowliest level to the highest level. Whatever\nwe =\r\nperceive through senses, and whatever we do not perceive while asleep, ever=\r\nything\nis Aatma only. One who realizes this gets freed from all sorrows, an=\r\nd stays in\nStitha-Pragnya Awastha as Shri Krushna mentioned in &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nS=\r\nhrimadh-Bhagawat-geet-opanishadam.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[Phil Stinnet [&lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:philstinnet@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;philstinnet@...&lt;/a&gt;]=\r\n&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palat=\r\nino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.=\r\n5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;Sun\n3/16/2014 2:23 AM:]&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Lin=\r\notype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n4) Why is this information (mentione=\r\nd in the five points above) not easily\nvisible or experienced or felt ?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[Kannan:]&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;I am very happy to hear penetrative ques=\r\ntions from you. Your eagerness\nto know energizes me to answer you. Let me g=\r\nive you few examples.&lt;br&gt;\nSuppose I look down upon a still water filled wit=\r\nh mud. Will I be able to see my\nface? No. The mud creates a block in the wa=\r\nter to reflect image clearly.&lt;br&gt;\nBut if I look down upon a clean and still=\r\n water, Will I be able to see my face?\nYes. Because the water is in its tru=\r\ne form to reflect.&lt;br&gt;\nSo, why my face is not easily visible or experienced=\r\n or felt in a muddy water? Because\nof the mud polluting the water. Right? F=\r\nine.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow, likewise, if manas(mind) is very busy or turbulent in en=\r\ngaging itself in\nvarious outward activities of the 10 indriyas(5 sense and =\r\n5 action organs),\nthen such Ahankaara-chitta-buddhi-manas combo called jeev=\r\naatmaa is said to be\nhaving a muddy water in an unstable, excited ever-acti=\r\nve mind. In other words,\nthe outward orientation of mind is equivalent to a=\r\n muddy water.&lt;br&gt;\nUnder such extrovertness or bahir-mukhi-awastha, one cann=\r\not realize Aatma and\nit remains forever invisible, un-experienced and un-fe=\r\nlt.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo here is where the secret of All Saadhana lies. Which I cann=\r\not discuss now as\nthe post is getting lengthy.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[Phil Stinnet=\r\n [&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:philstinnet@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;philstinnet@ya=\r\nhoo.com&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-famil=\r\ny:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;Sun\n3/16/201=\r\n4 2:23 AM:]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;=\r\nPalatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n5) How to know that what=\r\n you have written is true ?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[Kannan:]&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Wingdings&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;,serif&quot;&gt;..The\nansw=\r\ner is sweet and simple.
