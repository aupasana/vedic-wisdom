We tell him that he s=\r\nhould go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we =\r\nknow that going to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of edu=\r\ncation. The goal of education is to understand the subject well and have a =\r\ngood career. It is possible to get 90% score without understanding well and=\r\n it is possible to go to IIT and not understand the subject well.\n\nSimilarl=\r\ny, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get better control over mind, overco=\r\nme the internal enemies as much as possible and become liberated. But, we t=\r\nell people to do so and so rituals, follow so and so procedures/formulas , =\r\ngo to so and so temple etc.\n\nSome formulas were created so that there is so=\r\nme structure to sadhana. But there is nothing absolute about those\n formula=\r\ns.\n\nYes, if your gurus told you the formula of n times japam, n/10 times ho=\r\nmam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to follow it, please do so. No ha=\r\nrm in it. Some people believe that such a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in a man=\r\ntra.\n\nHowever, please note that there are many people who did purascharanas=\r\n using such formulas and did not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the mantra. On =\r\nthe other hand, there are people who did not stick to those formulas and ye=\r\nt found god through the mantra.\n\nIn my opinion, you can do just japam with =\r\na mantra without worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana e=\r\ntc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in homam without any japam or tarp=\r\nana. Choose one practice and do it until your mind is so absorbed in it tha=\r\nt your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is free (like s=\r\nome people hum catchy songs when they are free).\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegardin=\r\ng the astrological formulas for evaluating the impact of a mantra, I would =\r\nlike disown those concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared b=\r\ny me in my astrology classes. There are many technicalities, but many many =\r\ncorruptions in the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and technicalitie=\r\ns of mantra shashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get specific materi=\r\nal results (and naturally those rules have been intentionally corrupted by =\r\nNature in preparation of deepening Kali).\n\nBottomline is that a mantra done=\r\n for spiritual progress works based on your mental visualization of the man=\r\ntra and its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your mind. All t=\r\nhe house calculations based on the numbers of letters and number of words a=\r\nre irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by a=\r\nnyone without worrying about technicalities.\n\nRegarding adding &quot;Om&quot;\n or &quot;Om=\r\n Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there ar=\r\ne many standard approaches. I suggest using what you were taught by your gu=\r\nrus and not worrying too much about it.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nUtpal asked about =\r\ncount vs time.

Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant prog=\r\nress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in the =\r\npast. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will =\r\npractise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh puras=\r\ncharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then I did a=\r\n homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have cal=\r\nled about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did ch=\r\nant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instru=\r\ncted us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for=\r\n marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmi=\r\nns (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish =\r\nthe ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams must be =\r\ndone. Can you shed more light on\n this? \n=C2=A0\nAlso, Gayatri mantra is a 2=\r\n4 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are a=\r\ndded it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). How shou=\r\nld this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the =\r\n24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanation? Sorry for dig=\r\nressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated here and could no=\r\nt avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretation is right and al=\r\nso please tell me which approach is better. \n=C2=A0\nNagraj\n\n--- On Wed, 1/2=\r\n0/10, Narasimha P.V.R.

Then possibly give a b=\r\nreak for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretc=\r\nhes of 100 days each.\n\nOf course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in=\r\n a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for som=\r\ne people and hence the suggestion of the break.\n\nFor success in any sadhana=\r\n, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and control of anger a=\r\nnd short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying energy). E=\r\nverytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.\n\nEvery fac=\r\ntor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition of grow=\r\ning beard exists in many religions and it is not without a reason. We discu=\r\nssed this sometime back.\n\nIf one is living a lifestyle where one avoids\n co=\r\nntact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a remote mona=\r\nstery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living a lifest=\r\nyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. liv=\r\ning in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be very =\r\nuseful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the complete=\r\n solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the side o=\r\nf a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill at nig=\r\nht but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly a bear=\r\nd can help a person with decent control over the mind to retain control in =\r\nsome tricky situations.\n\nTrimming beard is ok.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIf one in=\r\ndeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday=\r\n for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n \nwhile following the simple =\r\nrules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one =\r\nwill certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sittin=\r\ng still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other=\r\n thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body i=\r\ns not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chance that min=\r\nd will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a mome=\r\nnt, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it wi=\r\nll become still more often and for longer times. Then various kinds of sama=\r\ndhis become possible.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;na=\r\ngraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubjec=\r\nt: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure\n=\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 =\r\nPM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great mail and very inspiring.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThat then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; When t=\r\nhe sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personality si=\r\nts there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt;\n &gt; d=\r\nevatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; identif=\r\nication is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to me which is black=\r\n magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher=\r\n shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then yo=\r\nur power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After=\r\n the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or =\r\nif he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved=\r\n for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing =\r\nof karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise th=\r\nis to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city=\r\n of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even=\r\n equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic.

But =\r\nif you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has ver=\r\ny few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your a=\r\nttack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the u=\r\nniverse).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pis=\r\nacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, more=\r\nover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identifi=\r\ncation with\n&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally=\r\n termed as\n&gt; &gt; black magic.

We tell him that he should go to so=\r\n and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that goin=\r\ng to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of education. The go=\r\nal of education is to understand the subject well and have a good career. I=\r\nt is possible to get 90% score without understanding well and it is possibl=\r\ne to go to IIT and not understand the subject well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, the g=\r\noal of spiritual sadhana is to get better control over mind, overcome the i=\r\nnternal enemies as much as possible and become liberated. But, we tell peop=\r\nle to do so and so\n rituals, follow so and so procedures/formulas , go to s=\r\no and so temple etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some formulas were created so that there is som=\r\ne structure to sadhana. But there is nothing absolute about those\n formulas=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, if your gurus told you the formula of n times japam, n/10 tim=\r\nes homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to follow it, please do so. =\r\nNo harm in it. Some people believe that such a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in =\r\na mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, please note that there are many people who did pu=\r\nrascharanas using such formulas and did not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the =\r\nmantra. On the other hand, there are people who did not stick to those form=\r\nulas and yet found god through the mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, you can do=\r\n just japam with a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100t=\r\nh count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in homam without =\r\nany japam or tarpana. Choose one practice and do it until your mind is so a=\r\nbsorbed in it that your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consciously when i=\r\nt is free (like some people hum catchy songs when they are free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the astrological formulas for evaluating the=\r\n impact of a mantra, I would like disown those concepts originally taught b=\r\ny Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my astrology classes. There are many t=\r\nechnicalities, but many many corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved.=\r\n Most rules and technicalities of mantra shashtra apply to people who do pr=\r\nayogas to get specific material results (and naturally those rules have bee=\r\nn intentionally corrupted by Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Bottomline is that a mantra done for spiritual progress works based on y=\r\nour mental visualization of the mantra and its deity and the latent forces =\r\nof conditioning in your mind. All the house calculations based on the numbe=\r\nrs of letters and number of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra l=\r\nike Gayatri mantra can be done by anyone without worrying about technicalit=\r\nies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding adding &quot;Om&quot;\n or &quot;Om Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om =\r\nbhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there are many standard approaches. I sugg=\r\nest using what you were taught by your gurus and not worrying too much abou=\r\nt it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal asked about count vs time. Counts =\r\nsometimes force people to speed things up. In my humble opinion, it is fine=\r\n or even better to set a time limit (e.g. one hour, two hours etc) and do j=\r\napam for that time irrespective of the count.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Naras=\r\nimha&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writ=\r\nings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that\n make a\n difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/=\r\nJyotishWri tings&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;i&gt;&lt;nagra=\r\nj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px=\r\n solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana=\r\n procedure&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, Januar=\r\ny 20, 2010, 11:47 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1620719101&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;=\r\n0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family:=\r\n inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit;=\r\n font-size: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;&quot; val=\r\nign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Narasimhagaru, &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thank you for=\r\n such a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could s=\r\nee significant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Ga=\r\nyatri Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then=\r\n (in future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it w=\r\nas one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two mont=\r\nhs and then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, =\r\nhowever, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether=\r\n) and we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how =\r\nour Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpa=\r\nnam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding t=\r\nhe number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must=\r\n be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the =\r\nbig japams must be done. Can you shed more light on\n this? &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Also, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with ta=\r\ntsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra=\r\n (om bhur bhu va ssu vah&nbsp;). How should this be practised? 30, I suppos=\r\ne strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, acc=\r\nording to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology !

Then possibly give a break for a few days and do for a=\r\nnother 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of =\r\ncourse, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping b=\r\nrahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and hence the sug=\r\ngestion of the break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is ve=\r\nry important.

Everytime one experie=\r\nnces lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every factor contribute=\r\ns a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition of growing beard exis=\r\nts in many religions and it is not without a reason. We discussed this some=\r\ntime back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one is living a lifestyle where one avoids\n contact wi=\r\nth any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), =\r\nbeard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living a lifestyle wher=\r\ne one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. living in t=\r\nhe modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be very useful. =\r\nAs I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the complete solutio=\r\nn but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill=\r\n road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill at night but b=\r\ne unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly a beard can he=\r\nlp a person with decent control over the mind to retain control in some tri=\r\ncky situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trimming beard is ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I=\r\nf one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) =\r\neveryday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n &lt;br&gt;while following =\r\nthe simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same dire=\r\nction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing=\r\n and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed i=\r\ns the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if=\r\n the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chan=\r\nce that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still for =\r\neven a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being s=\r\ntill, it will become still more often and for longer times.

How can i&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; again experience the=\r\n Beloved.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is don=\r\ne correctly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such tha=\r\nt the deity&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experienc=\r\nes himself as that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There then ari=\r\nses no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; cert=\r\nain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;\n &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evoluti=\r\non&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; continues.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very littl=\r\ne=C3=82 according to me which is black magic.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is all a use =\r\nof Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; such as=\r\n Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or i=\r\nf he was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm =\r\nreserved for these&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; beings.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadha=\r\nk brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the attac=\r\nkers and some people may realise this to their detriment(&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Pata=\r\nn comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you =\r\nattack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from=\r\n that same Atma&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later.=\r\n But if you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the univer=\r\nse and has very few karmas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself atta=\r\ncks you, because your attack is not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his=\r\n identification, ie God or the universe).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If people persist in=\r\n using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then the=\r\nre is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhen their minds and intellects will not be free of identification with&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed=\r\n as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits\n w=\r\nhich they have&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyabl=\r\ne experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for =\r\na few lifetimes, then&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to=\r\n that deity and such a sadhak&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repition=\r\ns of a mantra(because of his previous&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; On=\r\n the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may =\r\nnot&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; According to me the=\r\n proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest an e=\r\nasy sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good=\r\n day, do 1000&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this t=\r\nhe=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, m=\r\nain constraints&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same\n place.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same materials.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direction.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As =\r\nlittle movement as one can.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is =\r\nyour inclination.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and =\r\nthe body, not just the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are=\r\n empty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; before you start.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 da=\r\nys and do this whole procedure 3 times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; See the difference in =\r\nyour personality before and after.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is im=\r\nportant is that life may be short, so do some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, and per=\r\nsist with that sadhana for as long as is physically&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; possible.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being di=\r\nscussed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; manish&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n clarification fro=\r\nm me if you feel&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET=\r\n now has a personality.
