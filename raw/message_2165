The verses after it are \nresults (phalasruti etc). The exact kavacha is the verses above.\n\nWhat Robert Koch mentioned are three very good mantras for Narayana, but \nthey are NOT Narayana kavacha. They are used in the nyasa (placement) before \nreciting Narayana kavacha. With each of the three mantras, there is a way to \nplace each letter of the mantra in a body part and create the environment \nfor the kavacha to work optimally. You say the three mantras while focusing \nmind fully on different body parts while saying different letters of the \nmantras.\n\nHowever, like I said before, the nyasa done by people before mantras is just \na formality and people do not know how to place a letter in a body part. I \nam not saying it is a secret that needs to be learnt. It is not a matter of \n&quot;technique&quot;. It is a matter of mental focus. Placement of letters in several \nbody parts is an act of mental focus. These days, people cannot focus their \nmind on anything. Thus, nyasa is just a formality with no real meaning.\n\nThus, my advice is: Do what you feel like or are taught, before and after \nthe above verses, but make sure you read the verses I identified above. That \nis the real kavacha.\n\nAny kavacha works over long time. If you chant it regularly with good mental \nfocus, it forms an invisible protective shield around your subtle body. \nNarayana kavacha is a very powerful mantra.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Ashutosh&quot; &lt;asro_1@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, July 17, 2009 7:51 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Guidance abtout Narayan Kavach recita\n\n\n&gt; Resp Guru Narsimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sire, for long  have been following your lectures provided online. So for \n&gt; me your are my Guru (least adrishya guru) from whom I receive (derive) \n&gt; guidance\n&gt;\n&gt; Lately i have decided to start reciting Narayan Kavach. As usual i am in \n&gt; doubt as can i start such a practice with an initiation from a Guru.?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also my search through the webpages to get a copy of Naryan Kavach lead me \n&gt; to confusion.\n&gt; On one site I got a version which is completely different from an sanskrit \n&gt; version available on site : http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_1_index.html.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also this Sanskrit version mentions the whole dialogue between the Rishi \n&gt; and the King. My confusion is for a sadhana shall i recite the Narayan \n&gt; Kavach as some dialogue between Rishi and King or is there a complete \n&gt; separate prayer as Kavach?\n&gt;\n&gt; To add to my confusion i found a paper by Robert Koch from a SJC conferece \n&gt; on Narayan dasa. In this he mentions about this kavach and  quotes three \n&gt; mantras viz 1. om vi&#7779;&#7751;ave nama&#7717;\n&gt;                          2. om namo n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;ya\n&gt;                          3. om namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya\n&gt;\n&gt; and says that reciting them as daily sadhana will help.\n&gt;\n&gt; So i request you to please guide me as what is Narayan Kavach, how shall \n&gt; one put it into sadhana and if possible could share a copy of this Kavach \n&gt; in the form it is to be recited.\n&gt;\n&gt; sincerely\n&gt; Ashutosh\n\n\n"}}
