They are all different, but all are valid paths. But \neach comes with different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nHomam requires external substances that need to be acquired and used. By \ngod&#39;s grace, many of us can afford to do it and we do it. But it is not \naffordable to all. Can a poor person with not much to eat do a homam \neveryday? Even if homam is done on a very small scale, it still requires \natleast half a coconut and some ghee. That costs money. One can buy some \nfood with that money!\n\nBut the strength of homam is that nobody is at risk with it. Even one with \nvery bad vaasanas and not supervised by a capable guru will only benefit \nfrom homam. As one performs it everyday, one&#39;s vasanas will be purified one \nby one. There is no risk of fall.\n\nRaja yoga practices need your body and air that is available everywhere \nfreely. It is far simpler and easier and everyone can afford it.\n\nHowever, it is not risk free. If one is eating saattwik food in limited \namounts, leading a saattwik lifestyle, has good control over mind and the \nair being breathed is pure and a guru is available to save if energy rises \nand becomes uncontrollable, then raja yoga and hatha yoga practices will \nwork. If one of these is lacking, one can run into problems.\n\nThese are not just my words. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who mastered various \nspiritual paths (including various sects of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, \njnaana yoga, bhakti yoga, karma yoga and raja yoga), told his sishyas that \nraja yoga and hatha yoga are risky in this age.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, March 06, 2009 1:05 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Element of Vayu and Pavak - Kriya Yoga and Homa !!!\n\n&gt; Namaste Garu!\n&gt;\n&gt; One questioning thought which is stuck in my mind which i wish to put it\n&gt; in front of you & list.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agni is purer then Vayu - this comparision statement is not very difficult\n&gt; to accept.\n&gt;\n&gt; BUT i am thinking about Yogis, who reached the truth by first holding on\n&gt; to the silk thread (breath) which is the only available external link\n&gt; which connects external and internal world contineously.\n&gt;\n&gt; for example take a couple of cases such as Babaji and his leanage. Sri Sri\n&gt; Ravishankar, Rishi Prabhakar and many such known and unknown.\n&gt; these people (especially the first to names) advocated &#39;Kriya Yoga&#39; in a\n&gt; very big way. Paramhamsa Yogananada in his celebrated work &#39;The\n&gt; autobiography of a yogi&#39; categorically mention that Kriya Yoga is like a\n&gt; Jet Flight to reach the truth in comparision to the other methods which\n&gt; are like bullock cart. he also mentions that Kriya yoga was first taught\n&gt; by Krishna to Arjuna and then it was lost in time and was again revived by\n&gt; Mahaavatar Bababji and passed on to Lahir Mahashaya and the others.\n&gt; It is claimed that Sri sri Ravishankar went in to deep silence for some 8\n&gt; days in the year 1980 and he came out with &#39;Sudarshan Kriya Yoga&#39; for the\n&gt; world. he started teaching that and now it is practised regularly by\n&gt; millions of people.\n&gt; I know from my abstract experiences that Kriya yoga of Babaji and\n&gt; Sudarshan kriya yoga by Sri Sri are essentially same. why i say that\n&gt; because one day i yearningly prayed babaji for helping me to learn Kriya\n&gt; yoga and within a month i learnt Sudarshan kriya by AOL accidently.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; The point is that these people are advocating some or the other form of\n&gt; Kriya yoga, Raja Yoga, Hathyoga etc.. for all of these initial base is\n&gt; external medium which is Air (Vayu). I myself have done Sudarshan Kriya\n&gt; for some 2 years.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Babaji or Sri Sri or any other master (present day or ancient) have\n&gt; stressed on this medium. they actually didn&#39;t advocate Agni for the masses\n&gt; (Though as i said in prevous message that some have started advocating\n&gt; Homa of late). it is obvious that they may not be oblivious of the fact\n&gt; that Agni is more purer medium then air.\n&gt;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; I Wish to have your views on this whole subject.\n&gt;\n&gt; yours spiritually,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
