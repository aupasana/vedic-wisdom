When I floated the idea, Manish discourag=\r\ned me. He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be co=\r\nnsidered later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.\n \nPlease note=\r\n that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and =\r\nprayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They =\r\nare tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses =\r\nof some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the pas=\r\nt.\n \nAn intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, righ=\r\nt frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra that was =\r\nused by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n \nIn fact, the words =\r\nof a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be more effective =\r\nfor spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person that one can inte=\r\nllectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not worrying about whet=\r\nher one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras coming from great r=\r\nishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf I were to give an analogy =\r\nin terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot of scholarly analysis=\r\n on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the hand of the bowler, how=\r\n to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how to play it with a str=\r\naight bat, when to play front foot and when to play back foot etc. But that=\r\n does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one practices, THAT can m=\r\nake one a good player. Of course, some basic understanding of principles is=\r\n needed. But, above that, practice is more important than bookish knowledge=\r\n.\n \nSimilarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spirituality a=\r\nlso, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n \nThe essence of all script=\r\nures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. It is that we sh=\r\nould overcome the notions that we are doing things and realize that the div=\r\nine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each being based on one=\r\n&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goes through the cyc=\r\nle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like=\r\n this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures=\r\n and one knows it, one may be deluded again and again. There is no magic fo=\r\nrmula to internalize this understanding fully and overcome the instincts of=\r\n &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n \nSo, even if one practices a mantra tha=\r\nt one does not intellectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic =\r\nessence of scriptures is at the back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly conte=\r\nmplating and watching over one&#39;s own thoughts and instincts, to root out un=\r\ndesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana will yield results.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nThis is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scr=\r\niptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or=\r\n virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a=\r\n theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of =\r\none&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n \nOne doing=\r\n sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what and what=\r\n we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead of clim=\r\nbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical underst=\r\nanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but=\r\n keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n \n*        *        =\r\n*\n \nRegarding the statement that initiation is important in tantric path bu=\r\nt not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n \nWhether Vedic and tantrik =\r\npaths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There =\r\nare a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n \nThe issue is not really Tantrik vs=\r\n Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants s=\r\npecific material results needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. =\r\nRe-arrangement of karmas to affect a particular result is not easy. It requ=\r\nires supervision of a good guru and not many are left anyway. On the other =\r\nhand, if one is NOT looking for specific material results and is looking fo=\r\nr spiritual progress, the constraints are fewer and options more.\n \nSome ma=\r\ny sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific=\r\n material results and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect=\r\n. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in l=\r\nitigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in th=\r\ne Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforc=\r\ne the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towar=\r\nds some objects.\n \n*        *        *\n \nMy thumbrule is this. If you are l=\r\nooking for a specific material result, you need clear guidance and supervis=\r\nion, which not many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiri=\r\ntual progress and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sa=\r\ndhana without initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and o=\r\nther like-minded people.\n \nAfter all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you ne=\r\ned clear and precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to g=\r\no to north pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supe=\r\nrvision helps there too, but you can do without it!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasim=\r\nha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://Sarasw=\r\natiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- =\r\nvedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any &gt;othe=\r\nr regional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;constant refl=\r\nection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a language =\r\nthat they can fully follow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its un=\r\nderstandable.

Since the last 4-5 ye=\r\nars I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reaso=\r\nns. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. Howe=\r\nver after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my writ=\r\ne up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some pos=\r\nts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and m=\r\nore sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this=\r\n particular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessit=\r\ny of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture that n=\r\needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY ans=\r\nwers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? Generally=\r\n speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement =\r\nfor spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question =\r\nis about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by=\r\n *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir =\r\nbhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple appro=\r\naches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspec=\r\ntives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in t=\r\nhe current context of this question I will restrict myself to only the five=\r\n that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic=\r\n/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Ta=\r\nntric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- =\r\nRitual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing=\r\n but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each =\r\nof the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its atte=\r\nmpt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us br=\r\niefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of these=\r\n paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, st=\r\nrictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can gre=\r\natly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direc=\r\nt path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichar=\r\na (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik =\r\nsystem it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-stu=\r\ndy of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices involve t=\r\nhe &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) =\r\nand Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga addi=\r\ntionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Suprem=\r\ne Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only th=\r\ne first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga =\r\n(Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will throug=\r\nh total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma mar=\r\nga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions with=\r\nout attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where=\r\n alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of =\r\na Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occu=\r\nlt truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It pre=\r\nsupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain=\r\n regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti=\r\n marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predo=\r\nminantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;=\r\n). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of t=\r\nhe intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, an=\r\nd yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantr=\r\na&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like=\r\n practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques th=\r\nat bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara =\r\nis not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a chil=\r\nd to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need=\r\n experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper train=\r\ning and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety meas=\r\nures, in the Tantric lab experiment too.  However the lab is one&#39;s own cons=\r\nciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individua=\r\nl consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a top=\r\nic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on =\r\nthe Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just =\r\nelaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talki=\r\nng about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tant=\r\nric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric contex=\r\nt. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. H=\r\nowever there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living =\r\ntraditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri S=\r\nri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to =\r\nSrikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Bu=\r\nddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan =\r\nBuddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajray=\r\nana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its a=\r\npproach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (no=\r\nt that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Som=\r\na, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The =\r\nyantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set =\r\nof synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation i=\r\ns the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual li=\r\nneage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTE=\r\nD TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each bran=\r\nch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the in=\r\ndividual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Anot=\r\nher modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by =\r\nthe Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessa=\r\nry for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine =\r\nmany beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wir=\r\nes, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all=\r\n the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) an=\r\nd Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated=\r\n Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness th=\r\nrough an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, =\r\nBhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly =\r\ncomprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the ma=\r\nny in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. =\r\nHowever it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishad=\r\ns. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. =\r\nThe question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantrama=\r\nrga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explor=\r\ne the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I h=\r\nave covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined =\r\nto the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely pow=\r\nerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, =\r\nthe crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself pr=\r\noclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a secon=\r\nd, saying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (=\r\n10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect o=\r\nn the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-i=\r\nnitiate to read in English or any other regional language is because unders=\r\ntanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repe=\r\natedly reads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main i=\r\ndea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too=\r\n apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is al=\r\nso equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four =\r\nhymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samh=\r\nita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chan=\r\ndi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will st=\r\nraightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even=\r\n the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIV=\r\nED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of =\r\nSri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are tho=\r\nse who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra =\r\nmarga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per its own =\r\nprinciples. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of =\r\nViveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the =\r\nPauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Hom=\r\nam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik p=\r\nractice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approach=\r\nes to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and b=\r\nreathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced origin=\r\nally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Ta=\r\nntra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual =\r\nprogress through any of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhy=\r\naya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, S=\r\nakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However depending on the individua=\r\nl temperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods are more suited relativ=\r\nely to different practitioners. One may progress through a combination of a=\r\nny of these methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrate=\r\nd approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture a=\r\ngainst which the answer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA a=\r\nnd SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is reg=\r\nular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in =\r\nthe texts. This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant wit=\r\nh. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swad=\r\nhyaya is the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is n=\r\not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make r=\r\napid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted =\r\nstate by virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the company o=\r\nf sadhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorak=\r\nhnath  made a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the=\r\n Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays,=\r\n I will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE  // &quot;There is a complaint b=\r\ny householders nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame exc=\r\nuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is =\r\na sincere demand, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable law =\r\nof nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your thr=\r\neshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and un=\r\nholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your =\r\ntime in idle gossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless =\r\nslave of passion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot=\r\n get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come=\r\n to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put yo=\r\nu in the right path, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;o=\r\nversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspira=\r\nnts. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;=\r\nThere are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There a=\r\nre no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot;  //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain ext=\r\nent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the app=\r\nropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not compar=\r\nable to the actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas=\r\n such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplif=\r\nting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflect=\r\nion, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on =\r\na group such as this, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may not inte=\r\nract regularly or reply at least for a while. However I might participate i=\r\nn some discussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_patha=\r\nk@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read this m=\r\nessage of respected Narasimha Garu few times. Frankly, i found it routine b=\r\necause i found that i know all these already as he has so many times mentio=\r\nned these things  and then it suddenly occoured to me that he has given ans=\r\nwer to a very very crucial query which keep on haunting many people and con=\r\nfuse people a lot. I am obviously talking about &quot;Initiation&quot; and he has rea=\r\nlly given an answer to this greatly confusing phenomina. I am reproducing t=\r\nhis again below. for me i am completely satisfied with simple but very effe=\r\nctive defination. i would draw attention of members to following paragraph =\r\nagain:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any ma=\r\nntra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several=\r\n material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ri=\r\ntual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not necess=\r\narily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increa=\r\nse my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAF=\r\nE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Its a time to say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true sens=\r\ne! I know he&#39;ll not like my post but what can I do? I like him as i like Th=\r\nakur and Sachin Tendulkar :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nUtpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ha=\r\nppy Vijaya Dasami!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) I do not share Dr Choudhary&#39;s op=\r\ninion about reading English translation instead of Sanskrit verses if one i=\r\ns not initiated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Initiation serves two purposes:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2a) As in the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may =\r\nopen a bank account in a son&#39;s name with a starting balance of one million =\r\ndollars. Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer s=\r\nome of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich father is still better=\r\n off opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slowly w=\r\nith one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sad=\r\nhana with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find=\r\n a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get i=\r\nnitiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mant=\r\nras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific materi=\r\nal results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual p=\r\nrogress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the=\r\n case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. O=\r\nne can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said sev=\r\neral times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has=\r\n destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest=\r\n doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever =\r\nmaterial results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is=\r\n meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for oneself=\r\n or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make arrangements f=\r\nor one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one sh=\r\nould start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want t=\r\no do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it  with the a=\r\nttitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfi=\r\nl them. Because of this ritual, god may give any material results or spirit=\r\nual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever g=\r\nod gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual p=\r\nrogress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itse=\r\nlf is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good resul=\r\nts slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, b=\r\nut there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine tha=\r\nt a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in=\r\n garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the pers=\r\non is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the=\r\n floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and=\r\n there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fru=\r\nit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala=\r\n of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and =\r\nthrow them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some s=\r\npillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more tim=\r\ne to get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce dei=\r\nty like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but=\r\n the good fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember =\r\nthat these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions=\r\n. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten fruits befo=\r\nre eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to =\r\ntake some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce de=\r\nities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if mad=\r\ne mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If y=\r\nou realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad=\r\n results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions =\r\nand the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted=\r\n, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never l=\r\nit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam=\r\n now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first t=\r\nime just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati e=\r\nveryday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienc=\r\ned some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana=\r\n of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has even=\r\n a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for god and =\r\nis attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person =\r\nobviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that =\r\nsadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what is what, how t=\r\nhings work, why one should do something, how to do it, what is more importa=\r\nnt and what is less important, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
