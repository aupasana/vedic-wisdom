I have a doubt on the sapta rishis. Hope you answer this question. I tho=\r\nught that the sapta rishis too were &#39;temporary&#39; i.e they too changed in eac=\r\nh Manvantara [or age of Manu]...Wikipedia says that it takes 14 Manus and t=\r\nheir respective Manvantaras to create a Kalpa, Aeon, or a `Day of Brahma&#39;[S=\r\norry, I dont know Sanskrit, so I have to use Google & Wikipedia to lookup i=\r\nnfo]....So, does it not mean that in each Manvantara, there are &quot;a differen=\r\nt sets of Sapta Rishis&quot;, which means that &#39;Sapta Rishis&#39; too are temporary,=\r\n something like the analogy of the&#39;fruits on the tree at the side of the ro=\r\nad&#39; of one&#39;s journey to the top of the mountain, the mountain here meaning =\r\none&#39;s own Self or the eternal BRAHMAN? \n\nPlease forgive my ignorance, I&#39;m t=\r\nrying to understand better....\n\n\n\n\n"}}
