I was close to Grafton, in Milford.\n&gt; I have learned a lot from your website and homam guides but was reluctant to use them for some time until I did on Janamashtmi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some sources say Yama Deep should be on Dhanteras, 2 days before Diwali and some say tomorrow Oct. 16th?\n&gt; Also in superstition, if someone loses gold on dhanteras, is it bad luck?... should laxmi prarthana be done to rectify this?\n&gt; Please shed some light...\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you, I look forward to your answer and taking part in many more discussions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vedic Sanatan Dharma Kee Jai!\n&gt; Chetan\n\n\n"}}
