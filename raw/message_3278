You can also check with=\r\n them if CP is available in your &#39;mother Tongue&#39; (Not only translation but =\r\nalso the verses)\n\nIf that&#39;s not possible, then you can think of ordering CP=\r\n in English by Deva datta Kali. Name of the book is &#39;In Praise of The Mothe=\r\nr&#39;. The link to order is given below:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Praise-Goddess-=\r\nDevimahatmya-Its-Meaning/dp/089254080X.\n\nThis book has all the verses of Du=\r\nrga Saptashati given in English so that you can read. i also suggest to dow=\r\nnload MP3 from Narasimha&#39;s site where he has himself recorded the Durga Sap=\r\ntashati in his own voice. That will be very useful to get familiarize with =\r\nOriginal Sanskrit pronunciation of all the verses.\nhttp://www.vedicastrolog=\r\ner.org/\nClick on &#39;Listen to Manta&#39; and you will get to the link of MP3.\n\nPl=\r\nease listen many times to get familiarized.\n\nAs far as homam is concerned, =\r\nadd swaha (offering Aahuti at the same time) at the end of each verse and U=\r\nchu/Uvach. Do not forget to refer to Homam manual and follow the instructio=\r\nns specifically given for offering Aahutis.\n\nI think this should be enough =\r\nto get started.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nRegards,\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metllapalli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a Durga Saptas=\r\nhati book which has everything in story format.Can it be used for doing the=\r\n chandi homam? Where to put swaha ? I am confused. Moreover it doesn&#39;t have=\r\n the saptashati nyaasa. Does anyone know of any specific book which has all=\r\n the shlokas (preferably English)and is good for homam? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sud=\r\nha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
