Here are my 2 cents.\n=A0\nKeeping an &quot;auspici=\r\nous number&quot; as the final count is not that important. The suggested targets=\r\n in shastras (4, 8, 12, 28, 108 etc) are just for guidance. You can do any =\r\nnumber of times. Instead of the count weighing on your mind and disturbing =\r\nyour focus, it is better to do as many times as you can, with better focus.=\r\n\n=A0\nI&#39;d even recommend deciding how long you can do it, keep an alarm next=\r\n to you and then keep making offerings until alarm rings. In this age, I am=\r\n in favor of measuring in terms of time rather than mantra counts. Even at =\r\ntemples, I see people hurrying things because they have count targets to me=\r\net and have time pressures (e.g. Sri Sooktam 16 times, Rudram 11 times etc)=\r\n. Instead of doing 16 times in a hurry, it is better to do 6 or 7 times slo=\r\nwly and while fully enjoying it. If you have 25 minutes, do it for 25 minut=\r\nes and as many times as possible in those 25 minutes, without hurrying thin=\r\ngs or making them artificial.\n=A0\nIn my daily homam as\n well as japam, I do=\r\n not follow any fixed counts. In homam, I do my mantra as many times as I f=\r\neel like it. For japam, I put an alarm after certain time and meditate unti=\r\nl alarm rings, without counting.\n=A0\nWhen I must count in homam, I make off=\r\nerings in fixed positions and use that for counting. For example, I start i=\r\nn east and go till northeast clockwise, covering each corner, then make an =\r\noffering in the middle and that makes it 9 offerings. I then do the same in=\r\n reverse order and that makes it 18. Three/six such cycles make 54/108. Thi=\r\ns is a simple method to keep count with very little mental overhead and, at=\r\n the same time, to keep fire going in all corners. If I need 28, it is 3x9+=\r\n1. However, it is best to not count and do as many times as you can.\n=A0\nJu=\r\nst my 2 cents and do as you feel appropriate and applicable in your case!\n\n=\r\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\r\n--1287737115-905379208-1367088410=:30936\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv7710493537&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv7710493537yui_3_7_2_31_136702521=\r\n5463_55&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv7710493537yui_3_7_2_31_1367025215463_66&quot;&gt;Namaste fr=\r\neinds,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;fon=\r\nt-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-sty=\r\nle:normal;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv7710493537yui_3_7_2_31_1367025215463_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;y=\r\niv7710493537yui_3_7_2_31_1367025215463_66&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv7710493537yui_3_7_2_31_1367025215463_82&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-=\r\nsize:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:tr=\r\nansparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv7710493537yui_3_7_2_31_1367025=\r\n215463_66&quot;&gt;A friend who does homam asked:&lt;/span&gt; &quot;&lt;span\n id=3D&quot;yiv771049353=\r\n7yui_3_7_2_32_1367025215463_145&quot;&gt;One of the things that I find tricky is co=\r\nunt of mantras, I find it difficult to keep count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;y=\r\niv7710493537yui_3_7_2_32_1367025215463_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv7710493537yui_3_=\r\n7_2_32_1367025215463_140&quot;&gt;Any\n suggestions from your side will help.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The same question was asked by a few other people in the past.
