You can find some answers in the archives. I will briefly\nanswer again.\n\nOn your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter\nof BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/rituals,\nI am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).\n\n* * *\n\nWe can get it in right perspective by noting that the very previous line\nsays &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;.\n\nYes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe. However, is\nit possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;Om&quot; and reach god?\nProbably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as the\nmahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om&quot;, because\nKrishna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.\n\nSame thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.\n\nJust as one may need ropes and other gear to climb mount everest, one may\nneed to employ mantras other than &quot;Om&quot; and practices other than &quot;japam&quot;\nto overcome one&#39;s short-comings and reach the summit of the absolute,\nrepresented by Om (and all other things mentioned by Krishna).\n\n* * *\n\nWhen you do an external sacrifical ritual such as homam, your body is\nengaging in actions. So your mind has to be attached to the body and use\nit in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while doing homam?\nUnlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the external\nactions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absorb fully\nin the mantra at some stage then.\n\nFrom the point of view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a mantra)\nis the ultimate sadhana.\n\nHowever, not everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas\n(conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until\nthat is done, japam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the\nhelp of an external pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying\neffect on one&#39;s subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one\nfor good japam.\n\n* * *\n\nA lot of priests do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the\nhomam manuals, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam with\ntheir favorite mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with\nclosed eyes. The idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and\n*prepares* one for reaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one\nto god. After every homam, one&#39;s internal purity is at a maximum (a local\nmaximum, temporally speaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam\nwill be more fruitful than at other times.\n\n* * *\n\nNow onto other questions:\n\n(1) It is unfruitful in the sense that it does not take you closer to\ngod. It is fruitful in the sense that it stops you from going much\nfurther away from god. After all, if you weren&#39;t engaged in that japam\nand you were doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander\neven more.\n\nI suggest looking at disturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as a\nheckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguing and fighting with\nthe heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a second and move on.\nInstead of panicking or worrying, simply take note of your thoughts,\npause for a second and move on.\n\n(2) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various\nvasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in different directions to\nreact to various situations in various ways and that activity tires out\nthe mind. You protect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teaching it to\novercome the pulls of vasana.\n\nThe proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not\nis whether there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether\nyour internal reaction to various external things is changing for the\nbetter or not.\n\n(3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is helpful.\n\nActually, in this age, technical perfection is almost ruled out. I\nsuggest doing whatever one does with a sense of surrender and humility.\nIf there is something partly correct that somebody is doing, it will\nslowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfections with time.\n\n(4) I can write Obama&#39;s name and Gordon&#39;s name on sheets of paper next to\nme and pretend that they came there and sat there. Will they really do\nit? On the other hand, if I am a world leader holding a summit, probably\nI can make them actually come and sit there.\n\nNyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrations\n(sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most of\nus with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing.\nOnly a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place\nvarious vibrations and energies in various body parts.\n\nI always suggest to people to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the\nknowledge lives and is passed on), but not worry too much about it.\n\nAs I said, we are in the midst of deepening Kali and the level of\nsadhakas is not as high as in the old days. Technical perfection will\nbecome rarer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrender and humility.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Japa&quot; amongst all Yajnas.\nThis statement establishes the supremacy of Japa over all other kinds of\nrituals. I have the following queries regarding Japa.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Many a times while doing japa the mind wanders. The chanting done at\nthese instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sense of devotion in the\nmind and are merely a physical chanting. Are such japas unfruitful?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Is there some way to validate that the japa shall actually bring\ncertain merits or nullify the targeted evils? \n&gt; \n&gt; 3) How can an ordinary person determine whether the japa he is doing\n(or has done) is being done in a proper manner? For example if there was\nsome error in pronunciation or some nyasa was not performed correctly\nwhich invalidated the japa - can it be detected by the sadhaka himself by\nsome means? \n&gt; \n&gt; 4) There is a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing mantras\nwhere deities are invited on various body parts. Do those deities\nactually come and protect the entire process of Japa? Can one perceive\ntheir presence in anyway - say maybe by observing a change in the aura\naround the sadhaka?\n&gt; \n&gt; with regards\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nPenny Stock Jumping 2000%\nSign up to the #1 voted penny stock newsletter for free today!\nhttp://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL3141/4be8747dc9c3856af8m05vuc\r\n----__JNP_000_7be1.37d2.3ec7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META content=3Dtext/html;charset=3DUTF-8 http-equiv=3Dcontent-ty=\r\npe&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18904&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY=\r\n style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha Ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I rea=\r\nd oneof your email where you had written how Pandit Manish Ji has \ntalked a=\r\nbout using some mantra before Gayatri mantra to get bettr results.I \ncould =\r\nnot find that email.If you could please &nbsp;repost it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Jagmeet&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On Wed, 21 Apr 2010 17:37:5=\r\n4 -0400 Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;pvr@chart=\r\ner.net&lt;/A&gt;&gt; writes:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px=\r\n solid; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px&quot; \ndir=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;Namaste Ven=\r\neet ji,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nice questions!

T=\r\nechnical perfection will become rarer and rarer. \n  It is better to focus o=\r\nn surrender and humility.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n  regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------=\r\n---&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;Free \n  Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; \n  ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rolog=\r\ner.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films \n  that make a difference: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFil&lt;WBR&gt;ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: \n  &lt;A \n  h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;WBR&gt;yahoo=\r\n.com/&lt;WBR&gt;group/vedic-&lt;WBR&gt;wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish \n  writings: &lt;A \n  href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;WBR&gt;yahoo.co=\r\nm/&lt;WBR&gt;group/JyotishWri&lt;WBR&gt;tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---=\r\n------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- \n  Venee=\r\nt Kumar &lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:kveneet%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;kveneet@yahoo.&lt;WBR&gt;co=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;=\r\nJapa&quot; amongst all \n  Yajnas. This statement establishes the supremacy of Ja=\r\npa over all other kinds \n  of rituals. I have the following queries regardi=\r\nng Japa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) \n  Many a times while doing japa the mind wand=\r\ners. The chanting done at these \n  instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; =\r\nor sense of devotion in the mind and \n  are merely a physical chanting. Are=\r\n such japas unfruitful?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) \n  Is there some way to validat=\r\ne that the japa shall actually bring certain \n  merits or nullify the targe=\r\nted evils? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) How can an ordinary \n  person determine whe=\r\nther the japa he is doing (or has done) is being done in a \n  proper manner=\r\n? For example if there was some error in pronunciation or some \n  nyasa was=\r\n not performed correctly which invalidated the japa - can it be \n  detected=\r\n by the sadhaka himself by some means? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4) There is a \n  t=\r\nradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing mantras where deities are \n  =\r\ninvited on various body parts. Do those deities actually come and protect t=\r\nhe \n  entire process of Japa? Can one perceive their presence in anyway - s=\r\nay maybe \n  by observing a change in the aura around the sadhaka?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; with \n  regards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font SIZE=3D&quot;2&quot; color=3D&quot;#0=\r\n00000&quot;&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;a style=3D&quot;TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot; href=3D&quot;http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.=\r\ncom/TGL3142/4be8747dc9c3856af8m05vuc&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#004080&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Penny Stock Jumping 2000%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Sign up to the #1 voted penny stock n=\r\newsletter for free today!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a style=3D&quot;COLOR: #000000&quot; href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL3142/4be8747dc9c3856af8m05vuc&quot; target=3D_blan=\r\nk&gt;AwesomePennyStocks.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\r\n----__JNP_000_7be1.37d2.3ec7--\r\n\n\r\n----__JNP_000_5160.6c04.3595\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; \n\tname=&quot;b?P=283dd878-4d8e-11df-b8aa-df516d0c4d54&T=1c9dq6grr%2fX%3d1271885880%2fE%3d1705075991%2fR%3dgroups%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d3384422245%2fH%3dY29udGVudD0iRmluYW5jZTtQaG90b3M7RXZlbnRzO0dvO01haWw7QnJpZWZjYXNlO0Jvb2ttYXJrO0hvdGpvYnM7UG9kY2.13298430%2fD%3dMKP1%2fB%3d6060255%2fV%3d1&quot;\r\nContent-Location: http://us.bc.yahoo.com/b?P=283dd878-4d8e-11df-b8aa-df516d0c4d54&T=1c9dq6grr%2fX%3d1271885880%2fE%3d1705075991%2fR%3dgroups%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d3384422245%2fH%3dY29udGVudD0iRmluYW5jZTtQaG90b3M7RXZlbnRzO0dvO01haWw7QnJpZWZjYXNlO0Jvb2ttYXJrO0hvdGpvYnM7UG9kY2FzdHM7TWVzc2VuZ2VyOyIgZGlzYWJsZXNodWZmbGluZz0iMSIgc2VydmVJZD0iMjgzZGQ4NzgtNGQ4ZS0xMWRmLWI4YWEtZGY1MTZkMGM0ZDU0IiBzaXRlSWQ9IjI3OTYwNTEiIHRTdG1wPSIxMjcxODg1ODgwMDI0MjIyIiA-%2fQ%3d-1%2fS%3d1%2fJ%3d27228962&U=13cr9g338%2fN%3dS7s1CEWTWUI-%2fC%3d493064.13983314.13965207.13298430%2fD%3dMKP1%2fB%3d6060255%2fV%3d1\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__JNP_000_5160.6c04.3595\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; \n\tname=&quot;b?P=283dd878-4d8e-11df-b8aa-df516d0c4d54&T=1c9tuatft%2fX%3d1271885880%2fE%3d1705075991%2fR%3dgroups%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d1125392486%2fH%3dY29udGVudD0iRmluYW5jZTtQaG90b3M7RXZlbnRzO0dvO01haWw7QnJpZWZjYXNlO0Jvb2ttYXJrO0hvdGpvYnM7UG9kY2.10835568%2fD%3dMKP1%2fB%3d6042764%2fV%3d1&quot;\r\nContent-Location: http://us.bc.yahoo.com/b?P=283dd878-4d8e-11df-b8aa-df516d0c4d54&T=1c9tuatft%2fX%3d1271885880%2fE%3d1705075991%2fR%3dgroups%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d1125392486%2fH%3dY29udGVudD0iRmluYW5jZTtQaG90b3M7RXZlbnRzO0dvO01haWw7QnJpZWZjYXNlO0Jvb2ttYXJrO0hvdGpvYnM7UG9kY2FzdHM7TWVzc2VuZ2VyOyIgZGlzYWJsZXNodWZmbGluZz0iMSIgc2VydmVJZD0iMjgzZGQ4NzgtNGQ4ZS0xMWRmLWI4YWEtZGY1MTZkMGM0ZDU0IiBzaXRlSWQ9IjI3OTYwNTEiIHRTdG1wPSIxMjcxODg1ODgwMDI0MjIyIiA-%2fQ%3d-1%2fS%3d1%2fJ%3d27228962&U=13c9tqdpm%2fN%3dTLs1CEWTWUI-%2fC%3d493064.13814537.13965224.10835568%2fD%3dMKP1%2fB%3d6042764%2fV%3d1\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__JNP_000_5160.6c04.3595\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; \n\tname=&quot;b?P=283dd878-4d8e-11df-b8aa-df516d0c4d54&T=1c910c03b%2fX%3d1271885880%2fE%3d1705075991%2fR%3dgroups%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d3927275623%2fH%3dY29udGVudD0iRmluYW5jZTtQaG90b3M7RXZlbnRzO0dvO01haWw7QnJpZWZjYXNlO0Jvb2ttYXJrO0hvdGpvYnM7UG9kY2.13298430%2fD%3dMKP1%2fB%3d6015306%2fV%3d1&quot;\r\nContent-Location: http://us.bc.yahoo.com/b?P=283dd878-4d8e-11df-b8aa-df516d0c4d54&T=1c910c03b%2fX%3d1271885880%2fE%3d1705075991%2fR%3dgroups%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d3927275623%2fH%3dY29udGVudD0iRmluYW5jZTtQaG90b3M7RXZlbnRzO0dvO01haWw7QnJpZWZjYXNlO0Jvb2ttYXJrO0hvdGpvYnM7UG9kY2FzdHM7TWVzc2VuZ2VyOyIgZGlzYWJsZXNodWZmbGluZz0iMSIgc2VydmVJZD0iMjgzZGQ4NzgtNGQ4ZS0xMWRmLWI4YWEtZGY1MTZkMGM0ZDU0IiBzaXRlSWQ9IjI3OTYwNTEiIHRTdG1wPSIxMjcxODg1ODgwMDI0MjIyIiA-%2fQ%3d-1%2fS%3d1%2fJ%3d27228962&U=13cgttuqj%2fN%3dTbs1CEWTWUI-%2fC%3d493064.14012770.13963757.13298430%2fD%3dMKP1%2fB%3d6015306%2fV%3d1\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__JNP_000_5160.6c04.3595\r\nContent-Type: image/gif; name=&quot;us.gif&quot;\r\nContent-Location: http://l.yimg.com/a/i/us/yg/logo/us.gif\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__JNP_000_5160.6c04.3595\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;nc3=3848583&quot;\r\nContent-Location: http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=19029015/grpspId=1705075991/msgId=4213/stime=1271885879/nc1=4507179/nc2=5191952/nc3=3848583\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__JNP_000_5160.6c04.3595--\r\n\n"}}
