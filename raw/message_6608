If I may comment , from my own limited intellect and kno=\r\nwledge- Sri Lalitha, Sri Chandika etc are limited concepts of the unlimited=\r\n divine. As the Devi says in the Chandi- &#39;Ekai vasi jagad yatra dvitiya ka =\r\nmama paraa &#39;. She Herself is beyond concepts and beyond the ability of our =\r\nconsciousness to comprehend &#39;jnananam chinmayatita&#39;. They take our mind fro=\r\nm the limited concept, to ultimately dissolve in the unlimited.\n\nThe concep=\r\nt of the Ishta Devatha in bhakti and in the path as taught by my Gurus is t=\r\nhat the Ishta devatha is the para devatha or the all pervading parabrahman =\r\nfor each practitioner. This is borne out by the various Atharva-Sheersham i=\r\nn which the Devatha of the atharva sheersham is considered to be the all pe=\r\nrvading para-brahman. If Lalitha is your Ishta devatha or upasana devatha, =\r\nthen every other devatha( and creation itself) by definition is Her emanati=\r\non and so it is for Chandi, Maha Ganapathy, Shiva, Surya, Narayana etc. \n\nI=\r\nn the south there is an unwarranted fear of &#39;ugra devatha&#39; and also there i=\r\ns a historic influence of certain Shri-kula parampara. In the east, Kali-Ku=\r\nla is more influential.. These are what I would personally consider desha-a=\r\nchara or kula-achara. Having said this, there are lots of Kali, Durga,Bhadr=\r\nakali temples in every southern state, so I feel that these acharas are of =\r\nrelatively recent origin. \n\nI hope this is at least a little bit useful..\n\n=\r\nJaya Devi Durge.\n\nS\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;nag=\r\nraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sri PVRji, \n&gt; \n&gt; While I truly enjoy your br=\r\nilliant posts, with every post of yours, I get really disappointed that my =\r\nquestions never got your attention in the recent past. I posted several tim=\r\nes about lalitha/chandi concepts and so on! Could you please shed light on =\r\nthose. For a quick recap, I repost them here. \n&gt; \n&gt; Durga SapthaSathi does =\r\nnot talk about LalithaDevi or Bhandasura. In which purana do they appear an=\r\nd what is the basis? I know it comes in Brahmanda purana, but my question i=\r\ns if Lalitha Form is superior to Durga form or any confusion like that. I h=\r\nope you understand my ramblings. What I observe is, it is south india we fo=\r\nllow Lalitha worship a lot and in the north this form is not that well know=\r\nn. Can you please shed some light on this ! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On=\r\n Wed, 6/22/11, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR =\r\nRao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: ida & pingala nadis\n&gt; To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 22, 2011, 7:21 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n\n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Pingala nadi (solar channel)=\r\n is the channel of the hot fire of \n&gt; \n&gt; discrimination. Ida nadi (lunar ch=\r\nannel) is the channel of the soothing \n&gt; \n&gt; comfort of feeling. The mantra =\r\nyou do and the praanaayaama you do may \n&gt; \n&gt; have a small impact on which c=\r\nhannel tends to open more, but the primary \n&gt; \n&gt; influence will be your bas=\r\nic attitude and aptitude. Ida nadi is more \n&gt; \n&gt; likely to open in a humble=\r\n, emotional and relaxed person. Pingala nadi \n&gt; \n&gt; is more likely to open i=\r\nn a logical, analytical and intelligent person. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, targeting a nad=\r\ni with praanaayaama and mantra does not add much \n&gt; \n&gt; value.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ga=\r\nyatri mantra tends to open up Pingala more. Shiva mantras (e.g. \n&gt; \n&gt; Panch=\r\nakshari) tend to open Ida more. However, it also depends on how you \n&gt; \n&gt; v=\r\nisualize your god. For example, does Shiva stand for a relaxed mahayogi \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; in bliss to you or the fiery Rudra of destruction?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, the goal is not to make shakti flow through =\r\nIda or Pingala \n&gt; \n&gt; anyway. The goal is that shakti flows through Sushumna=\r\n nadi in the \n&gt; \n&gt; middle. All the higher worlds and deities in them lie wi=\r\nthin Sushumna \n&gt; \n&gt; nadi. Depending on the nature of mantra and your nature=\r\n, Ida or Pingala \n&gt; \n&gt; may open more and some vaayu may be flowing through =\r\nit. But, when \n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini gets awakened oneday, Sushumna may also open =\r\nand Kundalini may \n&gt; \n&gt; shoot up through Sushumna.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Many people r=\r\neferring to Kundalini in higher chakras/nadis are actually \n&gt; \n&gt; talking ab=\r\nout the flow of vaayus there. Most people talking about \n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini hav=\r\ne not experienced Kundalini itself in higher chakras.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini =\r\nshakti is one&#39;s self-awareness. Shakti meeting Shiva is a \n&gt; \n&gt; metaphor fo=\r\nr individual self-awareness (shakti) merging in cosmic self \n&gt; \n&gt; (Shiva). =\r\nA vaishnava may also view it as a Gopi meeting Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shakti will not rise unless one&#39;s awareness of physi=\r\ncal body disappears. \n&gt; \n&gt; The instruction of some teachers to focus on a p=\r\narticular chakra or a \n&gt; \n&gt; particular body part to force Kundalini to rise=\r\n is not wise. As long as \n&gt; \n&gt; you think &quot;I am the body. Inside this body, =\r\nthere is a chakra or a body \n&gt; \n&gt; part. I will focus on that part inside th=\r\nis body&quot;, your self-awareness \n&gt; \n&gt; is unlikely to rise above the physical =\r\nbody. In other words, your \n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini is stuck in the mooladhara chakr=\r\na corresponding to the \n&gt; \n&gt; physical realm.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wanting Kundalini t=\r\no rise to X or Y chakra is unproductive. It never \n&gt; \n&gt; happens that way. W=\r\nhenever I had expected or anticipated something, \n&gt; \n&gt; nothing happened. Th=\r\nings happened spontaneously only when my mind was \n&gt; \n&gt; nearly empty and th=\r\ne focus on mantra/god became so intense that it \n&gt; \n&gt; filled my mind. In fa=\r\nct, when I first experienced a Kundalini rise, I \n&gt; \n&gt; did not even know mu=\r\nch about Kundalini and chakras and considered all \n&gt; \n&gt; those concepts as d=\r\nirty Tantrik ideas that I wanted to do have nothing \n&gt; \n&gt; to do with. Only =\r\nafter experiencing did I understand what it was \n&gt; \n&gt; intellectually. Thus,=\r\n intellectual analysis of Kundalini and chakras and \n&gt; \n&gt; trying to manipul=\r\nate them is unnecessary and, in fact, \n&gt; \n&gt; counter-productive. If you want=\r\n Kundalini to rise, do not even think in \n&gt; \n&gt; terms of Kundalini and chakr=\r\nas.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini rises when and only=\r\n when your self-awareness rises above the \n&gt; \n&gt; physical body. The key is t=\r\no forget that you are the body. The key is to \n&gt; \n&gt; NOT think that you are =\r\n(or you are not) the body. The key is to forget \n&gt; \n&gt; about the body comple=\r\ntely. The key is to immerse the mind so deeply in \n&gt; \n&gt; the mantra/deity th=\r\nat you forget everything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And then patience. By being in a =\r\nhurry that your Kundalini should rise, \n&gt; \n&gt; you will only ensure that Kund=\r\nalini remains in Mooladhara forever. As I \n&gt; \n&gt; said, stop thinking in term=\r\ns of shakti and chakras, if shakti were to \n&gt; \n&gt; really rise.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; \n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n&gt; \n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; \n&gt;       Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; \n&gt;    Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; \n&gt;                       Tw=\r\nitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for answering=\r\n my questions. Some of them have been silly\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; trivial questions, and y=\r\net, you never tire of answering them. I am\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; grateful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nn some of your mails, you have written about the flow of shakti\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; thro=\r\nugh the ida and pingala nadis, and how pranayama and mantra are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; link=\r\ned to them. Is it a better to choose activities which &#39;activate&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n same nadi throughout? For example, if the pradhana homa mantra\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; acti=\r\nvates the ida nadi, is it better to &#39;activate&#39; the same nadi\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; through=\r\n pranayama, and also choose a mantra with works through the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; same nad=\r\ni during meditation?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you have some experience with them, c=\r\nan you share the nadi\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; affiliation for some common mantras like mahag=\r\nanapati (shreem hriim\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; kleem ...), shiva panchakshari, and &#39;om namo n=\r\narayanaya&#39;. Do longer\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; selections like chandi path also have an affil=\r\niation with one of the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; nadis?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you again.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
