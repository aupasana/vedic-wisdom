Thought of mailing them to=\r\n you. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Jumping on conclusion without properly =\r\nstudying/thinking about Thakur&#39;s life, just on literal meaning of those 2 w=\r\nords would be a sure blasphemy.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; You are right. But since t=\r\nhis is a debate and just a debate, =C3=82=C2=A0let me put forth some logica=\r\nl points.=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 1) Two wrongs never make a right. T=\r\nhis is one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When=\r\n we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - wh=\r\no lived in a different century - was right or now. That would be a differen=\r\nt debate. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 2) Ramakrishna did not write anything -:). He o=\r\nnly=C3=82=C2=A0woke up=C3=82=C2=A0people to what ever degree was necessary =\r\nand gave general talks on spirituality. So, one can always contend that a m=\r\nistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Saradananda=C3=82=C2=A0could ver=\r\ny well have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is =\r\ndifferent from creating a composition. When one writes, one has more time a=\r\nnd energy to indulge in thinking, and checking up possibilities of differen=\r\nt shades of meanings for the simple reason that the audience is large, unkn=\r\nown and spread out=C3=82=C2=A0over huge spans of time.=C3=82=C2=A0When one =\r\ntalks, and that too talking to friends, or close people, one does not need =\r\nto be careful of every word or sentence one speaks. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; To un=\r\nderstand this better,=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0we have to think - scientifica=\r\nlly speaking - how communication happens in three levels. Around 33 percent=\r\n of the communication is through the words, 64 percent through body languag=\r\ne and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or sub conscious communication. This l=\r\nast three percent is the most powerful. When a person can use this 3 percen=\r\nt of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of people. All great =\r\nleaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you listen to the lyrics=\r\n of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But if you were to =\r\nbe present in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel an energy and g=\r\net swayed.=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Then comes body language which is =\r\nso important.=C3=82=C2=A0For example,=C3=82=C2=A0if you enter a Govt office=\r\n in India, you may find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in the=\r\nir chair with their spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any =\r\nimpact on them. That is why the files in Govt. of India offices move at a=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0snail&#39;s pace.=C3=82=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are =\r\ntalking to=C3=82=C2=A0is sitting cross legged on a chair, with left leg cro=\r\nssing the right, even if the person may hang on eagerly to every word you s=\r\npeak, know it for the sure that there is a strong change he is listening th=\r\nrough one ear and throwing out the words through the other. In short, prete=\r\nnding to listen. In effect, once you leave his presence he probably=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0won&#39; t bother about what you said.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; And last is spoke=\r\nn word. When two people speak with each other, both words and body language=\r\n come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious communication too can happen. T=\r\nherefore there is a LOT of the energy exchanged/communica tion not through =\r\nwords but through other means. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; When you write down someth=\r\ning, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be extra cautious=\r\n while writing something in order to convey the correct sense. That is why =\r\nthere are so many more rules to be followed=C3=82=C2=A0for writing anything=\r\n.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; So therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; to someone he =\r\nis probably communicating using all means possible. But if he were to write=\r\n a book and mention &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without further explanation of wha=\r\nt he intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. But he never w=\r\nrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they explained the sense=\r\n. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Contrast this to that line from Ramacharit Manas, witho=\r\nut any qualifications, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are worthy of=\r\n &quot;tadan&quot;.=C3=82=C2=A0 If I were a woman, I would take offense=C3=82=C2=A0to=\r\n that line.=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 3) Whenever I am doing a critic o=\r\nf a religious literature, I keep the Koran as a standard. By this I mean, w=\r\nhenever I am judging a book of religious nature, I follow the same paramete=\r\nrs of judgement that I use when I judge the Koran as a book.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; The Koran contains a verse, translated correctly in the M.A. Shakir and =\r\nDawood translations, which recommend husbands to beat their wives if the wi=\r\nves are disobedient. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Men are the maintainers of women=\r\n because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend=\r\n out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the=\r\n unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear dese=\r\nrtion, admonish them, and leave them alone in their sleeping places and bea=\r\nt them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah=\r\n is High, Great. (Shakir&#39;s version of the Koran, Quran, 4:34) \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; A lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the above=C3=82=C2=A0giving=\r\n various reasons one of which is &#39;misunderstanding context&#39;. I find it inex=\r\ncusable. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing &quot;nari&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot;, &quot;s=\r\nudra&quot; together, I find=C3=82=C2=A0to be equally inexcusable. That is the se=\r\nnse that comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not commenting =\r\non the whole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n[Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur=C3=82=C2=A0Par-stri Matusamaan|\n&gt; Inase ag=\r\nar prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||\n&gt; (I have given=C3=82=C2=A0this =\r\ndoha =C3=82=C2=A0out of memory and its quite possible that first two=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0wrods are wrong in the doha )=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Interestin=\r\ng doha.

Let me try again. He is not really saying that Sri Rama wa=\r\ns not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avat=\r\nar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Go=\r\nd did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended in or=\r\nder to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A path t=\r\nhat an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabhara=\r\nta, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Whenever, according to him, we attrib=\r\nute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divid=\r\ne between the worshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to =\r\nlead a life like Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a =\r\ngreat king, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of =\r\nfollowing such a life.\n&gt; &gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God bu=\r\nt he can follow the life of a great man.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one should try to become =\r\nlike Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanad=\r\nas in teh future.

He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have=\r\n destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the p=\r\nlace where he was=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did n=\r\not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human wa=\r\ny.

An =\r\nauthor&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a =\r\ncritics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with =\r\nanimals or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text b=\r\necause Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ende=\r\nd up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if S=\r\nri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste=\r\n. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be w=\r\norshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane.

As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding =\r\nout the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He =\r\nhas worked in different fields, from banking to education to journalism. He=\r\n did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, Engli=\r\nsh, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is lear=\r\nning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he was in c=\r\nollege, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a job he had k=\r\nept the place makered for religion as blank. When\n the clerk who was suppos=\r\ned to take the forms\n&gt; saw that blank space,\n&gt; &gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s=\r\n name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my frien=\r\nd snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Because, he =\r\nconsidered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would have been=\r\n a lie. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of.

His way to office passed by a =\r\nKrishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go =\r\ninto the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temp=\r\nle, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his=\r\n watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time w=\r\nent. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple=\r\n sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement=\r\n. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea =\r\nwhy this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then he=\r\n started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does n=\r\not say much about these, infact most people who know him also do not know t=\r\nhese things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his m=\r\neditation seat, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days contin=\r\nuously.=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 Only hi=\r\ns wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays whe=\r\nn ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When so=\r\nmeone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the=\r\n whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the p=\r\nlanets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, =\r\nsmaller than the atom and bigger than everything.

One cannot become Krishna, b=\r\nut one=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0can try t=\r\no lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merel=\r\ny stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, a=\r\nnd advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he i=\r\ns not an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later he had once=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0mentioned he knew the relation he had with all t=\r\nhe people around him in his past lives.

Thought of mailing\n them to you. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Jumping on conclusion without properly studying/thinking=\r\n about Thakur&#39;s life, just on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a s=\r\nure blasphemy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You are right. But since this i=\r\ns a debate and just a debate, =C3=82&nbsp;let me put forth some logical poi=\r\nnts.=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Two wrongs never make a r=\r\night. This is one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over somethin=\r\ng. When we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrish=\r\nna - who lived in a different century - was right or now. That would be a d=\r\nifferent debate. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Ramakrishna did not write=\r\n anything -:). He only=C3=82&nbsp;woke up=C3=82&nbsp;people to what ever de=\r\ngree was necessary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, one can alwa=\r\nys contend that a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Saradananda=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;could very well have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving\n a=\r\n freewheeling talk is different from creating a composition. When one write=\r\ns, one has more time and energy to indulge in thinking, and checking up pos=\r\nsibilities of different shades of meanings for the simple reason that the a=\r\nudience is large, unknown and spread out=C3=82&nbsp;over huge spans of time=\r\n.=C3=82&nbsp;When one talks, and that too talking to friends, or close peop=\r\nle, one does not need to be careful of every word or sentence one speaks. &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To understand this better,=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;we have to think - scientifically speaking - how communication happens =\r\nin three levels. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the word=\r\ns, 64 percent through body language and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or s=\r\nub conscious communication. This last three percent is the most powerful. W=\r\nhen a person can use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can=\r\n move masses of people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so =\r\n(IMO). If\n you listen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find =\r\nit uninspiring. But if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you w=\r\nill definitely feel an energy and get swayed.=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then comes body language which is so important.=C3=82&nbsp;For=\r\n example,=C3=82&nbsp;if you enter a Govt office in India, you may find that=\r\n the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with their spine re=\r\nclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. That is why =\r\nthe files in Govt. of India offices move at a=C3=82&nbsp;snail&#39;s pace.=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;If you find that someone whom you are talking to=C3=82&nbsp;is sit=\r\nting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the=\r\n person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure t=\r\nhat there is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing o=\r\nut the words through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, =\r\nonce you leave his presence he\n probably=C3=82&nbsp;won&#39; t bother about wha=\r\nt you said.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And last is spoken word. When two =\r\npeople speak with each other, both words and body language come into pictur=\r\ne. Sometimes sub conscious communication too can happen. Therefore there is=\r\n a LOT of the energy exchanged/communica tion not through words but through=\r\n other means. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you write down something, =\r\nbody languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be extra cautious whil=\r\ne writing something in order to convey the correct sense. That is why there=\r\n are so many more rules to be followed=C3=82&nbsp;for writing anything.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; So therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; to some=\r\none he is probably communicating using all means possible. But if he were t=\r\no write a book and mention &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without further explanation=\r\n of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. But he =\r\nnever wrote any books, and the authors who\n did, made sure they explained t=\r\nhe sense. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Contrast this to that line from Ram=\r\nacharit Manas, without any qualifications, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;=\r\npashu&quot; are worthy of &quot;tadan&quot;.=C3=82&nbsp; If I were a woman, I would take o=\r\nffense=C3=82&nbsp;to that line.=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3=\r\n) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious literature, I keep the Koran =\r\nas a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am judging a book of religious na=\r\nture, I follow the same parameters of judgement that I use when I judge the=\r\n Koran as a book.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The Koran contains a verse, =\r\ntranslated correctly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translations, which reco=\r\nmmend husbands to beat their wives if the wives are disobedient. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Men are the maintainers of women because All=\r\nah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of thei=\r\nr property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the\n unseen as =\r\nAllah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admo=\r\nnish them, and leave them alone in their sleeping places and beat them; the=\r\nn if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, G=\r\nreat. (Shakir&#39;s version of the Koran, Quran, 4:34) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; A lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the above=C3=82&nbsp;giving=\r\n various reasons one of which is &#39;misunderstanding context&#39;. I find it inex=\r\ncusable. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing &quot;nari&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot;, &quot;s=\r\nudra&quot; together, I find=C3=82&nbsp;to be equally inexcusable. That is the se=\r\nnse that comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not commenting =\r\non the whole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; [Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur=C3=82&nbsp;Par-stri Matusamaan=\r\n|&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Inase agar prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (I hav=\r\ne given=C3=82&nbsp;this doha =C3=82&nbsp;out of memory and its quite possib=\r\nle that\n first two=C3=82&nbsp;wrods are wrong in the doha )=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Interesting doha. Maybe you are right, maybe you =\r\nare not. But that line (pashu/naari etc)=C3=82&nbsp;definitely conveys a si=\r\nmple meaning. If=C3=82&nbsp;Tulasidasji ment what you are saying, he should=\r\n have used some appropiate punctuation marks. Since he did not, I have to r=\r\neject your explanation. Or I can say, Tulasidasji respects women a lot, but=\r\n that line is simply a bad composition. One way or the other, I cannot abso=\r\nlve the composer of that specific line.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW,=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; were you refering to the Gita verse 1.41 where Arjuna talks ab=\r\nout women of the family getting corrupted?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You=\r\n and I&#39;ve notably common Astrological factors in our chart.

Refre=\r\nshing phrase.=C3=82&nbsp; Too good. It seems a season of debating. Branches=\r\n of threads are coming out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &#39;Kamini and `Kanchan&#39; was the exact wor=\r\nds which=C3=82&nbsp;Ramakrishna used freely during his life time. Now Kamin=\r\ni means a woman and its possible that several sections would have taken res=\r\nervation at this. That\n seems very obvious otherwise why Swami Sardananda r=\r\nequired to defend Thakur in his book called Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga. It se=\r\nemed to me that Paramahansa Yogananda also have referred to this issue with=\r\nout mentioning Thakur&#39;s name directly (I may be wrong but i strongly felt l=\r\nike that when i read the &#39;Autobiography of a yogi&#39; some 4/5 years back). Sa=\r\nrdanada in a sense did &#39;Back engineering job to bail out :)&#39;=C3=82&nbsp;. I=\r\nf we go by &#39;Kamini&#39; word=C3=82&nbsp;literaly, then Thakur=C3=82&nbsp;could =\r\nbe portrayed as Women basher.=C3=82&nbsp; but we all know that Thakur refff=\r\nered to Lust and=C3=82&nbsp;Desire of=C3=82&nbsp;worldly objects whenever h=\r\ne spoke those two words. Jumping on conclusion without properly studying/th=\r\ninking about Thakur&#39;s life, just on literal meaning of those 2 words would =\r\nbe a sure blasphemy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Same way, I also thought about Sant Tulasi das=\r\n ji. I=C3=82&nbsp;was telling=C3=82&nbsp;myself that can a saint of his dev=\r\notion and poetic skills and add to that\n steadfastly devoted to Lord Rama (=\r\nWho never shown slightest dis-resepct to =C3=82&nbsp;women) , utter such wo=\r\nrds and saggrigate &#39;Nari&#39; for nothing.

As=\r\n you pointed out,=C3=82&nbsp; on a look at surface (at the levelof text), i=\r\nt means which many belives but you and me need to look at little deeper. A =\r\nperson who did the world of Good to Indias ordinary masses by rewriting the=\r\n whole Ramayana in a language which people (from north) could easily unders=\r\ntand, The man who gave immortal &#39;Hanumaan Chalisa&#39; can not be\n lebeled so c=\r\nasually as &#39;Nari basher&#39; or &#39;Shudra Hater&#39; (As Mayaavati brand poticians wo=\r\nuld capitalise).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding your questions of why Pashu are only Nar=\r\ni and not Nara ....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I think he was reffering=C3=82&nbsp;to=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp; Men with the words Ganvaar and Shudra=C3=82&nbsp;and Pashu Nari must be=\r\n a joint statement. Again as you already know, Shudra was not B.C., OBC, KB=\r\nC, HSBC etc.. :-). but a fallen man, a mean thinking man. I have to agree i=\r\nf you say that Ganvaar and Shudra can also be said about Woaman=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\nhowever looking at the Doha and general=C3=82&nbsp;prevailing conditions of=\r\n society, it seems that he used those words for Men.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gr=\r\nammar...Hmmmm. i don&#39;t know if he has really used proper grammer in such Do=\r\nhas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are=C3=82&nbsp;verse in Bhagvad Gita which=C3=82&nbsp;ca=\r\nn be criticised by people from other faiths if they are taken literaly and =\r\nwithout understanding personality of Krishna .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regardin=\r\ng\n Ramachandra, Thank you for making clear, your notable friend&#39;s view and =\r\nyour detailed explanation by giving examples. =C3=82&nbsp;But again i don&#39;t=\r\n think that to consider Rama as God will actually be blockage in leading li=\r\nfe like him and that too when almost everybody in Sanatan Dharma knows him =\r\nas God.
