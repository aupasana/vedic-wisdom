(say for example: &quot;If \n&gt; a  Brahmana disassociates himself from  low=\r\ner caste people and \n&gt; associates only with higher caste people, he attains=\r\n greatness.&quot;) \n \nOn the contrary, there have been notable Brahmanas who hav=\r\ne associated themselves with &quot;lower caste people&quot;, changed them into Brahma=\r\nnas and arguably &quot;attained greatness&quot;.\n \nWhen Srila Prabhupada, for example=\r\n, came to the West and taught Krishna Bhakti to all and sundry with compass=\r\nion and without differentiating a drug addict hippie from a religious schol=\r\nar, he sowed the seed for one of the greatest bhakti movements ever. I marv=\r\nel when I look at how many Brahmanas of a very high order have been created=\r\n as a result of his selfless and compassionate actions! Imagine a 69 year o=\r\nld man walking barefooted on the streets of a very cold foreign city filled=\r\n with men of material pursuits and wondering how to start the mission of es=\r\ntablishing devotion to Krishna there! Only a man whose heart is devoted to =\r\nKrishna and his Guru can do it.\n \nUpasani maharaj, who lived a century ago,=\r\n was a great scholar of Vedas and Upanishads. Shirdi Sai Baba once called h=\r\nim god himself in a human body and did ritual worship to him. He once went =\r\nand lived in Harijanawada (colony of untouchables) with harijans (untouchab=\r\nles) and did things like sweeping the floors with them. He taught Vedic kno=\r\nwledge to harijans and women.\n \nJnaneshwar Maharaj pleaded with the learned=\r\n Brahmanas and keepers of dharma at Paithan to interpret dharma shastras wi=\r\nth compassion and wisdom. When they failed and the Brahmanas of Alandi cont=\r\ninued to consider his family (of three brothers and a sister, considered as=\r\n incarnations of Trinity and Shakti) outcastes, he went and lived with lowe=\r\nr caste people and taught his Marathi translation of Bhagavad Gita to them =\r\nfirst. He was first adored by lower caste people and Brahmanas came to him =\r\nlater. Irrespective of caste, so many people in western India are influence=\r\nd in their thinking and attitude by Jnaneshwar Maharaj today! His interpret=\r\nation of Bhagavad Gita is arguably the best ever.\n \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa=\r\n was orthodox in the beginning. Though he worshipped Mother Kaali at the te=\r\nmple, he refused to eat Her prasad (food offered to Her and eaten by devote=\r\nes later) as it was not cooked by a Braahmana! He left after the pooja with=\r\nout taking prasad and ate food cooked by himself. Such barriers were broken=\r\n down later as he realized Self. He requested a rich landlord to give him a=\r\n lower caste servant he had with him and turned that boy into a saint of a =\r\nvery high order. Despite being illiterate, Swami Adbhutananda (Latu Maharaj=\r\n) had spiritual experiences and spiritual realization that many Brahmanas w=\r\nho spend their entire lives memorizing Vedas and Upanishads cannot even fat=\r\nhom. When the young man was meditating in the muggy Calcutta weather and wa=\r\ns profusely sweating, there were times when Ramakrishna himself sat in fron=\r\nt of him and fanned him! Such was his love for the young sadhaka from a low=\r\ner caste. Ramakrishna also freely associated with fallen drunkards (e.g. Gi=\r\nrish and Kalipad) and turned them into devoted men of god. He once took the=\r\n &quot;karmik power of attorney&quot; from Girish and told him, &quot;you are free to do w=\r\nhatever you want. Drink, pursue women and do whatever you want. Nothing wil=\r\nl happen to you. Each bad karma performed by you will come to me.&quot; Girish c=\r\nontinued his debauched lifestyle for some more time, but reformed later. Wh=\r\nenever he did something bad, he could not stand the thought that Ramakrishn=\r\na was to receive the karmik punishment. So he reformed. In later days, Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda held Girish in great respect and Girish touched many lives. T=\r\nhough some believe that Ramakrishna&#39;s throat cancer was because of taking o=\r\nn Girish&#39;s karmas, obviously he thought it was worth it. It had several pur=\r\nposes.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDharma is not a constant.\n \nDharma is the ri=\r\nght thing one should do. The right action changes from person to person and=\r\n from time to time. The right action is a function of one&#39;s cumulative back=\r\nground through many lives. It is possible to lay down some generic guidelin=\r\nes, but they can never be perfect. They need to be adopted with time.\n \n***=\r\n Dry rice grains cannot be eaten and digested, but they stay fresh longer w=\r\nithout getting spoiled. Cooked rice is ready to eat and digest, but it beco=\r\nmes stale faster. ***\n \nSimilarly, non-specific and unprocessed guidelines =\r\n(that need to be processed in order to digest, i.e. put to use) remain appl=\r\nicable longer, while specific and processed guidelines (that can be put to =\r\nuse right away) become stale faster and lose their relevance. For example, =\r\na statement that god is everywhere and one should see happiness and sadness=\r\n alike is timeless and never expires (like uncooked dry rice grains). But w=\r\nhat do you do with it? How do you put it into practice? It is not specific.=\r\n On the other hand, a specific guideline that one should do so and so ritua=\r\nl or not do so and so action is specific to a time and may not apply after =\r\nsome time.\n \nThe bane of many religions that are based on one prophet and o=\r\nne text is that the text may become stale after some time. It may have been=\r\n perfect for a previous time, but it may be imperfect now.\n \nThough we have=\r\n texts in sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) also that preach specific time-lim=\r\nited dos and donts, we have several texts that also spread the timeless tea=\r\nchings. So sometimes things may seem contradictory. Moreover, people transl=\r\nating things do not always get it right. Words are just words. A meaning is=\r\n the imagery generated by those words in the mind of a reader, which is con=\r\ntrolled by the mental conditioning of that reader.\n \nLuckily, sanatana dhar=\r\nma is not based on one prophet or one text and individual sadhana for indiv=\r\nidual Self-realization is emphasized. We have a steady stream of Self-reali=\r\nzed saints and yogis, who interpret the words of shastras to us, through th=\r\neir own words and deeds!\n \nThey reject the cooked grains that became stale =\r\n(i.e. sometimes break orthodox rules), take uncooked grains from shastra (t=\r\nimeless principles), cook them with the heat of their spiritual understandi=\r\nng and serve the cooked food of spiritual instruction to people through the=\r\nir words and actions.\n \nThus, I will say to people who have a fancy for sha=\r\nstras, &quot;Read shastras, but do keep the above in mind and distinguish betwee=\r\nn uncooked grains and grains that were cooked long back and may have become=\r\n stale by now. Try to supplement your understanding of shastras using the w=\r\nords and deeds of saints like Aadi Shankara, Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Chaitanya =\r\nMahaprabhu, Raghavendra Swami, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Para=\r\nmahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Srila Prabhupada etc. Words of a realized person =\r\nautomatically become scripture.&quot;\n \n*        *        *\n \nCaste is a touchy =\r\ntopic. Unfortunately, neither orthodox people nor politically correct ratio=\r\nnalists get it completely correct.\n \nCaste is based on one&#39;s attitude and i=\r\nnternal value system. To a braahmana, self-realization is the goal in life.=\r\n To a kshatriya, power and authority over others is the goal in life. To a =\r\nvaisya, money is the goal. To a shudra, basic physical comforts are the goa=\r\nl.\n \nHowever, one&#39;s birth and environment do influence one&#39;s value system.\n=\r\n \nIf one is born and grows up amid people who value strength, valor, vanqui=\r\nshing others and exerting power and authority over others, there is a good =\r\nchance that one will also start valuing those qualities. In other words, if=\r\n one is born and grows up amid kshatriyas, there is a good chance that one =\r\nwill become a kshatriya oneself!\n \nThat cannot be denied. Thus, there is a =\r\ngood chance that one will end up with the value system of one&#39;s caste of bi=\r\nrth.\n \nHowever, there can be exceptions. Based on other rinas from previous=\r\n lives and life circumstances, one&#39;s attitude can change from that indicate=\r\nd by the family one is born into. After all, a king like Vishwamitra can be=\r\ncome a great braahmana and brahma jnaani and a shudra like Vaalmiki can bec=\r\nome a great braahmana and brahma jnaani. Thus, while the caste of birth is =\r\nan important factor, it is not the only one. Caste mobility is possible bas=\r\ned on other circumstances faced in one&#39;s life.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAlso=\r\n, if a braahmana (a person interested in spiritual progress and self-realiz=\r\nation) associates with a shudra (a person interested in bodily comforts), t=\r\nhere is a chance that the former is influenced by the latter and becomes in=\r\nterested in physical pleasures. Such an attachment to the body may take one=\r\n off the course of self-realization. Thus, you can see where the quote from=\r\n Manu Smriti is coming from.\n \nHowever, making that a rigid rule is debatab=\r\nle. Not every yogi who associates with a shudra develops attachment to body=\r\n and its comforts. On the contrary, one may change the shudra and make him =\r\nrealize that body is temporary and not worth worrying so much about. Throug=\r\nh the association, he may convert the shudra into a purified devotee of god=\r\n.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRead things, but have a sense of balance in under=\r\nstanding various dictums of shastra. At the end, there are infinite people =\r\nin this world and infinite viewpoints. We are not responsible for all their=\r\n views. Make sure that your understanding of various things is clear and co=\r\nnsistent.\n \nMake sure that you are making spiritual progress and slowly ove=\r\nrcoming ego and attachment to the body. Make sure that your devotion to god=\r\n is increasing and devotion to body and its comforts is decreasing. Make su=\r\nre that your understanding of what is perennial vs what is temporary is inc=\r\nreasing and your attachment to temporary things is decreasing. If all these=\r\n things are happening, then you are on the right course and will sooner or =\r\nlater realize what is worth realizing.\n \nThat is the most important thing a=\r\nnd other things are secondary. Let other people do what they see as their j=\r\nob, as long as they do not interfere with what you see as your dharma.\n \nBe=\r\nst regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=\r\nam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n \n---- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sri G =\r\nBalasubramanian Ji,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I appreciate your efforts of posting these materi=\r\nal, but i&#39;m not able to understand the motive or the reason behind these po=\r\nstings.

The same   smruti   also says that such=\r\n Brahmanas become degraded by associating with fallen people(patita-samsarg=\r\naat)   at their place of work.  That Smruti declares, &quot; If a  Brahmana disa=\r\nssociates himself from  lower caste people and associates only with higher =\r\ncaste people, he attains greatness.  If he does the opposite, he becomes a =\r\n sudra(Manu4. 245).  Knowledgeable people hold the view that many of the pr=\r\nofessions like  software engineering , technological jobs,a  Govt. servant(=\r\nraja sevaka),  a teacher working in a school, a doctor etc. etc. --- all of=\r\n these professions fall under the category of  sudra`s  domain.  They hold =\r\nthat a Brahmin should not take employment from anyone (especially from sudr=\r\nas).  In this regard  the Kurma Purana   says---\n&gt; &quot;Those Brahmanas who mak=\r\ne a living from protecting cows, engage in trade, become artists, take the =\r\noccupation of servants, and lend money on interest are no better than sudra=\r\ns (......... vipran  sudra-vad acharet).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;O Brahmanas, one who does n=\r\not study the  Vedas (anadhitya sruti dvijah)  but carefully endeavours for =\r\nother pursuits is certainly foolish( sa sammudo) and ostracized from vedic =\r\nlife( veda-bahyo dvijatibhih).  Brahmanas  should not speak to such a perso=\r\nn&quot;(na sambhasyo). \n&gt; \n&gt; But, Srimad Bhagavatam   speaks of  a permissible  =\r\nexception  and  mentions the circumstances in which a Brahmana may pursue  =\r\nanother occupation.  Verse 47 of chapter 17 of Canto 11 says that if a Brah=\r\nmana  can not support himself through his regular duties and is suffering,h=\r\ne  may adopt the occupation of a merchant  and overcome his destitute condi=\r\ntion by buying and selling material things.  If he continues to suffer extr=\r\neme poverty even as a merchant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kshat=\r\nriya.  But under no circumstances become like a dog, accepting an ordinary =\r\nmaster. Srimad Bhagavatam (12.3.35) also states  that this is one of the sy=\r\nmptoms of Kaliyuga. It says,&quot; Businessmen will engage in petty commerce and=\r\n earn their money by cheating. Even when there is no emergency, people will=\r\n consider any degraded occupation quite acceptable.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Dharma Sastras=\r\n  declare that if one takes birth in a Brahmana  family but does not cultiv=\r\nate scriptural knowledge, he can not be accepted as a Brahmana.  Visnu Dhar=\r\nma Sastra 93.7 says that religious- minded  people should never give even a=\r\n drop of water to the hypocritical son of a   Brahmana,  who is ignorant of=\r\n the Vedas.  Manu Smriti 2.157   says that a brahmana  who does not study t=\r\nhe  Vedas  is  similar to a wooden elephant or a deer made of skin, i.e.,  =\r\nan elephant or deer only in name but does not function effectively as such.=\r\n  Moreover,  the same   smriti  says that until a  Brahmana  qualifies hims=\r\nelf in the  Vedas, he is on the same level as a sudra(2.172 Sudrena hi sama=\r\nh tavad  yavad vede na jayate). In Mahabharata, Santi Parva 189.7  it has b=\r\neen stated that Brahmanas who lead a life of violence, lies and greed, who =\r\nare impure and indulge in all kinds of  karmic  activity in order to mainta=\r\nin their\n&gt;  lives(sarvakarmopajivinah ) are degraded to the status of sudra=\r\ns(dvija sudratam gatah).  Such a person , who eats anything and everything =\r\nwithout discrimination, who is attached to worldly things, who will accept =\r\nany occupation just to make money(sarvo karma karo asuchih), who has given =\r\nup Vedic  Dharma (tyakta vedastvanarchah)  and proper behaviour is called  =\r\na  sudra (sa vai sudra iti smrutah).  Let each one of our community weigh o=\r\nur  respective merit and  conclude as to where we are as Brahmins.\n&gt; (to be=\r\n continued)\n&gt; G.Balasubramanian\n\n\n"}}
