If this universe is the manifestation of an alm=\r\nost infinite amount of\nenergy, when this universe was in a state of Pralaya=\r\n, it must have\nrepresented the same amount of involved energy. It cannot ha=\r\nve been\notherwise. As such, it follows that every soul is infinite. From th=\r\ne lowest\nworm that crawls under our feet to the noblest and greatest saints=\r\n, all have\nthis infinite power, infinite purity, and infinite everything. O=\r\nnly the\ndifference is in the degree of manifestation. The worm is only mani=\r\nfesting\njust a little bit of that energy, you have manifested more, another=\r\n god-man\nhas manifested still more: that is all the difference. But that in=\r\nfinite\npower is there all the same. Says Patanjali: =97 &quot;Like the peasant i=\r\nrrigating\nhis field.&quot;\n\nThere is no such thing as individuality in this litt=\r\nle world of ours, the\nJagat. Thought and feeling, mind and body, men and an=\r\nimals and plants are in\na continuous state of flux. But suppose you take th=\r\ne universe as a unit\nwhole; can it change or move? Certainly not. Motion is=\r\n possible in\ncomparison with something which is a little less in motion or =\r\nentirely\nmotionless. The universe as a whole, therefore, is motionless, unc=\r\nhangeable.\nYou are therefore, an individual then and then alone when you ar=\r\ne the whole\nof it, when the realization of &quot;I am the universe&quot; comes. That =\r\nis why the\nVedantist says that so long as there are two, fear does not ceas=\r\ne. It is\nonly when one does not see another, does not feel another, when it=\r\n is all\none =97 then alone fear ceases, then alone death vanishes, then alo=\r\nne Samsara\nvanishes.\n\nIf there is a wrestling match, who enjoys it, those w=\r\nho take part in it, or\nthose who are looking on =97 the outsiders? The more=\r\n and more you are the\nwitness of anything in life, the more you enjoy it. A=\r\nnd this is =C2nanda; and,\ntherefore, infinite bliss can only be yours when =\r\nyou have become the witness\nof this universe; then alone you are a Mukta Pu=\r\nrusha. It is the witness\nalone that can work without any desire, without an=\r\ny idea of going to heaven,\nwithout any idea of blame, without any idea of p=\r\nraise. The witness alone\nenjoys, and none else.\n\n\nBelieve, therefore, in yo=\r\nurselves. The secret of Advaita is: Believe in\nyourselves first, and then b=\r\nelieve in anything else. In the history of the\nworld, you will find that on=\r\nly those nations that have believed in\nthemselves have become great and str=\r\nong. In the history of each nation, you\nwill always find that only those in=\r\ndividuals who have believed in themselves\nhave become great and strong.\n\nTh=\r\nis is teaching on the practical side. Believe, therefore, in yourselves,\nan=\r\nd if you want material wealth, work it out; it will come to you. If you\nwan=\r\nt to be intellectual, work it out on the intellectual plane, and\nintellectu=\r\nal giants you shall be. And if you want to attain to freedom, work\nit out o=\r\nn the spiritual plane, and free you shall be and shall enter into\nNirvana, =\r\nthe Eternal Bliss.\n\nYoung men of Lahore, understand this, therefore, this g=\r\nreat sin hereditary\nand national, is on our shoulders. There is no hope for=\r\n us. You may make\nthousands of societies, twenty thousand political assembl=\r\nages, fifty\nthousand institutions. These will be of no use until there is t=\r\nhat sympathy,\nthat love, that heart that thinks for all; until Buddha&#39;s hea=\r\nrt comes once\nmore into India, until the words of the Lord Krishna are brou=\r\nght to their\npractical use, there is no hope for us.\n\nWhat matters it if th=\r\nis little life goes? Everyone has to die, the saint or\nthe sinner, the rich=\r\n or the poor. The body never remains for anyone. Arise\nand awake and be per=\r\nfectly sincere. Our insincerity in India is awful; what\nwe want is characte=\r\nr, that steadiness and character that make a man cling on\nto a thing like g=\r\nrim death.\n\nWhen the Mohammedans first came into India, what a great number=\r\n of Hindus\nwere here; but mark, how today they have dwindled down! Every da=\r\ny they will\nbecome less and less till they wholly disappear. Let them disap=\r\npear, but\nwith them will disappear the marvellous ideas, of which, with all=\r\n their\ndefects and all their misrepresentations, they still stand as\nrepres=\r\nentatives. And with them will disappear this marvellous Advaita, the\ncrest-=\r\njewel of all spiritual thought. Therefore, arise, awake, with your\nhands st=\r\nretched out to protect the spirituality of the world. And first of\nall, wor=\r\nk it out for your own country. What we want is not so much\nspirituality as =\r\na little of the bringing down of the Advaita into the\nmaterial world. First=\r\n bread and then religion.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Comple=\r\nte_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/The_=\r\nVedanta\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And L=\r\nove Alone\n\r\n--00163600d59dcc4df804724262de\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(=\r\n51, 51, 51); &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;THE VEDANTA (Delivered at =\r\nLahore on 12th November, 1897)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;=\r\n &quot;&gt;Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Buddha=\r\n is the evolved amoeba, the amoeba was the involved Buddha also.
