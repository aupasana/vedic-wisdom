However, Manish did not re=\r\nveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that time was =\r\nthat Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a s=\r\nimple procedure to him.\n\nI experimented with homam, started doing occasiona=\r\nlly and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing i=\r\nt daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original task - teachin=\r\ng Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsigh=\r\nt, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are abl=\r\ne to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have benefited =\r\n(and will benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, all this started =\r\nfor Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people=\r\n across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..\n\n* * *\n\nIt was =\r\nprobably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what =\r\nthe Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would&#39;ve been diff=\r\nerent while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also h=\r\nurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took=\r\n my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down witho=\r\nut many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I re=\r\nally benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would h=\r\nave had more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made=\r\n the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan=\r\n.\n\nManish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to handle =\r\nthe information and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manual as =\r\nasked by him then.\n\n* * *\n\nA good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary i=\r\nnformation that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.\n=\r\n\nOne day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day med=\r\nitating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came=\r\n out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he =\r\nonly said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on =\r\ntill 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for ba=\r\nth and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I w=\r\nas basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. =\r\nIt was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the=\r\n day.\n\nI noticed on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya=\r\n (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very auspicious day and it i=\r\ns believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful t=\r\nhan on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect d=\r\nay for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with exc=\r\nitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I d=\r\nid not tell you because knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have =\r\nbeen excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement w=\r\nould&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;\n=\r\n\nHe was absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. T=\r\nhe ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. =\r\nIf I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve=\r\n increased the pride and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saatt=\r\nwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one=\r\n makes excellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After =\r\nhearing Manish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still aliv=\r\ne and kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!=\r\n\n\nLucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is usefu=\r\nl rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone=\r\n else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that t=\r\nhey can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it through con=\r\nscious effort.\n\n* * *\n\nI remember one more similar incident. Before the sha=\r\nta chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddh=\r\na (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name =\r\nof one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would=\r\n do some important work in this birth.\n\nWhen I saw Manish later that day, I=\r\n mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, =\r\ndo you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity=\r\n of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasi=\r\nmha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take gre=\r\nat effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if that chall=\r\nenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new identity to feed=\r\n your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it is no=\r\nt useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;\n\nHow tr=\r\nue and wise!\n\n* * *\n\nJust as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and w=\r\neak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sens=\r\ne of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the ene=\r\nrgy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed the lean=\r\n dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and increase de=\r\ntachment.\n\nManish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple poi=\r\nnts he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual=\r\n evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, lik=\r\ne many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He wou=\r\nld say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust o=\r\nn the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/S=\r\nhe wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (=\r\nego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we =\r\nmay be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n\n* * *\n\nHomam and othe=\r\nr spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should also try to intr=\r\nospect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pi=\r\nll. For most people, this does not take just a single moment or day or mont=\r\nh or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start =\r\nwalking on the path and not worry about the progress and the distance left.=\r\n One who keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.\n\nThe point=\r\n I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) and the inte=\r\nrnal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. After a whi=\r\nle, there will be synergy between them and they will start to work together=\r\n very effectively.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@=\r\n gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regardi=\r\nng fire getting extinguished (or anything similar to it), it\n&gt; happens with=\r\n all beginners and its only practice which makes one\n&gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliy=\r\nuga, along with\n&gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path =\r\nfor most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru =\r\nwhom I also\n&gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata=\r\n Chandi\n&gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking=\r\n!\n&gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then\n=\r\n&gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on\n&gt; t=\r\nhe net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took\n&gt; it u=\r\np and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then\n&gt; reminded me o=\r\nf the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely\n&gt; in Samskrit and=\r\n illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between\n&gt; an instruction and =\r\nsloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally\n&gt; performed a longer ver=\r\nsion of the homam and I particpated in it, but\n&gt; never could grasp it. I th=\r\nen asked Narasimha to guide me, which he\n&gt; did, but still it did not get th=\r\nrough my really dense brains :). I\n&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars we=\r\nre such that I never gave up,\n&gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Gan=\r\nesha, that If he really\n&gt; intends that I perform the homa, then he should k=\r\nindly show me the\n&gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that h=\r\ne has decided\n&gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just =\r\ncouldnt\n&gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for hi=\r\ns\n&gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; bab=\r\ny-steps and making progress everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and =\r\nthe all the divine forces for helping\n&gt; me progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; My request, pls d=\r\nont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We\n&gt; are humans and prone t=\r\no mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very\n&gt; first time, unless he ha=\r\ns worked on it a lot in his previous lives.\n&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont wor=\r\nry about time, we have future lives ...\n&gt; plenty of time. These things take=\r\n their own sweet time, doesnt happen\n&gt; overnight. No matter what, complete =\r\nyour homa everyday, that should be\n&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls=\r\n dont waver from it, whether you\n&gt; get or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll p=\r\nrogress in our Sadhana and\n&gt; move on to higher things. I wish all the best.=\r\n We should really thank\n&gt; our stars that people like Manishji and Narasimha=\r\nji are here guiding\n&gt; us ... what would be life without them!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks f=\r\nor listening.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; -Narayan-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu=\r\n !!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and ca=\r\nshing it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the ba=\r\nnk and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity=\r\n as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the =\r\nmaster. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities ar=\r\ne your way to serve your \n&gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be v=\r\nery wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many bi=\r\ng checks everyday to mail others. \n&gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physic=\r\nally carry papers to the bank and \n&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is ca=\r\npable of doing anything in this \n&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings w=\r\nho execute god&#39;s agenda in this \n&gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (inclu=\r\nding Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth ever=\r\ny now and then. The \n&gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various=\r\n physical persons \n&gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other=\r\n spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try \n&gt; &gt; to help others, because t=\r\nhat is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries \n&gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the ba=\r\nnk, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others=\r\n as good work tends to promote ego \n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A =\r\nservant carrying a million dollar \n&gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is =\r\nNOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashin=\r\ng it. Both are merely \n&gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anythin=\r\ng. Both are just \n&gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his age=\r\nnda. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in this w=\r\norld and one \n&gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world a=\r\nre both \n&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior to \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the world, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; himself/h=\r\nerself superior to another servant carrying something less \n&gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one=\r\n&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nituations his previous karmas place one in.

Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; used instead=\r\n of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doi=\r\nng it in the open is \n&gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. Bu=\r\nt realize that a \n&gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to p=\r\nrotect the fire \n&gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good =\r\nif fire is \n&gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; at the bott=\r\nom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the H=\r\nomam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras m=\r\nentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while li=\r\nstening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantra=\r\ns with all the attention \n&gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; &gt; some m=\r\nundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n&gt; &gt; with fo=\r\ncus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n&gt; &gt; may do n=\r\nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; &gt; mantra. The =\r\nword mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n&gt; &gt; say a mantra =\r\nor listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; control over the mi=\r\nnd and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there =\r\nis a difference between meditation and \n&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in t=\r\nhe internal fire in meditation and it \n&gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fir=\r\ne as well in a homam. So making some \n&gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) i=\r\ns a good idea as opposed to silent \n&gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to =\r\nrepeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any O=\r\nther \n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from hav=\r\ning vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thr=\r\nead ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irr=\r\nelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; stri=\r\nctly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the \n&gt; &gt; day o=\r\nf homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; recommend is=\r\n to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the w=\r\nay, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; homam for spiritual pro=\r\ngress, I am willing to take responsibility and \n&gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Su=\r\nch a person can think of me or my guru as guru \n&gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am=\r\n willing to take on any karma incurred in the \n&gt; &gt; process until the person=\r\n crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n&gt; &gt; through homam and other spi=\r\nritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or n=\r\no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n&gt; &gt; after a while, when the person cros=\r\nses a threshhold of purity. The \n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropad=\r\nesa by guru is to speed this up \n&gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshho=\r\nld of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one desires no specific material bene=\r\nfits (and \n&gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spir=\r\nitual \n&gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering =\r\nfor \n&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day =\r\nwould be \n&gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Cha=\r\nturthi morning. \n&gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; trip.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt; tr=\r\naveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended \n&gt; &gt; up=\r\n doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). \n&gt; &gt; Befo=\r\nre the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \n&gt; &gt; monsoons=\r\n come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; seriously. We were=\r\n in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartmen=\r\nt complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is=\r\n going to rain heavily in this city after \n&gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just =\r\nsmiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfinished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining \n&gt; &gt; wi=\r\nth really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt; the r=\r\nooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small \n&gt; &gt; homa =\r\nkundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover \n&gt; &gt; on the =\r\nhoma kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and \n&gt; &gt; then packed=\r\n everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later \n&gt; &gt; that day, but=\r\n we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days \n&gt; &gt; in New Delhi.=\r\n In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered \n&gt; &gt; the north, east =\r\nand west of India. It rained in every place we went \n&gt; &gt; to, as we finished=\r\n our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimp=\r\nle@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested i=\r\nn doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \n&gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rega=\r\nrding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a ho=\r\nuse(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ?

However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me=\r\n until much later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really need=\r\ned to do homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. =\r\nI started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few =\r\nmonths, I finally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose=\r\n to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the corr=\r\nect choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam usin=\r\ng the manual now! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit)=\r\n. However, as far as my\n mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When=\r\n it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world=\r\n started with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was proba=\r\nbly for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the M=\r\nother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would&#39;ve been different=\r\n while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurrie=\r\nd more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my s=\r\nweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without ma=\r\nny pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really =\r\nbenefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have h=\r\nad more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the =\r\nsame progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepared to handle=\r\n the information\n and, of course, I added it to the preface of the manual a=\r\ns asked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good guru protects a sishya from=\r\n unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember anot=\r\nher incident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to s=\r\npend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. =\r\nThe inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. Whe=\r\nn I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I started before =\r\nsunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min =\r\nbreak at noon for bath and a small lunch and another 10 min break for anoth=\r\ner bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same place and meditating w=\r\nith Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice sta=\r\nte at the end of the day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I noticed on the next day that the previou=\r\ns day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a ve=\r\nry\n auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is=\r\n 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it b=\r\nefore, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentio=\r\nned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I knew=\r\n it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would&#39;ve dist=\r\nracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Tri=\r\nteeya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought mor=\r\ne rajas into the sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;=\r\nproud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited=\r\n the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadha=\r\nna on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement, broug=\r\nht in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a very=\r\n dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it can\n suddenl=\r\ny return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s words, I introspected an=\r\nd found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was wise not to=\r\n feed it with more delicious food!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lucky are those who have a guru w=\r\nho can succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good. Luc=\r\nky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart of t=\r\nheir problem and point it out, so that they can weed it out through further=\r\n introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nI remember one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi homam in earl=\r\ny 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced=\r\n soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshi=\r\ns and said that I very close to him and that I would do some important work=\r\n in this birth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this t=\r\no him. He immediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do\n you need one =\r\nmore identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, =\r\nthe Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the enginee=\r\nr&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take great effort to ove=\r\nrcome those identities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not suff=\r\nicient, do you really need yet another new identity to feed your ego furthe=\r\nr? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for you=\r\nr progress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How true and wis=\r\ne!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and=\r\n weak dog and get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the se=\r\nnse of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the e=\r\nnergy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed the le=\r\nan dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain ego and increase =\r\ndetachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish has a unique way of looking\n at things and some s=\r\nimple points he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my =\r\nspiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra t=\r\no me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my hear=\r\nt. He would say the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped t=\r\nhe dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru d=\r\noes. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on th=\r\ne glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Somet=\r\nimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one sh=\r\nould also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis.=\r\n There is no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single =\r\nmoment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long time. As Narayan indicat=\r\ned, one should start walking on the path and\n not worry about the progress =\r\nand the distance left. One who keeps walking without distractions will reac=\r\nh the goal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The point I want to emphasize is that the external ritua=\r\nls (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should =\r\ngo hand in hand.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyug=\r\na, along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best p=\r\nath for most. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s=\r\n spiritual Guru whom I also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we wer=\r\ne in Chennai for Shata Chandi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I =\r\nthought he was really joking!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I got back to the US, he called =\r\nme again and reminded me. It then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; occured to\n me he was really bein=\r\ng serious. So, I started searching on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the net and I found a really =\r\nflimsy document, but nevertheless I took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it up and performed it. Bu=\r\nt, I was not satisfied. Manishji then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reminded me of the book he gi=\r\nfted me, but even in that it was entirely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in Samskrit and illiterat=\r\ne that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an instruction and slok=\r\na :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; performed a longer v=\r\nersion of the homam and I particpated in it, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; never could grasp =\r\nit. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; did, but still it =\r\ndid not get through my really dense brains :). I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; felt really helple=\r\nss, but the stars were such that I never gave up,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; instead I made a =\r\nsincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intends that I pe=\r\nrform the homa, then he should kindly show me the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; way. In around tw=\r\no weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has\n decided&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to document th=\r\ne Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe my luc=\r\nk and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; grace. Well ..=\r\n. its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; baby-steps and =\r\nmaking progress everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and =\r\nthe all the divine forces for helping&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the very&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous lives.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; plenty of time. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt hap=\r\npen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; overnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, that sh=\r\nould be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, =\r\nwhether you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get or dont get\n anything.

Let me give an analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself=\r\n as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly,=\r\n all the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your wa=\r\ny to serve your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; master.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nA rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\neveryday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Yet, he may\n need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything=\r\n in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god=\r\n&#39;s agenda in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including =\r\nVishnu himself) and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth =\r\nevery now and then. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates th=\r\nrough various physical persons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; present on earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ou=\r\nrselves and try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. J=\r\nust as a servant carries &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do s=\r\nuch work for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applau=\r\nded by others as good work tends to promote ego &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and we need t=\r\no guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; check=\r\n to the\n bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; car=\r\nrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in this world an=\r\nd one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world=\r\n are both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in=\r\n this world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider o=\r\nneself superior to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are consid=\r\nered superior by the world, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as =\r\na servant who considers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another s=\r\nervant carrying something less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; valuable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrate=\r\ns\n one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no mat=\r\nter what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can=\r\n remain happy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise an=\r\nd criticism and in light &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and darkness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It i=\r\ns a job &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But y=\r\nou own nothing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer=\r\n.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nTo: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thu=\r\nrsday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Reading your response an=\r\nother question came into my mind. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You said:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it =\r\nnot good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the fact=\r\n that the fire is getting extinguished?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regu=\r\nlarly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; extingu=\r\nished while the homa is still on..happened with me couple of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ntimes... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one\n member &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me, i relight the fire and keep &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -R=\r\negards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consci=\r\nousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dat=\r\ne: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Phani,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; floo=\r\nrs) ? Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red brick=\r\ns, with sand base be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; used instead of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n copper one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a r=\r\nooftop. Doing it in the open is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; actually better than doing it=\r\n in closed space. But realize that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rain can cause problems.=\r\n Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; if it rains whil=\r\ne you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; extinguished=\r\n by rain in the middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes=\r\n, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at the=\r\n bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; should one repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras\n mentally along with=\r\n the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally wh=\r\nile listening attentively (not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even list=\r\nening to mantras with all the attention &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; focused is as powerfu=\r\nl as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X =\r\nis chanting a mantra and thinking of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some mundane matter in t=\r\nhe mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with focus and t=\r\nhinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may do n=\r\nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; man=\r\ntra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between =\r\nmeditation and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is\n submitted in the internal fi=\r\nre in meditation and it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as =\r\nwell in a homam. So making some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; external sound (even if feebl=\r\ne) is a good idea as opposed to silent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; chanting or just liste=\r\nning. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can=\r\n bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; conditions/niyam=\r\nas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeter=\r\nain food?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayana=\r\nm (sacred thread ceremony) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bach=\r\nelor or married is irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One sho=\r\nuld follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; guru. Whatever =\r\nrules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; strictly. At th=\r\ne minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; day of =\r\nhomam and take a bath before homam.\n Another rule I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reco=\r\nmmend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to=\r\n do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take respon=\r\nsibility and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of =\r\nme or my guru as guru &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take=\r\n on any karma incurred in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; process until the person crosse=\r\ns some minimum threshhold of purity &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; through homam and other s=\r\npiritual practices. Sacred thread or no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantro=\r\npadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after a while, =\r\nwhen the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; goal of u=\r\npanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nand make the person cross the threshhold of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; As long as one\n desires no specific material benefits (and &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritu=\r\nal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suff=\r\nering for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any=\r\n good date to start the Homam? or any day would be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fine?&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Cha=\r\nturthi morning. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning r=\r\nain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; trip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru=\r\n Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific pr=\r\noject). We ended &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several pla=\r\nces (wherever we were). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to c=\r\narry an umbrella with\n me. As &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July=\r\n in India, I did not take it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi =\r\nin mid-May.. We proceeded to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment com=\r\nplex we were in, to do a homam. Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, i=\r\nt is going to rain heavily in this city after &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our homam finis=\r\nhes&quot;. I just smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, i=\r\nt did rain as soon as our homas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; finished. After we offered po=\r\nornaahuti, it suddenly started raining &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with really big drops.=\r\n Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the rooftop clos=\r\ne to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homa ku=\r\nndas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\non the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a f=\r\new days &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip =\r\nas we covered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in=\r\n every place we went &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that plac=\r\ne and prepared to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regard=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rologer.=\r\norg/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; nath..org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; ---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt=\r\n;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ga=\r\nnapati Homam daily, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; regarding it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Hom=\r\nam be performed on the\n roof top of a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; floors) ?
