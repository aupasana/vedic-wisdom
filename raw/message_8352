Fantastic ren=\r\ndition.\n&gt; If Thakur ji sang/heard this, coupled with his devotion, he would=\r\n be\n&gt; lost in mahabhava samadhi in seconds.

Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo\n&gt; \n&gt; To P=\r\nriyank  Maharaj,\n&gt; \n&gt; A little pointer,\n&gt; &quot;they do sadhana for all gods&quot;\n&gt; =\r\nFor all forms sounds better, and I always prefer to do for one form\n&gt; first=\r\n, paagal kutton ki tarah till that form runs after the devotee to\n&gt; perform=\r\n worship because now he/she can&#39;t afford to be away from the\n&gt; devotee. It =\r\nbecomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; understand.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n A little point about love these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; =\r\nthe sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; ope=\r\nn field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; was =\r\nsweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; sweat c=\r\noming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; me to h=\r\nide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; The man looked down in shame upon hims=\r\nelf and asked himself,\n&gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  =\r\ngo away this very\n&gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself d=\r\nown with sweat.\n&gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, co=\r\nming out to\n&gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive h=\r\nim away, we\n&gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to=\r\n all that\n&gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; =\r\nbecause after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nshine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; (=\r\nThat last line was a joke.)\n&gt; \n&gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the=\r\n sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and s=\r\nince that orb is so\n&gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all=\r\n because of him\n&gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which lead=\r\ns to all of us\n&gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this p=\r\nlanet won&#39;t\n&gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no pla=\r\ny.\n&gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all ou=\r\nr\n&gt; births combined.\n&gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worshi=\r\np business. And\n&gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; \n&gt; These days, if a man loves a =\r\ngirl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; automatically she is a whore for =\r\nthat man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!=\r\n!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know=\r\n of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoke=\r\nn with him, rarely met\n&gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he =\r\nis lost in god to\n&gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these charac=\r\nters, I myself\n&gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form =\r\nof our mother,\n&gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her fr=\r\nom god.\n&gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule?????=\r\n My\n&gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main in=\r\nk\n&gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa=\r\n\n&gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; qu=\r\nite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he went on, that who told you tha=\r\nt you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; love????\n&gt; You love then claim that som=\r\nebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; slap!!\n&gt; You people love, to get. =\r\nI love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; is to look out for her, pr=\r\notect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; I ask, i am screwed, becaus=\r\ne I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when =\r\ndid i become big enough to know whats\n&gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka=\r\n kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; should be so intense, that god hers=\r\nelf should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather p=\r\nrefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because =\r\nif I have her, i already have that\n&gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; To top =\r\nit all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; he say a=\r\nnything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; have surren=\r\ndered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; mean you sit on=\r\n your ass warming it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; everything god w=\r\nill do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; hui hai??\n&gt; \n&gt; Surr=\r\nender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; god&#39;s,=\r\n the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; If you a=\r\nctually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; counselor=\r\n, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; in a jhug=\r\ngi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the=\r\n greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; always mainta=\r\nined be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; when he sees =\r\nhis master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; master , to bri=\r\nng him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; doggy is happy, hi=\r\ns master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; doggy is happy. Becaus=\r\ne doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Equate doggy with us , =\r\nand master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; We are never happy with what =\r\nthe master brings, because we were\n&gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala le=\r\nke aaya paneer.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, =\r\nbhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; \n&gt; We actually don&#39;t w=\r\nant the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; then we claim to ot=\r\nhers , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; If y=\r\nou only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; We are=\r\n selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; that ma=\r\nsterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; blanket, tha=\r\nt milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; wag at his tho=\r\nught. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; about the great =\r\ndogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; nope. That is ment=\r\nal masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir, if you become do=\r\ng&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; oye hoye sir, the eth=\r\nereal world will salute you. They do to Mr Rao&#39;s\n&gt; mentor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maalik, mai=\r\nn shehennshaye - e - befkuf aap jaise sant mahagyaani logon\n&gt; ke kya jawaab=\r\n doonga, mujhe kuch nahin aata, main gadha hoon aur sada\n&gt; rahoonga. It all=\r\n my teacher aka my baapji aka my god aka my mother aka\n&gt; my father aka my u=\r\nniverse, who is responsible for all that you perceive\n&gt; about me. i am usel=\r\ness, its all my mother.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has any questions, ask god. Ask sinc=\r\nerely answers will be\n&gt; provided. Ask god when you invite him/her.it in the=\r\n fire, baaten karo\n&gt; unse, woh bare kamaal ki cheez hain, bahut hi mast, un=\r\nke peeche par\n&gt; jaao, pagal kutte ki tarah jo ki pyjama phaar ke hi dum let=\r\na hain, aur\n&gt; phir dekho ki kya hota hai.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ask Mr Rao, ask Rajarshi,=\r\n ask guys who are actually doing worship, me\n&gt; toh is busy gawking at beaut=\r\niful girls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yaar type karke, aur baith baith ke, dard ho gaya hain pic=\r\nhware mein,\n&gt; aur main yeh soch raha hoon ki agar itna effort bhagwaan ke b=\r\naare mein\n&gt; sochne mein lagayaa hota, toh behtar hota. Khair koi nahin ab a=\r\nap(jo bhi\n&gt; par raha hain), jitni der ho sake, bhagwaan ke saath bitao, bah=\r\nut par\n&gt; liya.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Shree Shenshah - e - Shamshaan!!!\n&gt; Bolo hari bo=\r\nlo gopaal bolo\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. Just as I was posting this , ms jha has given m=\r\ne a nice kick in the\n&gt; face. Yay!!
