My que=\r\nstion is whether there is any role for imagination or should we shut our mi=\r\nnds to fantasies?\n\nWhen we are near the real thing maybe there is no role f=\r\nor imagination. However, when that is not the case there may be certain lon=\r\ngings that may lead to imagination.\n\nFor me, i have not been able to imagin=\r\ne a personal deity. u can call it my bad luck. But on your advise that one =\r\nshould begin with Mahaganapathi homam, i am trying to develop a relationshi=\r\np with him. \n\nThere are many attributes of Ganapathi that i am beginning to=\r\n become conscious of(i looked up the wiki). what i pray to is someone joyou=\r\ns and dancing, someone who governs intelligence (siddhi), and, of course, t=\r\nhe remover of vighna. i imagine the twists and turns of his trunk (vakra tu=\r\nnda?) to be the twists and turns within me, my own crookendness.\n\ni have a =\r\nsmall metallic idol of ganesha that i use for the homam. Lately i have star=\r\nted imagining the four arms of ganesha as the arms of the flames in the hav=\r\nana. that makes me wonder whether the arms of various deities are a depicti=\r\non of sun flares...a central energy point from where these shoot out.\n\nsome=\r\nhow i like the heat of the flames on the face and imagine that maybe some p=\r\nurification is taking place when i bend down to the fire towards the end of=\r\n the homam. The smoke of the agarbatti dances around the the kund and somet=\r\nimes enters into it, almost as if it had a live presence.\n\ntoday was one of=\r\n those rare days when i could get up early and do homam around 5 a.m.in an =\r\nopen courtyard. i imagined that the brahma muhurtam was still there. i imag=\r\nined that the fire got started very quickly and was bright and crackling in=\r\n no time. i have a habit of turning the pieces of coconut with the tongs so=\r\n that they would burn thoroughly. i imagine that they they are my past sins=\r\n/karma which should reduce to ashes. Today the akshatra, the raisens and th=\r\ne flower that i offered were taken away one by one by the ants that appeare=\r\nd from nowhere. it was amusing to see the flower and the raisens &quot;walking&quot; =\r\naway. i imagined that the ants were the ganas of ganapathi who came for the=\r\n offerings.\n\nnow u may ask with all these &quot;watchings&quot; and imaginings where =\r\nwas the mind in meditation?\n\nthe answer is obvious :)\n\ni know the imagining=\r\ns are distracting and my &quot;meditation&quot; is imperfect.\n\nbut then i have a long=\r\n way to go....:(\n\n\n"}}
