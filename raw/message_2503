In re=\r\nality, a deity existing microcosmically &quot;inside&quot; you, a deity existing micr=\r\nocosmically inside me, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else=\r\n and a deity existing &quot;externally&quot; in the macrocosm (universe) is one and t=\r\nhe same and there is absolutely no difference between all of them! That is =\r\nessentially the Upanishadic understanding.\n=A0\nIn fact, when you say &quot;insid=\r\ne me&quot;, ask yourself : &quot;what is this I&quot;? Is it the physical body? Is it the =\r\nsubtle body? Is it the causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it=\r\n is a physical body, it indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks a=\r\nt it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it ind=\r\need becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains =\r\nthe notion that it is a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal bo=\r\ndy and looks it as I. When mind finally overcomes all such notions one afte=\r\nr the other, it may look at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as=\r\n I. According to upanishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Bra=\r\nhman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside y=\r\nou&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; are just expressions that describe false notions rathe=\r\nr than reality. There is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme=\r\n cosmic being.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhen=\r\n you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion that there is a certain en=\r\ntity called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; etc, these e=\r\nntities exist within your mind, for as long as your mind=A0can keep those n=\r\notions alive. When all such false notions are successfully eliminated, only=\r\n=A0supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to focus on.\n=A0\nWhen a condit=\r\nioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific person called &quot;Rajarshi =\r\nNandy&quot; in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied with so many things =\r\nthat it cannot focus itself on god perfectly. Due to its pre-occupations, i=\r\nt can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. Thi=\r\ns is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be refle=\r\ncted on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored.=\r\n It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, =\r\neach mind can focus on god in a different way, to a different extent. We ex=\r\npress this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mind focuses on internal =\r\ngod and he is limited&quot;.\n=A0\nThis is just a simple way to put things. In rea=\r\nlity, the issue is not internal vs external. The issue is the mind&#39;s abilit=\r\ny to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupation with other thi=\r\nngs comes down and its ability to focus on god goes up, we say that the int=\r\nernal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a way of representation=\r\n. In reality, god, whether you call him internal or external, is infinite a=\r\nnd does not become weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and mind&#39;s=\r\n idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may=\r\n show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun aft=\r\ner you clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He i=\r\ns the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has become cleaner and br=\r\nighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirror! Though we may talk abou=\r\nt Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and the external Sun, t=\r\nhey are all one and\n the same!\n=A0\nThis manner of speaking about internal v=\r\ns external god and talking about strengthening internal god is used to simp=\r\nlify things. Bottomline is that any visualization of god by a mind is limit=\r\ned by the conditioning, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing =\r\nthe mind to visualize god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, =\r\nwe sharpen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other p=\r\nre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say =\r\nthat internal god has become infinite. This is just a manner of speaking.\n=\r\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nI want to give a sm=\r\nall practical example, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some conce=\r\npts.\n=A0\nOnce=A0a couple of priests with a high spiritual caliber were cond=\r\nucting a Rudraabhishekam. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person=\r\n who worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started =\r\nto meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever man=\r\ntra or deity he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering =\r\nto Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he=\r\n was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering G=\r\nayatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awaren=\r\ness was modified. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-p=\r\nervading light that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state f=\r\nor a while. When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priest=\r\ns described something unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, th=\r\nat priest turned towards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He s=\r\naw\n a tall=A018-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in=A0the place of this =\r\nperson for a little while.\n=A0\nAs that person meditated, his=A0senses turne=\r\nd inward and he was looking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshm=\r\ni, who filled his entire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his=\r\n distinction of internal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *=\r\na part* of all-pervading light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). H=\r\ne basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was a=\r\nlso a part of. However, the priest who happened to look at him at that time=\r\n was also in a purified state and so he noticed something. His mental condi=\r\ntioning at that time=A0made him see a specific=A0external form rather than =\r\nan all-pervading form. But both the priest and the person perceived the sam=\r\ne entity in two different ways. One was external and limited. The other was=\r\n neither internal nor external (but obtained by looking internally at first=\r\n) and unlimited. But, both are the same. They appeared different to two min=\r\nds because of the\n conditioning of those minds rather than anything else, j=\r\nust as the same Sun may appear different in two different mirrors!\n=A0\n*=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nNo amount of theorization w=\r\nill help one fully understand and appreciate things like this. The most imp=\r\nortant thing is to do some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a regul=\r\nar basis.. No effort is wasted and eventually gives results when there is c=\r\nritical mass. Whatever I say, whatever masters have said before and whateve=\r\nr rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood and appreciated through di=\r\nrect experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures and mails =\r\nlike this is only a starting point. One has to engage in some sadhana. Even=\r\n people like Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vive=\r\nkananda etc did sadhana for many years, before they realized god.\n=A0\nBest =\r\nregards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpan=\r\na\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish =\r\nlessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;Namaste Nara=\r\nsimha,\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;=\r\nThere is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear t=\r\nhat point. You mentioned:\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;The god in your homam fire is not an extern=\r\nal god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are proje=\r\ncting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your=\r\n ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. T=\r\nhough there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation w=\r\nith so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can=\r\n focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow i=\r\nt. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;When we a=\r\nre doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity from within=\r\n ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deities resi=\r\nde(inside) ? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing ou=\r\nt the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, univers=\r\nal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and =\r\nI am trying to invite him into the fire?\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I remember a line from Vimal=\r\nananda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body=A0so=\r\n that this deity (the one we projected)=A0may lead us to the real deity who=\r\n exists outside in the universe.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Did I understand the procedure corre=\r\nct?

A purified servant of god serves god=\r\n with single-minded focus and devotion and has no other thoughts in mind wh=\r\nen serving god. A more normal person may think various things in mind even =\r\nwhen serving god. There is some self-centeredness and ego even in serving g=\r\nod.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own in=\r\nternal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manif=\r\nestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the m=\r\nind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actually=\r\n infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other thing=\r\ns limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and p=\r\nerceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good mediu=\r\nm to project it for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you t=\r\nhat you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that what=\r\n is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you that you are abl=\r\ne to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured sl=\r\nowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. When =\r\nthis divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desires and other\n thoug=\r\nhts will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divin=\r\nity. Some precautions will help you in the journey.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Karmas and thought=\r\ns of people who are making offerings in your homam fire are basically being=\r\n received in your internal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after=\r\n all, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone=\r\n, he may just do it. But that makes him weaker and who knows whether the de=\r\nsire was worthwhile?!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire,=\r\n you yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spi=\r\nritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But,=\r\n why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thus, this i=\r\ns not a matter of political correctness and being nice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;However, there=\r\n is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connect=\r\ned to one karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may a=\r\nffect husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires alrea=\r\ndy (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no=\r\n significant drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Bottomline:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and=\r\n their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then al=\r\nlow such people to offer in your homam fire..

What this namboodi=\r\nri did is the correct way.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as your=\r\n internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your intern=\r\nal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identification is (=\r\nit will get stronger with practice).. If anyone handles that external fire =\r\nor makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to y=\r\nour internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed =\r\nfor people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or pa=\r\nrents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the entire =\r\nworld if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a person=\r\n with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and wor=\r\nk on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possib=\r\nle to take on more karmas and face their consequences.

Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings i=\r\nnto you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only =\r\nyou make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal =\r\nfire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while=\r\n, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire=\r\n will become strong and burn various vaasanas.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are d=\r\nifferent methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kar=\r\na nyaasa are usually standard.. Do not worry about these things and do what=\r\n you are used to or what you are more attracted to.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said =\r\nmany times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a let=\r\nter in a particular body part has a higher significance than just touching =\r\na body part and saying the letter. Visualizing a specific body part vibrati=\r\nng with a specific sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progre=\r\nss in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing=\r\n what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this will not block y=\r\nou.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) They should be shown in the video.

Due to its pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on =\r\nsmall aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is like a mirror capturin=\r\ng Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 =\r\nways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. It may reflect very little=\r\n sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, each mind can focus on god =\r\nin a different way, to a different extent.

Th=\r\ne issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s p=\r\nre-occupation with other things comes down and its ability to focus on god =\r\ngoes up, we say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is =\r\njust a way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him interna=\r\nl or external, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind=\r\n can focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dir=\r\nty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a =\r\ncleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really bec=\r\nome cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirro=\r\nr&quot; has become cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mir=\r\nror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2,\n Sun in mir=\r\nror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and the same!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;This manner of speaking about internal vs external god and talking =\r\nabout strengthening internal god is used to simplify things. Bottomline is =\r\nthat any visualization of god by a mind is limited by the conditioning, abi=\r\nlities and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind to visualize god, =\r\nto the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its ability to v=\r\nisualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and becomes =\r\nfully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that internal god has becom=\r\ne infinite.

They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person =\r\nwho worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started t=\r\no meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mant=\r\nra or deity he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering t=\r\no Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he =\r\nwas visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Ga=\r\nyatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awarene=\r\nss was modified. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pe=\r\nrvading light that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state fo=\r\nr a while. When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests=\r\n described something unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, tha=\r\nt priest turned towards this person\n and was surprised by what he saw. He s=\r\naw a tall&nbsp;18-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in&nbsp;the place of =\r\nthis person for a little while.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;As that person meditated, his&nbsp;senses turned inward and he was l=\r\nooking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his ent=\r\nire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of inter=\r\nnal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervad=\r\ning light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived=\r\n Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. Howeve=\r\nr, the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purifi=\r\ned state and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time&=\r\nnbsp;made him see a specific&nbsp;external form rather than an all-pervadin=\r\ng form. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two=\r\n different ways. One was external and limited. The other was neither intern=\r\nal nor external (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited=\r\n. But, both are the same. They appeared\n different to two minds because of =\r\nthe conditioning of those minds rather than anything else, just as the same=\r\n Sun may appear different in two different mirrors!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;No amount of theorization will help one fully understand a=\r\nnd appreciate things like this.

My questions is, is this where all deities r=\r\neside(inside) ? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing=\r\n out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, univ=\r\nersal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, a=\r\nnd I am trying to invite him into the fire?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I remember a line from Vimalananda where h=\r\ne says, initially we create the deity in the astral body&nbsp;so that this =\r\ndeity (the one we projected)&nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;may &lt;/EM&gt;lead us to the real deity wh=\r\no exists outside in the universe.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Did I understand the procedure correct?

Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow =\r\nhim to &quot;serve god&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving =\r\ngod *well*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus a=\r\nnd devotion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more norm=\r\nal person may think various things in mind even when serving god. There is =\r\nsome self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The god in your =\r\nhomam fire is not an external god, but your own internal god. Through your =\r\nmental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside yo=\r\nu into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want t=\r\no clarify one thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside=\r\n you, your pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the =\r\ndivinity that your\n mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on =\r\nit more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focu=\r\nsing better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and=\r\n perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limit=\r\ned manifestation of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and pe=\r\nrceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow=\r\n, rather than used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and =\r\nbecomes infinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you w=\r\nill be able to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions wil=\r\nl help you in the journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people who are mak=\r\ning offerings in your homam fire are basically being received in your inter=\r\nnal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *you=\r\nr own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. Bu=\r\nt that makes\n him weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may ha=\r\nve some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But=\r\n, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone els=\r\ne&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, this is not a matter of =\r\npolitical correctness and being nice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, there is already a lo=\r\nt of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmic=\r\nally, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s =\r\ndesires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast in a=\r\n closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significant dra=\r\nwback to allowing them to share fire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If some peo=\r\nple are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and their desir=\r\nes to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such peo=\r\nple to\n offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specifically, so=\r\nme close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly affecting your=\r\n own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Usually, that wo=\r\nuld be immediate family, but you know your situation better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best re=\r\ngards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc=\r\n85.mail..yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnarayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Sh=\r\nri Krishna Kanth,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of you=\r\nr immediate family.

What this namboodiri did is the correct way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; V=\r\nisualize the external fire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offer=\r\nings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, depending on h=\r\now strong your identification is (it will get stronger with practice). If a=\r\nnyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will=\r\n be submitted by that person to your internal fire for burning. This interm=\r\ningling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertw=\r\nined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of course, you can\n al=\r\nso take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready and willing to fac=\r\ne their consequences, but a person with a strong individualized ego should =\r\nlimit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego bec=\r\nomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas and face their =\r\nconsequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits f=\r\nrom a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, until y=\r\nou become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yourself fro=\r\nm the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow a=\r\nnyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings =\r\nin it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external=\r\n fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily,\n most peopl=\r\ne who follow this approach do not understand much about fire and do not hav=\r\ne a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an id=\r\nol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can.. Thus, al=\r\nlowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be=\r\n inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you m=\r\nake offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire =\r\n(bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a s=\r\ntrong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will=\r\n become strong and burn various vaasanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) Th=\r\nere are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaas=\r\na and kara nyaasa are usually standard.. Do not worry about these things an=\r\nd do what you are used to or what you are more attracted\n to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for mo=\r\nst people. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher signific=\r\nance than just touching a body part and saying the letter.. Visualizing a s=\r\npecific body part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after on=\r\ne makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there =\r\nis no point in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you t=\r\nhat this will not block you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) They should be =\r\nshown in the video.
