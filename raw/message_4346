The impact was supposedly to kick up a plume\nof debris rising as high as six miles (10 kilometers) above the lunar\nsurface and create a crater of a size equal to 1/3rd of a football\nfield.  Prior to October, a Japanese satellite collided with the moon.\n\nRishi&#39;s said &quot;Yatha Pindae, Thatha Brahmandae&quot;, and I was wondering\nhow does these kind of &quot;attacks&quot; impact us? If space exploration\ninvolved more of these kind of bombing (man made), does it not disturb\nthe planetary environment ? and in-turn affect us somehow ? some\nenergy imbalances ? mood change ?\n\nRegards,\nHemanth\n\n\n-----\n\n&quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long\nas one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n\n"}}
