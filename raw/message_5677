This period of history i=\r\ns very murky since it has its basis in the Sindhu Saraswati Civiization ( I=\r\n will not call it the Harappa Mohenjedaro civilization ) . The AIT proponen=\r\nts claim Brahmi owes its origins to the phoenician and Aramaic scripts of t=\r\nhe middle east and was carried by the invaders into India.\n\n(There are simi=\r\nlarities but they were carried from India to the other world as Subhash Kak=\r\n and other researchers have shown ) \n\nThe Anti AIT research shows it could =\r\nhave originated from the Sindhu Saraswati script which has not been deciphe=\r\nred fully.  I strongly beleive the AIT is a huge theory foisted upon the hi=\r\nndus to discredit the value of the vedas and modern gene tracing research d=\r\none by Stephen Oppenheimer and others who collected of millions of gene sam=\r\nples to study this actually discredits the AIT.\n\nThe beauty of Sanskrit was=\r\n it being a oral living language rather than a written language and one of =\r\nthe many reasons could be the proper intonation and pronounciation emphasis=\r\n and also this gave it the ability to survive multiple invasions!!!! A lang=\r\nuage that is not written anywhere will still stay alive even after the book=\r\ns are burnt.\n\nThe atharva veda talks about Mandalas and the Yantras emerged=\r\n only later in the Tantra period ( 5th Century B.C) by the time Brahmi had =\r\nemerged.I am not entirely sure of the above but other members can comment.\n=\r\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Giris=\r\nh Shahapurkar &lt;geniusgirish@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Jhaji/ PVR ji and oth=\r\ner Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; Lately I came to know (and I was surprised to learn) that =\r\nthe earliest script\n&gt; used for writing sanskit is Brahmi and not Devanagri!=\r\n Why would the oldest\n&gt; language in the world and so advanced at that not h=\r\nave a script? Or is this\n&gt; knowledge hidden from us till date?\n&gt; \n&gt; It is h=\r\nard to imagine that such a perfect and beautiful language so widely used\n&gt; =\r\n(and maybe for secular purposes also) would not have a script! E.g. if yant=\r\nra&#39;s\n&gt; were made what script were they written in?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it also possible=\r\n that we lost many precious treasures of knowledge over the\n&gt; years as they=\r\n were not written down? Writing down is somehow similar to burying\n&gt; a pot =\r\nof gold to be recovered later on, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if Devanagari was us=\r\ned later on to write sanskit how come it suddenly\n&gt; sprang from Brahmi? And=\r\n came to be widely used throughout India? Who would have\n&gt; spread the writi=\r\nng? Is there any record?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please pardon any foolish statements made abo=\r\nve as I am just curious.\n&gt; \n&gt; Respectfully,\n&gt; \n&gt; Girish\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
