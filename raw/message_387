There are other technicalities tha=\r\nt can be done away with, when they start to block one.\n\n* * *\n\nI recently s=\r\naw the chart of a person, who I am sure will make much progress and be in a=\r\n position to guide thousands of people spiritually. His chart strongly sugg=\r\nested that he should chant Chandipath or do Chandi homam and then progress =\r\nwill come. I told him that. He said he learnt Chandipath sometime ago but h=\r\ne does not read it regularly because he does not have the anga nyasam and k=\r\nara nyasam text. He cannot read Indian scripts and can only read English. C=\r\nhandipath is available in Roman script from Ramakrishna math, but that only=\r\n has the thirteen chapters, kavacham, argala and keelakam. It does not give=\r\n the nyasas, which are given in the Gita press version (available only in I=\r\nndian languages). The poor guy assumed he could not do it without proper ny=\r\nasas and did not attempt to do it.\n\nI told him that 13 chapters are the mai=\r\nn thing and all else is secondary. I told him to just start with 13 chapter=\r\ns.\n\n* * *\n\nLike this, many people have various ideas about &quot;the right way&quot; =\r\nto do it and do not even try things lest they should it do it &quot;a wrong way&quot;=\r\n!\n\nOf course, there *are* right ways to do poojas, japas and homas. However=\r\n, there are also right ways to do so many things. Let me give an analogy us=\r\ning eating.\n\n* * *\n\nThere are right ways to eat too. There are certain mant=\r\nras you should say before eating, while eating and after eating. There are =\r\nrules for what items should be eaten. There are rules for what order they s=\r\nhould be served in, on the plate. There are rules for how the served items =\r\nare arranged on the plate. There are rules for what order you eat them in. =\r\nThere are rules for what kind of plate can be used (silver, gloden, copper,=\r\n banana leaf etc). There are rules for what kind of clothese the person ser=\r\nving food can wear. There are rules for what kind of clothes eater can wear=\r\n. There are many many rules.\n\nSuppose you don&#39;t know some rules. Or suppose=\r\n you are unable to follow some rules and have to compromise. Or suppose you=\r\n don&#39;t know the mantras to be recited before and after eating. Will you the=\r\nn stop eating? Won&#39;t it be foolish to not eat because you cannot follow all=\r\n the rules and technicalities of eating? Won&#39;t you compromise wherever you =\r\nhave to and just eat *some* food, so that you get some strength and sustain=\r\n yourself?\n\nFriends, the *same* thing applies to spiritual sadhana. Whether=\r\n you spend 5 hours or 1 hour or half hour or ten minutes everyday on spirit=\r\nual sadhana, it should be an integral part of your life. It should be as im=\r\nportant as eating food, drinking water and breathing air. In fact, it reall=\r\ny is. Just as not eating makes you weak, not doing any sadhana also makes y=\r\nou weak. Just as eating makes you stronger, doing some sadhana also makes y=\r\nou stronger.\n\nPeople are unnecessarily afraid of spiritual sadhana. They ta=\r\nke all the rules and technicalities too seriously (unlike with other things=\r\n in life, such as eating, drinking, bathing etc) and block themselves from =\r\nprogressing.\n\nThis needs to change. People need to know that it is ok to co=\r\nmpromise on most things, but important to do *some* sadhana. Just as you wo=\r\nuld eat simple dal chaval (lentil soup with rice) or a bread and cheese san=\r\ndwich when there is no multi-course meal that satisfies the rules, you can =\r\njust sit down for 15 minutes without moving and repeat any mantra. Or just =\r\nlight a fire in a silver or copper or clay bowl with sticks, say &quot;Om bhuh s=\r\nwaha, Om bhuvah swaha, Om suvah swaha, Om bhurbhuvassuvah swaha&quot; and then r=\r\nepeat some mantra with swaha added and some ghee drops poured into fire. Su=\r\nch a simple sadhana also, when repeated daily, can be powerful. It is defin=\r\nitely better than avoiding sadhana at all, just as eating just a bread sand=\r\nwich is better than not eating at all.\n\n* * *\n\nRules and technicalities are=\r\n there to maximize the experience one gets from sadhana. They are NOT there=\r\n to block or stop one from doing sadhana altogether. That would be counter =\r\nproductive.\n\nEach rule, each technicality and each step in the standard pro=\r\ncedures has some deeper meaning and motive (which is lost on people these d=\r\nays!), but it is ok to compromise. If you can, follow *all* the rules. If y=\r\nou cannot, atleast do *something* with several rules compromised, rather th=\r\nan not doing anything at all.\n\nToo many people are suffering from intertia =\r\nwhen it comes to progressing spiritually. I see some great souls meant for =\r\nbig things also suffering from inertia at various levels. Unnecessary fear =\r\nof rules and technicalities is part of the reason for this inertia.\n\nThis n=\r\needs to be changed. Spiritually inclined people have to be empowered and bo=\r\nldened. The fear and inertia in them need to be destroyed. This is very muc=\r\nh needed for not just for the individual good of those people, but the coll=\r\nective good of world in these interesting times.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short =\r\nHomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedica=\r\nstro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage.
