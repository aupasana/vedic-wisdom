To me rope is real a=\r\nnd it was mind&#39;s mistake to realize it as a snake. Of course if there were =\r\nno snakes ever the mind would have never seen it would have never thought t=\r\nhe rope as a snake. Snake and rope are real. Its as simple as that. \n\nWhen =\r\nwatching a movie I know that actors are mouthing dialogues written by someb=\r\nody else. I don&#39;t become the movie or become a character in the movie befor=\r\ne, during or after the movie.\n\nIf doing is a figment of our minds , who is =\r\ndoing what ? Is a real mind doing real things ? Is an unreal mind doing rea=\r\nl things ?Is an unreal mind doing unreal things ? Oh wait, is mind real or =\r\nunreal ?Take your pick.\n\nWhen Lord Krishna gave Arjuna divya Drishti ,Arjun=\r\na never saw an unreal world.He continued to do his Karma without having dou=\r\nbts of real vs unreal.I don&#39;t see anywhere in BG where Krishna says univers=\r\ne is a creation of mind. \n\nIf you keep denouncing the world as unreal I&#39;m a=\r\nfraid it may lead to a state of Tamas.If you say everything you see is Maya=\r\n then is Maya real or unreal ?\n\n To me putting the teachings of Bhagavad Ge=\r\neta into practice itself is a long journey and may take many life times. If=\r\n you guys already realized that world is unreal by Advaita logic or otherwi=\r\nse tand you are indeed Brahman, more power to you.\n\nAnyways I would like to=\r\n close my posts on this topic. I have no vendetta against Advaita or Advait=\r\nins. Advaita just does not make sense to me and no where in Geeta I find Ad=\r\nvaita. \n\n\nVedic wisdom is not just Advaita. There are many schools of thoug=\r\nht that have challenged and continue to challenge Advaita. \n\nI hope my post=\r\ns help people who are beginning their spiritual journey use their rationale=\r\n to conclude as to what is real and what is not.\n\n\n\n\nJai\n\nPS: My wife&#39;s lag=\r\nna is Mithuna as well. She rarely has any interest in intellectual discussi=\r\nons.

Is Karma even unreal ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One does not &quot;do Karma&quot;. If a=\r\nnything, Karma does one. It is merely an\n&gt; extrapolation of the law of caus=\r\ne and effect which operates on everything\n&gt; within the material plane, but =\r\nreflects the Ego&#39;s tendency to grasp, own,\n&gt; and separate in order to label=\r\n it as something other.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that e=\r\nxist everywhere are experienced\n&gt; by us;\n&gt;      there is nothing here anywh=\r\nere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Okay. How does this sta=\r\ntement prove world is unreal ?\n&gt; \n&gt;     Thus scientists are veering round t=\r\no the conclusion that since every\n&gt; object is a sum of its qualities and th=\r\nese\n&gt;      qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of m=\r\natter\n&gt; and  energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a constructio=\r\nn of\n&gt;      consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Which scientist says universe is a cons=\r\ntruction of consciousness ?\n&gt; \n&gt;     Why does consciousness construct anyth=\r\ning ? Why can&#39;t it just be as it\n&gt; is ? What is the need for an unreal worl=\r\nd ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I understand your point about consciousness. I agree that it ju=\r\nst &quot;Is&quot;, and\n&gt; that the extrapolation of &quot;doing&quot; is only a figment of our m=\r\ninds and egos in\n&gt; order to try and understand it. The funny thing is, thou=\r\ngh, that only\n&gt; consciousness can understand consciousness. All we can do i=\r\ns invent\n&gt; languages and stumble around trying to square &quot;it&quot; in our organi=\r\nc brains.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, the universe really is, on a level of actuality, un=\r\nreal. It seems\n&gt; real to us because we are also characters in the same movi=\r\ne. A quick study\n&gt; of quantum psychics will swiftly show you that. There is=\r\n no such thing as\n&gt; &quot;solid&quot; material, the closest this universe gets to sol=\r\nidity (and hence\n&gt; &quot;realness&quot;) is a black hole, which is so out of place th=\r\nat it rips apart the\n&gt; fabric of space and time, so that not even light, a =\r\nmassless particle (a\n&gt; paradox if there ever was one) can escape its grasp.=\r\n Similarly, though on a\n&gt; different level of course, the Ego tries to find =\r\nand create solidity on\n&gt; earth which draws Chaos to it, which requires furt=\r\nher constructions of\n&gt; solidity (&quot;beliefs&quot;) to bolster it. The only thing t=\r\nhat allows the\n&gt; appearance of &quot;things&quot; as &quot;separate&quot; from other &quot;things&quot;, =\r\nis electromagnetic\n&gt; energy, or shakti, in her symbolic form as Maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIndia (Bharat) has come up with many scientific ideas that form the basis\n&gt;=\r\n (foundation) of Western science. *And they did it through meditation on\n&gt; =\r\nConsciousness*.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CWe owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us ho=\r\nw to count, without which no\n&gt; worthwhile scientific discovery could have b=\r\neen made.=E2=80=9D - Albert Einstein\n&gt; \n&gt; Carl Sagan:\n&gt; &quot;The tenth episode =\r\nof COSMOS is largely about cosmology - the study of the\n&gt; universe in a per=\r\nspective in which the Earth is like a grain to stand in\n&gt; vast beach or des=\r\nert - and the way we approach the subject is through Hindu\n&gt; cosmology. ...=\r\n But the main reason that we oriented this episode of COSMOS\n&gt; towards Indi=\r\na is because of that wonderful aspect of Hindu cosmology which\n&gt; first of a=\r\nll gives a time-scale for the Earth and the universe -- a\n&gt; time-scale whic=\r\nh is consonant with that of modern scientific cosmology. ...\n&gt; As far as I =\r\nknow. It is the only ancient religious tradition on the Earth\n&gt; which talks=\r\n about the right time-scale.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Few are the scientists that are brave en=\r\nough to stand up and grant Bharat\n&gt; her rightful inheritance, because they =\r\nsuffer from their own cultural\n&gt; xenophobia and religious bigotry, but that=\r\n is a whole different subject....\n&gt; \n&gt; It is possibly only an assumption th=\r\nat the universe is a construction of\n&gt; Consciousness, however, Consciousnes=\r\ns is one of the only &quot;things&quot;, if not\n&gt; the *only* thing, that can never be=\r\n &quot;this&quot;. Take away everything that is\n&gt; &quot;This&quot;, and the only thing left is =\r\n&quot;That&quot;. It&#39;s sort of how 2 hydrogen\n&gt; molecules electromagnetically bond wi=\r\nth one oxygen molecule, and &quot;Live&quot; as\n&gt; what we humans have labeled &quot;Water&quot;=\r\n. There is no such thing as &quot;water&quot;, per\n&gt; se, there are only electrons, pr=\r\notons, and neutrons -etc.- bumping around in\n&gt; a vast sea of Chaos, the sub=\r\nstratum, what we call Brahma.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, I am a Caucasian, American b=\r\ny birth, who considered himself an\n&gt; atheist for many years (I presently li=\r\nve in India and am Hindu). When I\n&gt; discovered the greatness of the Rishis,=\r\n the Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I\n&gt; realized how much *more* splendid this pl=\r\nanet could be with the Sanatana\n&gt; Dharma respected for the greatness, beaut=\r\ny, and Truth it holds and bestows\n&gt; upon us, who are also That (Consciousne=\r\nss is not divided as the Upanishad\n&gt; states &#39;take the full from the full, a=\r\nnd the full remains.&#39; I don&#39;t offhand\n&gt; recall the attribution.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n   I&#39;m just questioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; They a=\r\nre also &quot;assumptions&quot; that have been laboratory tested in the halls of\n&gt; sc=\r\nience and proven sound.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     which seem to be totally opposite of wh=\r\nat  Bhagavad Gita is saying. In\n&gt; fact what you are saying leads to nihilis=\r\nm which is what Buddhists say. If\n&gt; you agree that you believe in Buddhism =\r\nwe can move on. But if you say all\n&gt; what you are saying is in Vedas , then=\r\n I will question.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nihilism is an attitude of defeatism. It is not a=\r\nn attitude of respectful\n&gt; worship towards this great mystery that we call =\r\nthe universe, the cosmos,\n&gt; which we are a part of; and Life itself, which =\r\nanimates us and all other\n&gt; living things.\n&gt; \n&gt; I consider every &quot;thing&quot; as=\r\n &quot;alive&quot;. The main difference in us is that we\n&gt; have a brain which allows =\r\nus access to levels of Understanding not possible\n&gt; without a complex symbo=\r\nlic language. There is no difference between me, you,\n&gt; a drop of water, a =\r\nworm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance due to Maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a Mithun=\r\na Lagna (which should be obvious!) so I tend to think of\n&gt; things on an int=\r\nellectual level. However, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati (different\n&gt; facets of shak=\r\nti) makes it easy for my human mind to grasp the Dance of Life\n&gt; and Existe=\r\nnce, and I stand in awe before this great tapestry of Brahman&#39;s\n&gt; dream.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspect of the universe (t=\r\nhe\n&gt; Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and grants it an all-encompassi=\r\nng\n&gt; power over all that is. A Shivaite would say that the Destructive aspe=\r\nct\n&gt; (entropy) is actually the engine of life, and hence Shiva is the God o=\r\nf\n&gt; Gods. A Shakta would say that since Shakti is responsible for the appea=\r\nrance\n&gt; of apparent reality, then She is the God of Gods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I say only t=\r\nhat Thou Art That, there is no Other. And this draw towards one\n&gt; Form of D=\r\nivinity or another, or the Advaitin draw towards the Formless\n&gt; Divine, is =\r\nbased on, i.e. has its foundation in, one&#39;s Karma. And hence\n&gt; one&#39;s Karma =\r\n*does* drive one on, like a chariot driver. The BG contains\n&gt; many, many wo=\r\nnderful Truths.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     PS : I&#39;m not a Dvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I =\r\ndo not want to start\n&gt; another Dvaita v/s Advaita thread on this forum.Ther=\r\ne have been many such\n&gt; threads going on on the internet without any value.=\r\n  I just want more solid\n&gt; explanation if what you wrote is indeed true.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One does not have to declare oneself a dualist in order to be o=\r\nne, one\n&gt; merely divides the &quot;spiritual realm&quot; as something different and o=\r\nutside of\n&gt; the material.  There is no material, only the appearance thereo=\r\nf. There is\n&gt; only That. Anything else is just a temporary event.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai =\r\nMaa!\n&gt; \n&gt; krisnath\n&gt; \n&gt;     Jai\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, jvrsprasanth &lt;jvrsprasanth@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; The continuous =\r\nquest Who Am I?, guided by the grace of Sri Bhagavan,\n&gt; who is\n&gt;     &gt; alwa=\r\nys with us, will lead one to the heart center, the seat of\n&gt;     &gt; Consciou=\r\nsness, which is neither within nor without, all pervading and\n&gt;     &gt; etern=\r\nal. This supreme awareness is all that IS, and abiding therein is\n&gt; the\n&gt;  =\r\n   &gt; ultimate goal.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Let us now have a look at recent develo=\r\npments in scientific knowledge.\n&gt; At\n&gt;     &gt; one time the world around us w=\r\nas supposed to consist of matter, made\n&gt; of\n&gt;     &gt; molecules and atoms. Ph=\r\nysicists chased them further and broke them\n&gt; down to\n&gt;     &gt; nucleus, elec=\r\ntrons, quanta, waves, particles, and fields. Einstein\n&gt; said that\n&gt;     &gt; t=\r\nhe universe of our experience consists of matter and energy in a\n&gt;     &gt; sp=\r\nace-time-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D mc2,\n&gt; where C=\r\n is\n&gt;     &gt; a constant representing the velocity of light. Matter and energ=\r\ny\n&gt; became\n&gt;     &gt; interchangeable.\n&gt;     &gt; Max Planck, famous for his quan=\r\ntum theory, added a further dimension\n&gt; to\n&gt;     &gt; this, stating that it is=\r\n consciousness that is fundamental and that\n&gt; matter\n&gt;     &gt; is a derivativ=\r\ne of consciousness. As a corollary even space and time\n&gt; are\n&gt;     &gt; only c=\r\noncepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are veering\n&gt; round to\n&gt;   =\r\n  &gt; the conclusion that since every object is a sum of its qualities and\n&gt; =\r\nthese\n&gt;     &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe o=\r\nf matter\n&gt; and\n&gt;     &gt; energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a c=\r\nonstruction of\n&gt;     &gt; consciousness.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;=\r\nAll things that exist everywhere are experienced\n&gt; by us;\n&gt;     &gt; there is =\r\nnothing here anywhere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     =\r\n&gt; Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real. It is real as\n&gt; =\r\n    &gt; Brahman or Consciousness. The world we see and experience with our\n&gt; =\r\nsenses is\n&gt;     &gt; a product of the mind; the mind is a part of the ego, whi=\r\nch rises from\n&gt; Pure\n&gt;     &gt; Consciousness, which is the same as Reality.
