Actually, I am not sure if jus=\r\nt writing scripts for dramas containing a lot of conflicts is adharma per s=\r\ne. Mahabharata has a lot of conflict for example, but the story also teache=\r\ns dharma to us. It is possible that your dissatisfaction has more to do wit=\r\nh what you wanted to do and are unable to do, than what you are doing.\n \nIf=\r\n you have two options in front of you, it is useful to weigh them and try t=\r\no pick the best option. Right now, you are seeing only one option. So there=\r\n is nothing to think or analyze.\n \nSometimes, one has many options in front=\r\n of one, but does not see them clearly. It seems like there is only one opt=\r\nion and one keeps going. But as one becomes purer, one may see other more d=\r\nifficult options and have the courage to pick them.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nIn other words, you do what you believe is your dharma (duty or right acti=\r\non). What you believe to be your dharma may or may not be your dharma in re=\r\nality. But, as your surrender increases, as your self-centeredness decrease=\r\ns, as your sense of doership and ego decrease, you will become purer and pu=\r\nrer. As you become purer and purer, your dharma will become clearer and cle=\r\narer to you. You have to somehow lower your ego and self-centeredness and i=\r\nncrease the sense of surrender.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDo the best your ca=\r\nn, with respect to profession, family life etc and not worry about things o=\r\nut of your control. In addition, engage in some spiritual practice like hom=\r\nam or meditation on a regular basis. If you persevere, you will eventually =\r\nbreak through.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding the comment by Sri Uma Sha=\r\nnker:\n \nWe are not only here &quot;to do things&quot;, but also to do the &quot;right&quot; thi=\r\nngs. So, we should also &quot;think whether we are doing right or wrong&quot;. Howeve=\r\nr, we have to strike the right balance between thinking and acting. The bas=\r\nic problem is that the right action for a person depends on that person&#39;s k=\r\narmas and rinas. It is not always easy to know one&#39;s dharma. Arjuna was luc=\r\nky that he had Krishna to tell him what his dharma was. Others are not so f=\r\nortunate. They are torn by different directions in life.\n \nThough a part of=\r\n one&#39;s consciousness always knows one&#39;s dharma, that wise part of one&#39;s con=\r\nsciousness is usually suppressed. As one removes layers of ego from one&#39;s t=\r\nhinking, that part will shine and guide one correctly.\n \nThis is an iterati=\r\nve process that keeps getting better with sadhana.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nIf one has realized Self and surrendered to god completely, one will see al=\r\nl actions performed by all as god&#39;s actions and not be excited or saddened =\r\nby any of them. Krishna took Arjuna to such a state by imparting the knowel=\r\ndge of Self through Gitopadesa, before Arjuna killed near and dear.\n \nIf so=\r\nmebody who is not in that state engages in similar actions, one will be tor=\r\nn by varying emotions resulting from the actions. Fruits of some actions wi=\r\nll make one very happy and fruits of some actions will make one very sad. I=\r\nn other words, one will suffer from the bondage of duality. Thanks to Krish=\r\nna, Arjuna was rescued from the bondage of duality before his big actions i=\r\nn the big war.\n \nLike I said earlier, one can do whatever pleases one and d=\r\neclare &quot;god did it through me&quot;. That is too easy. Can one continue to see a=\r\nll as god&#39;s play and not be perturbed when something terrible happens to on=\r\ne later? If one cannot, one is not self-realized and &quot;god did it through me=\r\n&quot; is mere rhetoric. Instead of hiding behind rhetoric that does not help la=\r\nter when one time catches up with one, such a person should carefully choos=\r\ne one&#39;s actions so that one slowly becomes purer and gets closer to one&#39;s d=\r\nharma slowly.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: uma s=\r\nhanker \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, July 15, 200=\r\n9 5:00 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Please help me\n\n\n        Do your du=\r\nty and leave the rest to the god.

I donot know whether i have the eligibility to become your S=\r\nhishya also. Still, i respect you as my Guruji and i am blessed to have fou=\r\nnd you. I should thank my friend, utpal for this.. \n\n          I need your =\r\nhelp. Professionally i work for private company in accounts and administrat=\r\nion department since past 20 years. Besides my profession, i am script writ=\r\ner also.. To earn more money, to lead good standard of life and to pay back=\r\n my home loans, i have started writing script for Television serial as a pa=\r\nrt time job. I am doing this script writing work since past 4-5 years. Cons=\r\nidering my creative talents and good language control (not praising myself)=\r\nI am getting good assignments of writing TV serials.\n\n          All daily s=\r\noap television serials are glorifying more negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.=\r\n. enemities.. Sometimes i am feeling guilty of writing scenes which shows C=\r\nonflicts between SAAS and BAHU, Conflicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts=\r\n between BROTHER and BROTHER. I am compelled to write harsh dialogues which=\r\n hurts me sometimes.. \n\n          The formula on which TV serials are now b=\r\nased follow this: &quot;More conflicts means more drama and more drama means mor=\r\ne TRP(Television rating points)and More TRP means more benefits, more money=\r\n and popularity to the serial&quot;.\n\n          Guruji, I feel that i am doing w=\r\nrong by writing serials.. I am passing wrong messages to the society.. i fe=\r\nel guilty about it. I am not in a position to leave this as it gives me mor=\r\ne money besides it also gives me good standard of life and good recognition=\r\n also.. If i would leave this someone else would do it.. What should i do? =\r\nI am really confused. If i will leave writing this, i will find more diffic=\r\nult to survive in this world with home loan and two small school going chil=\r\ndren..I need your help\n\n          I was fortunate to discuss this with utpa=\r\nl.

Instead of hiding behind rhetoric =\r\nthat does not help later \nwhen one time catches up with one, such a person =\r\nshould carefully choose one&#39;s \nactions so that one slowly becomes purer and=\r\n gets closer to one&#39;s dharma \nslowly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Best \nr=\r\negards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------&lt;BR&gt;Do \na Short Homam Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=\r\n=3D2&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ns=\r\nize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;Sri \nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.Sr=\r\niJagannath.org&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------- \n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;P=\r\nADDING-RIGHT: 0px;

I \n          donot know =\r\nwhether i have the eligibility to become your Shishya also. \n          Stil=\r\nl, i respect you as my Guruji and i am blessed to have found you. \n        =\r\n  I should thank my friend, utpal for this.. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need your help. \n   =\r\n       Professionally i work for private company in accounts and \n         =\r\n administration department since past 20 years. Besides my profession, \n   =\r\n       i am script writer also.. To earn more money, to lead good standard =\r\nof \n          life and to pay back my home loans, i have started writing sc=\r\nript for \n          Television serial as a part time job. I am doing this s=\r\ncript writing \n          work since past 4-5 years. Considering my creative=\r\n talents and good \n          language control (not praising myself)I am get=\r\nting good assignments of \n          writing TV serials.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All daily so=\r\nap television serials are \n          glorifying more negativity, jeoulsy, c=\r\nonspiracy.. enemities.. \n          Sometimes i am feeling guilty of writing=\r\n scenes which shows Conflicts \n          between SAAS and BAHU, Conflicts b=\r\netween FATHER and SON, Conflicts \n          between BROTHER and BROTHER. I =\r\nam compelled to write harsh dialogues \n          which hurts me sometimes..=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The formula on which TV serials are \n          now based follow th=\r\nis: &quot;More conflicts means more drama and more drama \n          means more T=\r\nRP(Television rating points)and More TRP means more \n          benefits, mo=\r\nre money and popularity to the serial&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Guruji, I \n          feel th=\r\nat i am doing wrong by writing serials.. I am passing wrong \n          mess=\r\nages to the society.. i feel guilty about it. I am not in a \n          posi=\r\ntion to leave this as it gives me more money besides it also gives \n       =\r\n   me good standard of life and good recognition also.. If i would leave \n =\r\n         this someone else would do it.. What should i do? I am really \n   =\r\n       confused. If i will leave writing this, i will find more difficult t=\r\no \n          survive in this world with home loan and two small school goin=\r\ng \n          children..I need your help&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was fortunate to discuss t=\r\nhis with \n          utpal.
