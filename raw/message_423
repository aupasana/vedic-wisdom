Good\n=\r\nevening to everybody! \n\nI feel highly honoured\nto have been invited by Shri=\r\n Ajay Bhasin for sharing my views about astrology\nand related topics with r=\r\nespected personalities assembled here.=A0 As most\nof us already know, we ca=\r\nll these predictive gimmicks as =93Vedic\nastrology=94 these days.=A0 =A0 \n\n=\r\n =A0 \n\nWhen I was asked by Shri\nBhasin about the heading of my talk, I had =\r\nthought of making it as =93Vedic\nAstrology =96 the greatest fraud on the Ve=\r\ndas=94.=A0 On second\nthoughts, fearing that it would be too explosive a hea=\r\nding, I made it a sugar\ncoated bitter pill by changing it to =93Do we celeb=\r\nrate our festivals on\ncorrect days?=94. \n\n =A0 \n\nWell, actually, both\ni.e.,=\r\n the fraud known as =93Vedic astrology=94 and =93our\ncelebrating all our fe=\r\nstivals on wrong days=94 are inter-related.  \n\nLet me start with\n=93Vedic a=\r\nstrology=94=A0 -=A0 as to why I call it a fraud! \n\nThere is hardly anyone\ni=\r\nn India ,\nwho does not want to know as to when his =93sade=96sati=94 will\ns=\r\ntart or end or as to which Dasha-antardasha he is running and when that wil=\r\nl\nend etc. etc.=A0even if he does not know ABC of jyotisha.=A0 I have gone\n=\r\nthrough all those pangs myself and made a thorough study of all the\nastrolo=\r\ngical works besides a lot of astronomical books!=A0 I studied Western\nsyste=\r\nm of astrology also and had become a sort of famous astrologer, though my\np=\r\nredictions were as correct as anybody else=92s i.e. hardly 50%.=A0\nHowever,=\r\n this is a secret that no =93jyotishi=94 shares with anybody --\nthat his/he=\r\nr predictions are hardly more correct than fifty per cent, whatever\nlogic o=\r\nr Ayanamsha he/she may use!=A0 When I analyzed the reasons for such a\ndisma=\r\nl rate of success, the conclusions were startling!=A0 And I am keeping\nthos=\r\ne very conclusions before you! \n\n =A0 \n\nBefore proceeding\nfurther, I must, =\r\nhowever, say something about myself since you are well within\nyour rights t=\r\no ask me as to what =93qualifications=94 I have to\ndemolish=A0 astrology th=\r\nat is being practised over the last several\ncenturies, nay even millennia! =\r\n\n\n =A0 \n\nMy\ncredentials Though I am not laying any claims\nto being a schola=\r\nr, however, I have actually studied all the four Vedas in\noriginal =93archa=\r\nic=94 Sanskrit with their different\n=93Bhashyas=94, besides the various Bra=\r\nhmanas=A0 like Shatapatha,\nAitreya, Tatiriya etc. etc. I have studied, (in =\r\noriginal Sanskrit!) about two\nhundred all the important Upanishads as well!=\r\n I have also gone through both the\nepics viz. the Valmiki Ramayana and the =\r\nMahabharata --- in=A0 Sanskrit and\nfrom cover to cover, besides Adhyatma Ra=\r\nmayana, Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc.!\nThere is hardly any Purana whether the=\r\n Bhagavata, Shivapurana, Vishnu, Narada,\nDevi, Varaha, Matsya and Vishnudha=\r\nrmotara etc. etc. that I have not gone\nthrough in original Sanskrit. I have=\r\n also studied exhaustively all the ancient\nastronomical works like the Veda=\r\nnga Jyotisha, Panchasidhantika, Surya Sidhanta,\nArya Bhati, Sidhanta Shirom=\r\nani etc. etc. To crown it all, I was not a born\nrenegade against the establ=\r\nished traditions.=A0 On the other hand, I was\ninitially =93hypnotized=94 by=\r\n =93Vedic astrology=94 and\n=93panchangas=94 myself and there is hardly any =\r\n=93text-book=94\nof astrology either in Sanskrit or Urdu or English or Hindi=\r\n that I have not\nstudied with due reverence, as if I was studying the Vedas=\r\n!  \n\n =A0 \n\nHaving established my\ncredentials thus, I CAN DECLARE IT WITHOU=\r\nT ANY HESITATION AND WITH ALL \nTHE EMPHASIS AT MY COMMAND, =A0THAT THERE IS=\r\n ABSOLUTELY NO PREDICTIVE\nASTROLOGY IN ANY OF THE VEDAS, UPANISHADAS OR BRA=\r\nHMANAS. There are, however,\nsome references to some odd types of prediction=\r\ns in some of the Puranas and the\nepics and therefore calling it as really a=\r\n post-Vedic astrology is more\ncorrect.=A0 There is a rider there also, and =\r\nthat is that according to these\nscriptures, Makara Sankranti i.e. Pongal is=\r\n nothing but a synonym of Uttarayana\n(the shortest day of the year) i.e. Wi=\r\nnter Solstice and as everybody knows, it\ncan take place these days only on =\r\nor around December 21 every year.=A0 Thus\nthe Uttarayana-cum- Makar Sankran=\r\nti that we are celebrating now-a-days on\nJanuary 14 is absolutely wrong and=\r\n does not have any authority from any shastra\nor even modern astronomy.=A0 =\r\nSimilarly, the Vaishakhi that is being\ncelebrated on April 14 or so also is=\r\n wrong since Mesha Sankranti is nothing but\nVishuva (Vernal Equinox) or Vas=\r\nant Sampat and it cannot take place on any\n=A0day other than March 21/22, w=\r\nhen the day and night are equal. Actually\nthese Makara etc. sankrantis were=\r\n known as Tapah etc. months during the Vedic\nperiod as there are no rashis =\r\nin the Vedas but just six seasons and Madhu,\nMadhava etc. twelve months.=A0=\r\n As such, we are celebrating all our fasts,\nfairs and muhurtas on wrong day=\r\ns=A0 -- thanks to =93Vedic\nastrologers=94=A0 and their =93Vedic astrology=\r\n=94.  \n\n =A0 \n\n=A0The first and\nforemost thing I learnt from our shastras i=\r\ns that no system of predictions has\nany sanction=A0 either from the Vedas=\r\n=A0 or even Puranas least of all our\ndharmashastras etc.=A0since all our sh=\r\nastras admonish us from consulting\n=93nakshatra jeevis=94 so much so that t=\r\nhe Manusmriti calls these\nnakshatrasoochis as outcastes and not fit to sit =\r\nin any sabha of learned\npeople. \n\nThose\nwho can foresee our future do not r=\r\neveal it to us beforehand: \n\nAll the Ramayanas,\nwhether Valmiki or Adhyatma=\r\n or Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc. say that before\ndeciding about the coronati=\r\non of Bhagwan Rama, Dashratha wanted his guru\nVasishtha to confirm the suit=\r\nable muhurta for that function.=A0 It was on\nthe advice of =A0Vasishtha Mun=\r\ni that Dasharatha decided to anoint Rama as\nthe Yuvraja the very next day, =\r\nas it was =93Tishya=94 =A0i.e. Pushya\nnakshata then.=A0 From this anecdote,=\r\n it is clear that either Vasishtha Muni\ndid not know as to what was going t=\r\no happen to Dasharatha by declaring Bhagwan\nRama as a crown-prince or Vasis=\r\nhtha kept quiet deliberately since he did not\nwant to interfere in the divi=\r\nne dispensation! \n\n =A0 \n\nObviously, being the son\nof Brahmaji and a highly=\r\n exalted yogi as well as a jnyani, Vasishtha-muni could\npeep into past as w=\r\nell as future.=A0 It means that even if some exalted\nsouls can foresee as t=\r\no what is going to happen, they do not reveal our\n=93bhavishya=94 before ha=\r\nnd, unlike some of the astrologers of today,\nwho masquerade as =93Parashara=\r\ns=94 and =93Vamadevas=94 to tell\nus even our past and future janmas just by=\r\n glancing at our birth-charts, even\nif those charts are wrong! \n\n =A0 \n\nThe=\r\n Gita is said to be\nthe gist of all our shastras.=A0 When Arjuna expressed =\r\nhis doubt by saying naitadvidmah katarnno gareeyo, yadva jayema yadi va\nno =\r\njayeyuh =93I do not know what is good for me nor do I know\nwhether we will =\r\nwin or the Kauravas will win the war=94, Bhagwan Krishna\nneither asked him =\r\nto consult some soothsayer nor did He tell him to wear some\nruby!=A0 He jus=\r\nt advised Arjuna =94hato\nva prapsyasi swargam jitva va bokshyase maheem=94=\r\n=A0 i.e.\n=93You must fight.=A0 If you get killed in the war, you will go to=\r\n the\nheavens and if you win it you will be the lord of the whole world=94. =\r\n\n\nThus all it boils down\nto is the fact that those who know (including Lord=\r\n Krishna Himself!) as to what\nis going to happen and when do not divulge su=\r\nch =93secrets=94 before\nhand to us. \n\n =A0 \n\nRemedial\nmeasures are a farce:=\r\n Almost all the\njyotishis suggest one or the other remedial measure to thei=\r\nr clients, and\nmostly these are gems like diamond or ruby or sapphire etc. =\r\netc.=A0 What is\nsurprising is that we have become so obsessed with Jyotish =\r\nthat we forget the\nentire itihasa of our past! \n\n(i)=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0If\nthese=\r\n gems are that efficacious, why was then Dasharatha not suggested some\n=93r=\r\nuby=94 or =93coral=94 to ward off the evil Dasha that was\ngoing to kill him=\r\n when Rama would leave for the forests?=A0 Well, because\nour Rishis did not=\r\n believe in such gimmicks at all! \n\n(ii) Bhagwan Krishna was\nborn in a pris=\r\non=A0 ---=A0=A0 I wonder why He could not use some=A0=A0=A0\n=93sapphire=94 =\r\nto be born in a palace! \n\n=A0(iii)\nVasudeva and Devaki---the parents of Bha=\r\ngwan Krishna--- were in chains when He\nwas born! It is said that Lord Krish=\r\nna was a complete =96 16 kala sampoorna=A0 --- divine\nincarnation of Vishnu=\r\n and was thus really Omnipotent, Omnipresent and\nOmniscient!=A0 But in spit=\r\ne of His Omniscience, Omnipotence and\nOmnipresence, Lord Krishna could not =\r\nrelieve the miseries of his parents,\nVasudeva and Devaki, who had to remain=\r\n in chains till Krishna \nkilled Kansa! \n\nWhat does it demonstrate?=A0\nJust =\r\nthe fact that if the Omniscient, Omnipresent and Omnipotent Krishna could\nn=\r\not relieve the miseries of His own father or mother before the appointed ti=\r\nme,\nhow can a ruby or a sapphire---or some Mangala or Shani yagya--- remove=\r\n all our\nmiseries or fulfil all our ambitions?=A0 Obviously, we are being t=\r\naken for a\nride by such Jyotishis! \n\niv)\nThen not in the distant past, Smti=\r\n Indira Gandhi would run after astrologers\nfor knowing her future.=A0 She w=\r\nore a rare and original ekamukhi rudraksha, which only either the\nMaharaja =\r\nof Nepal had or she was wearing!=A0 It is said that some top-notch\njyotishi=\r\ns had suggested that rudraksha to her!=A0 Ironically, both the King\nof Nepa=\r\nl as well Mrs. Indira Gandhi were assassinated =93by the\npeople=94 they =93=\r\nhad trusted=94----ekamukhi rudraksha not withstanding!=A0What does it\nprove=\r\n?=A0 That we should not be hoodwinked by soothsayers! \n\nv) Then again a wel=\r\nl\nknown Tantrik of yore---highly respected by the then PM--- is out on bail=\r\n, not\nby dint of his =93Tantra-Kriya=94 but because of some legal loopholes=\r\n\nin FERA!\n\nSimilarly, Dhirendra Brahmachari, another high profile =93Tantri=\r\nk=94,\nmet with an accident in the plane he was flying himself!=A0 If he cou=\r\nld not\nsee his own death looming large how could he forewarn others! \n\n\n\nWh=\r\nat does that prove?=A0 Obviously, it warns us against relying on any\nsooths=\r\nayers, especially if they call themselves =93Vedic Jyotishis=94\nsince they =\r\nare taking us for a ride literally.=A0 \n\nKalasarpa\nDosha=A0 -- a non-existe=\r\nnt fear psychosis: These\ndays we hear a lot about Kalasarpa Dosha!=A0 It is=\r\n said to be present in any\nhoroscope if all the planets are between Rahu an=\r\nd Ketu!=A0 My God!=A0\nWhat a humbug!=A0 Rahu and Ketu are actually nodes of=\r\n the Moon!=A0 That\nmeans they are just mathematical points without any dime=\r\nnsions ---therefore\nwithout any physical existence whatsoever!=A0 So accord=\r\ning to =93Vedic\nastrologers=94 even such =93non-existent=94 phenomena can m=\r\nake our\nlives miserable for which we must do some upay!=A0\nDo you need any =\r\nother proofs for the jugglery that these cheats are indulging\nin?

It is these very jyotishis, whom we had treated as our friends,\nphi=\r\nlosophers and guides, who are responsible for our downfall as Kahsmiri\nPand=\r\nits, since they proved neither our friends, nor philosophers least of all\no=\r\nur guides!=A0 These Panchanga makers/jyotishis were the first to flee from\n=\r\nKashmir=A0 in 1990--- like the king Hari Singh at the time of Pakistani rai=\r\nd\nin 1948--- since they had already made their alternate homes in safer pla=\r\nces\nlike=A0 Jammu and Delhi .=A0=A0 Those Jyotishis just\nproved to be Shylo=\r\ncks, who were only interested in their Pound of flesh by way\nof Dakshinas f=\r\nor janmapatris and matching of horoscopes=A0 -- all cheating\nand nothing el=\r\nse! \n\n =A0 \n\nThese\nsoothsayers have such a hypnotic grip on us that initial=\r\nly even I was brain\nwashed to believe that the Vedas had nothing else to do=\r\n excepting teaching us\npredictive astrology!=A0 I was so convinced that it =\r\nappeared that even the\nprinciple of Secondary Progressions must have been e=\r\nxported from India \nto Western countries as the principle of =93A day equal=\r\ns a year=94 was\nmentioned in our Vedas!=A0 But thank God, I woke up to the =\r\nsituation and\ncould see through their tricks. \n\nThere\nare no Mesha, Vrisha =\r\n=A0etc. Rashis in the Vedas:=A0  \n\n=A0Leave alone\npredictive gimmicks, actu=\r\nally there are neither rashis like Mesha, Vrisha etc.\nnor planets like Mang=\r\nal, Shani etc. in the=A0 Vedas, Upanishads, Brahmanas\netc. Similarly, the V=\r\nedanga Jyotisha, the first indigenous astronomical work of\n14th century BCE=\r\n , just\ntells us only as to how to calculate tithi, nakshatra and\nUttarayan=\r\na-cum- Tapah-cum Magha etc. months.=A0 It does not list any Mesha\netc. rash=\r\nis nor any planets like Mangal, Budha etc.=A0 Same is the case with\nYajur J=\r\nyotisha of about 11th century BCE \nand later Atharva Jyotisha of about 5th =\r\ncentury BCE , which does not have any Rashis though it talks\nof planets.=A0=\r\n As such, it is=A0really a fraud on the Vedas being played\nby some charlata=\r\nns to call any predictive gimmicks as Vedic astrology and hail\nthemselves a=\r\ns =93Vedic Jyotishis=94. It is a crime under =93The\nConsumer Protection Act=\r\n=94 as it is a misrepresentation of facts to a\nclient and is thus a deficie=\r\nncy in service.=A0  \n\n =A0 \n\nOur\npredictions in the past also could never h=\r\nave been correct: \n\n=A0It is said that\nover the past about 2000 years, our =\r\nancestors like Varahamihira or his son\nPrithuyashas etc., could make marvel=\r\nlously correct predictions. THAT IS NOTHING\nBUT HOGWASH! Let us see how: pr=\r\nior to the advent of scientific astronomy into India ,\ni.e. about a couple =\r\nof centuries back, panchangas were based on astronomical\nworks like the Sur=\r\nya Sidhanta or Aryabhati or Sidhanta Shirmoani etc.\netc.=A0 I have prepared=\r\n a software called =93Mahesh=94.=A0 It\ncalculates, apart from the actual ti=\r\nthi, nakshatra, yoga, karna etc., the mean\nlongitudes of all the planets fr=\r\nom 10000 BCE \nto 12030 AD i.e. for more than 22,000 years as per the Surya =\r\nSidhanta,\nAryabhati or Sidhanta Shiromani etc. besides comparing them with =\r\nthe longitudes\nas per modern astronomy. Anybody can download it freely from=\r\n my discussion\nforum \n\n=A0http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/HinduCalen dar \n\n=\r\nUnfortunately for these\njyotishis, we find that the very fundamental argume=\r\nnts of these sidahntas like\nthe Surya Sidhanta, the Aryabhati, the Sidhanta=\r\n Shiromani etc. etc. are\nabsolutely wrong!=A0 .=A0  \n\nThat naturally means\n=\r\nthat any panchanga based on them would also be wrong, with the result that =\r\nany\nhoroscope prepared on the basis of those panchangas could never be corr=\r\nect.\nThus it is impossible for any astrological predictions to have been co=\r\nrrect in\nthe past!=A0 As such, it is all like the famous couplet of Ghalib =\r\n=A0=93yoon to hai=A0 hamko janat ki haqeeqat\nmaloom lekin; dil ke bahlane k=\r\no Ghalib yeh khayal achha hai=94 \n\n =A0 \n\nAstrology\ncannot be a science Pre=\r\ndictive astrology is\nsupposed to be a =93science=94!=A0 What a preposterous=\r\n statement!\nWhen the data on which predictions were based or are based thes=\r\ne days are not\ncorrect, how can the results be correct and how can we call =\r\nit a science at\nall?  \n\n =A0 \n\nStars\ndo not affect us: \n\n=A0It is said that=\r\n\nstars affect us!=A0 It appears either these astrologers have gone honkers\n=\r\nthemselves or they suppose that the whole world has really gone mad!=A0 Let=\r\n\nus see how:\n\nI am a puny human being on this small planet called earth.=A0=\r\n The sun is\nhundreds of thousands of times larger than the earth! And there=\r\n are other stars\nof our nakshatra/rashichak ra that are supposed to affect =\r\nme individually as per\nthe Dasha-Bhukti that is running in my horoscope! Ho=\r\nwever, this fantastic\nstatement has no leg to stand upon since the nearest =\r\nstar of that Rashichakra\nis Shravana! And do you know its distance from me?=\r\n It is seventeen light\nyears!=A0 And it is several times larger than our su=\r\nn!=A0 In other words,\nif that star wants i.e. Shravana wants to =93affect=\r\n=94 me individually,\nit will take it at least seventeen years to do so even=\r\n if that\n=93effect=94 travels at the speed of light!=A0 And by then, my Rah=\r\nu\nor Shani or whatever Dasha it may be must have been over! Then how can su=\r\nch a\nstar which is trillions of times larger than me send its rays in a con=\r\ncentrated\nform just to haunt me at a particular point of time!=A0 Can you i=\r\nmagine what\ntype of laughing stocks we are making of ourselves=A0 by believ=\r\ning in such\nhocus pocus!\n\nSimilarly, the next nearest star of our Rashichak=\r\nra is Swati !=A0 It is away\nby 26 light years from me  \n\nand is again sever=\r\nal\ntimes larger than our sun!! \n\nIt thus defies\nimagination as to how we ca=\r\nn call astrology a science or how it can be said\nthat the =93Stars affect u=\r\ns=94. \n\n =A0 \n\nPatri\nMelapak (Horoscope Matching) is not warranted by shast=\r\nras nor =A0astrology\nbooks: \n\n=A0Now coming to the\nfad called Patri Melapak=\r\n=A0 i.e. horoscope matching!=A0 This fad is the\nrage of the day! You will b=\r\ne surprised to know that none of our shastras,\nwhether the Manusmriti or th=\r\ne Ramayana or the Mahabharata, leave alone the\nVedas, have anything to do w=\r\nith Patri Melapak even by mistake!=A0 We do not\nfind any instances that any=\r\n Vedic Rishi was addicted to such a fad, since may\nbe then most of them wou=\r\nld still have been looking for a =93suitable\nPatri=94 for melapak! Not to s=\r\npeak of Dharma shastras, there is no mention\nof this type of a malady in an=\r\ny of the astrology books like the so called\nParashari, or Mansagari or Phal=\r\na Deepika or Jataka Parijata or any other\nwork!=A0 It appears to be a creat=\r\nion of the jyotishis of over the last\n=A0one hundred years or so. Aleberuni=\r\n, who visited India in 1030 AD and =A0recorded quite\nfaithfully all his exp=\r\neriences about Jyotisha and other things in India \nalso has not mentioned a=\r\nnything of any =93Melapak=94 in his work! \n\n=93All\n India \nCalendar Reform =\r\nCommittee=94: \n\nSumming up, as we have\njust seen, not only are we subjected=\r\n to non-existent fear psychosis like\nKalasarpa Dosha and Patri Melapak etc.=\r\n but we are compelled to celebrate all\nour festivals on worng days.=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0There are quite\na few people who agree with my point of view th=\r\nat these days we are celebrating\nPitra Amavasya on the day of Dipavali and =\r\nmarriages during Pitra-Paksha!=A0\nSimilarly, we never celebrate Makar Sankr=\r\nanti on correct days i.e. December\n21/22 but we celebrate it on January 14.=\r\n=A0 We also celebrate Vaishakhi on\nApril 14 instead of the day of Spring Eq=\r\nuinox i.e., March 21 or so.=A0 This\nhas been all because of the so called =\r\n=93Vedic astrology=94 \n\nTo put our festivals\nback on the right track, I mad=\r\ne quite a few representations to the\nHon=92ble President of India, the Prim=\r\ne Minister of India, various ministries\nbesides the Positional Astronomy Ce=\r\nntre at Calcutta , who publish our Rashtriya\nPanchanga.=A0 I also made simi=\r\nlar representations to all the reverred\nShankaracharyas of all the six peet=\r\nhas,\nbesides other saints and Mahatmas, but sorry to say, there has been ab=\r\nsolutely\nno response from any quarter! \n\nWe=A0 have now formed\nan =93All In=\r\ndia Calendar Reform Committee=94 and are enrolling members\nfor the same.=A0=\r\n Those interested can log on to http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/HinduCalen =\r\ndar\n=A0for entering into discussions regarding the same.=A0 You can also ge=\r\nt\na list of correct dates of festivals for 2006 and 2007 from that forum.

There are, however,\nsome references to some odd types=\r\n of predictions in some of the Puranas and the\nepics and therefore calling =\r\nit as really a post-Vedic astrology is more\ncorrect.&nbsp; There is a rider=\r\n there also, and that is that according to these\nscriptures, Makara Sankran=\r\nti i.e. Pongal is nothing but a synonym of Uttarayana\n(the shortest day of =\r\nthe year) i.e. Winter Solstice and as everybody knows, it\ncan take place th=\r\nese days only on or around December 21 every year.&nbsp; Thus\nthe Uttarayan=\r\na-cum- Makar Sankranti that we are celebrating now-a-days on\nJanuary 14 is =\r\nabsolutely wrong and does not have any authority from any shastra\nor even m=\r\nodern astronomy.&nbsp; Similarly, the Vaishakhi that is being\ncelebrated on=\r\n April 14 or so also is wrong since Mesha Sankranti is nothing but\nVishuva =\r\n(Vernal Equinox) or Vasant Sampat and it cannot take place on any\n&nbsp;day=\r\n other than March 21/22, when the day and night are equal. Actually\nthese M=\r\nakara etc. sankrantis were known as Tapah etc. months during the Vedic\nperi=\r\nod as there are no rashis in the Vedas but just six seasons and Madhu,\nMadh=\r\nava etc. twelve months.&nbsp; As such, we are celebrating all our fasts,\nfa=\r\nirs and muhurtas on wrong days&nbsp; -- thanks to =93Vedic\nastrologers=94&n=\r\nbsp; and their =93Vedic astrology=94. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
