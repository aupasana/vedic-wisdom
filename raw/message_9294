It means a completely divine =\r\navatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one poornavataras. They are=\r\n not necessarily &quot;equal&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nTo give a simplisitc analogy, some jewller=\r\ny may be gold mixed with some amount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pur=\r\ne gold, it does not mean it contains all the gold in the\n world. It only me=\r\nans it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the four poornavataras menti=\r\noned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not contain jivamsa. It does not me=\r\nan they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; in cosmos.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nIn fact, the very notion that any one form can be &quot;the most complete or per=\r\nfect avatara&quot; or &quot;one that personifies entire divinity of Supreme Being&quot; or=\r\n &quot;one equal to Supreme Being&quot; is unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.=\r\n30-31, which says that ANY form of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky=\r\n, while Supreme Being is like the sky containing all possible clouds.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nSupreme Being is endowed with infinite qualities. Any form contains a f=\r\ninite number of those qualities. So no form can be &quot;equal to&quot; Supreme Being=\r\n. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in that regard.\n=C2=A0\nIf one form is &quot;equal to&quot; su=\r\npreme being and others are\n not, you can conclude that that form is &quot;the be=\r\nst&quot;. If neither form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being, how can you really compar=\r\ne the different qualities of two forms?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAnyway=\r\n, this renders your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Kr=\r\nishna alone or not is irrelevant, for, in either case, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; ca=\r\nnnot mean &quot;a personification of the entirety of supreme being&quot;. Before you =\r\nwonder whether it refers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what &quot;sw=\r\nayam bhagavan&quot; actually means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verse=\r\ns that follow! If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is a &quot;=\r\nsubset&quot; of supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of &quot;swa=\r\nyam bhagavan&quot;???\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding (4), Parasara\n iden=\r\ntified 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the sourc=\r\ne of divinity in each of them. He only gave objective information and did n=\r\not give any subjective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently d=\r\nid.\n=C2=A0\nI have not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before a=\r\nnd after, I can comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be un=\r\nder some subjective context. I don&#39;t know the context of Suta&#39;s statement y=\r\nou allude to.\n=C2=A0\nThough any comparison is subjective, I will be surpris=\r\ned if someone considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the &quot;best&quot;=\r\n avataras. But, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama a=\r\nnd Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries an=\r\nd show soul and mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to=\r\n other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen a=\r\ns the best by different people. However, what Suta\n apparently said can onl=\r\ny be a subjective view under some context.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nReg=\r\narding (2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing =\r\n16 tithis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - h=\r\ne is always full and bright!\n=C2=A0\nJust like Moon, mind has many moods, ev=\r\nen a perfected one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awa=\r\nreness of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them un=\r\nder delusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/sou=\r\nl OTOH has no such variations.\n=C2=A0\nKrishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, =\r\nrun away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracle=\r\ns oneday and play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to=\r\n his personality than Rama&#39;s. Now, does that make him better or worse than =\r\nRama? Well, that is\n a *subjective* matter.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nRegarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings=\r\n such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the wor=\r\nld appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they =\r\nstand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. =\r\nSo Vishnu&#39;s avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that av=\r\nataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e=\r\n.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre und=\r\nerstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creat=\r\ning, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. Peopl=\r\ne talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any underst=\r\nanding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of\n sup=\r\nerficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in conscio=\r\nusness.\n=C2=A0\nMohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Narayan=\r\na were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incarn=\r\nation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serpe=\r\nnt Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).\n=C2=A0\nWe need to go deeper into what they a=\r\nll stand for esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of con=\r\nsciousness, to understand this more.

All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the =\r\nSupreme Being in SB.\n&gt;\n&gt;2. What is your opinion about the general stated id=\r\nea that only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?\n&gt;\n&gt;3. That the SB=\r\n mentions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka =\r\nwhere it says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpre=\r\ntation, and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, =\r\nand they were no less in their spiritual merit\n or intellectual prowess hav=\r\ne taken that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras.=\r\n The verse itself does not mention that it is with respect to the previous =\r\nverse, or with respect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which lists al=\r\nl Avataras. So it boils down to interpretation based on individual conditio=\r\nning. It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all share=\r\nd a similar conditioning which made them read that verse to mean that only =\r\nKrshna is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) \n&gt;\n&gt;4. App=\r\narently in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharan=\r\nya that Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all.

Dattatreya is a=\r\nn avatara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining a=\r\nnd destructive principles of Purusha combined together. That is why he is n=\r\not among Dasavataras. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/=\r\nfunctionality is simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or=\r\n Venkateswara.

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel fr=\r\nee to disagree :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquia=\r\nlly used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials wa=\r\ny beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence from =\r\nthe Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate Go=\r\nd=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity betwe=\r\nen terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the G=\r\nita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Va=\r\nishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, =\r\nSri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest =\r\nknown non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing n=\r\nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krsh=\r\nna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a =\r\nmeasure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana a=\r\nnd the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya Vais=\r\nhnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and decl=\r\nared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as N=\r\narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately =\r\nlinked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshn=\r\na, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatever the case mayb=\r\ne, each school had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch =\r\nfor their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, as yo=\r\nu rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;We=\r\n=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avatar appears=\r\n on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after the Avatara=\r\n, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0becau=\r\nse invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the lif=\r\ne of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0ima=\r\ngination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avata=\r\nra comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, o=\r\nf which we have very little written record, the world at large remained ent=\r\nirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In this light Krshna is the Po=\r\norna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompa=\r\nnied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of =\r\nRishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the ge=\r\nneral masses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked=\r\n at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avat=\r\nara because I find no other reason why these set of Avatara, from the whole=\r\n list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular imagination. I m=\r\nean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no less tha=\r\nn that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras. \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakra=\r\ns in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which =\r\nwas basically exploring=C2=A0cronologically all these nine chakras one afte=\r\nr the other by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;There are 9 bas=\r\nic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=C2=A0represent the essenti=\r\nal nature of each chakra. All these make me more sanguine that there must b=\r\ne Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Nint=\r\nh Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a trem=\r\nendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why =\r\nnot Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes down t=\r\no us from his followers, but it cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=\r\n=C2=A0arguable one of the sharpest and most logical of spiritual philospher=\r\ns. His intellectual and logical mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that S=\r\nhankara=C2=A0never claimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddh=\r\nartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibl=\r\ny in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is =\r\nno less than that of the=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today i=\r\ns, could not have been, had it not been for the invaluable contribution of =\r\nAdi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of =\r\nVishnu, Shankara would not have been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddh=\r\na into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip on India. Buddhism\n barely e=\r\nxists in land of its birth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;All this taken together, make me m=\r\nore and more convinced that there are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th i=\r\ns yet to come.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;A little bit abo=\r\nut Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-service. The=\r\nre are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, educativ=\r\ne and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean. Rama =\r\nknew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used his Divi=\r\nne Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat in sile=\r\nnt supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe passag=\r\ne. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, and it=\r\n was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up w=\r\neapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful warrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0ve=\r\nry well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, not letting that sense of pow=\r\ner pervert his mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind o=\r\nf self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by anyone who=\r\n feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or influence i=\r\nn\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. Not even R=\r\navana, by the end of the war at least. He was the very personification of S=\r\natwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he has learnt all his life t=\r\nhat one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what Rama did, and =\r\nnot what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemently. If one reads entire K=\r\nrshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Ma=\r\nthura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gita, one=\r\n will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=\r\n=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all through his life at every =\r\ninstance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all circumstances of life=\r\n, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes me wonder, was this a m=\r\nan or was this a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is as if th=\r\nere is a part of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and silentl=\r\ny watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single persona=\r\nl stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for him to =\r\nstart a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had zero=C2=A0personal stake in the=\r\n Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon he we=\r\nnt off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himself into the=\r\n politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse the w=\r\norld of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the Ramaya=\r\nna and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0Balarama in his next inc=\r\narnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshna. There are so many occ=\r\nassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all these king=\r\ns, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their village in Vrndavana. Krs=\r\nhna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand everything. B=\r\nut that cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect detachement=\r\n from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong accusation=\r\ns by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even counting th=\r\ne miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n worship Krshna, because I =\r\nhave not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single sadhaka or saint or ordi=\r\nnary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected detachmen=\r\nt through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or actively pe=\r\nrforming a larger dharma.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I started appreciating Swami Vivekan=\r\nada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was the last =\r\nknown saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stoplight =\r\nof fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other bitt=\r\ner enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=A0right upto the=C2=A0ve=\r\nry end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of that affected him to any gre=\r\nat degree. He faced terrific racism in the America, yet not a single speech=\r\n of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity. T=\r\nhat is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with you, N=\r\narasimha, for most of us it is better to=C2=A0try to=C2=A0mould ones life=\r\n=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selflessness that Rama showed all along=\r\n.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more importantly study=C2=A0his life =\r\nand imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possible, the quality he represented.=\r\n=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Shiva - will fix t=\r\nhe mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life, in some later =\r\nbirth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, unattached and una=\r\nffected by any dirt that the world throws up.

After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul and mind=\r\n) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras, the theory of evolu=\r\ntionary spiritual perfection does not add up because\n &quot;perfection&quot; occurred=\r\n before the last avatara, unless you break away from main scriptures and th=\r\nrow away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come yet).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Rather than &quot;evolution&quot;, it is a matter of what=\r\n the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga are=\r\n established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachment m=\r\nay develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in Self=\r\n (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is relevan=\r\nt is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachment =\r\nand takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspondin=\r\ng to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser,=\r\n being established in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. =\r\nSo the &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and\n hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became rel=\r\nevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything =\r\nthat didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural, ri=\r\ndiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mer=\r\ncury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tri=\r\ned to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that=\r\n rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousness. O=\r\nf course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different state from the collectiv=\r\ne consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant to on=\r\ne.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I worsh=\r\nip Krshna.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I am\n awestruck by Krishna and worship him, but I s=\r\nee Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday. In fact, I recomm=\r\nend the approach to others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Though I said Rama and Krishna are=\r\n almost the same, there is a difference between soul and perfected mind.

It lists 22 Avataras! It=C2=A0deals with the idea of Avat=\r\naran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It also=C2=A0lists=\r\n Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22.=\r\n It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the =\r\nterm becomes popular. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avat=\r\naras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we get the popular conce=\r\npt of Dasavatara.

Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita =\r\nwhen the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna=\r\n, but has transcended every limitation of conception. Hence, the One says, =\r\namong those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krs=\r\nhna! Etc..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras a=\r\ns well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutio=\r\nnary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps=\r\n not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list cont=\r\nains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is m=\r\ny point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any =\r\nuse. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will represent =\r\nall Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, =\r\nthen what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually de=\r\nscends on the earth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any g=\r\nraha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can on=\r\nly know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looki=\r\nng at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all.

More importa=\r\nntly, if your understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in t=\r\nhe FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, regarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, Srima=\r\ndBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, fath=\r\ner of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha =\r\nare &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras have =\r\nsome amount of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there =\r\nare in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigod=\r\ns etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 th=\r\nen proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himse=\r\nlf.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and R=\r\nama is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, =\r\ndemigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that b=\r\noth Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us ask a =\r\nvery fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord=\r\n Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB talks of =\r\nKrishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of S=\r\nupreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure =\r\nconsciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In t=\r\nhe next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt =\r\nin air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *c=\r\nontains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a spec=\r\nific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people =\r\nmay be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning.=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute bein=\r\ng) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in u=\r\ns and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a=\r\n higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from pa=\r\nramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples=\r\n given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are entirely divine, but they do no=\r\nt encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire\n divinity&quot; cannot =\r\nbe encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. Th=\r\ney take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT alt=\r\nering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. B=\r\nut I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an en=\r\nd in a void.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras a=\r\ns well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutio=\r\nnary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps=\r\n not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, as per Parasa=\r\nra, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spi=\r\nrit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n and its spirit of com=\r\nprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehensio=\r\nn is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is bey=\r\nond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an a=\r\nttempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical =\r\nmind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder B=\r\nuddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking=\r\n of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure t=\r\nhat the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect?

The =\r\nnature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehensi=\r\non, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness =\r\netc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful c=\r\nonnection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really=\r\n need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, s=\r\nome would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;i=\r\nnferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other dei=\r\nties are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superi=\r\nor\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them =\r\nto be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiat=\r\ning between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle fo=\r\nr even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant differe=\r\nnce between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning=\r\n. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached =\r\nand fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfecte=\r\nd mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect re=\r\npresented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and=\r\n Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their stories may be =\r\ndifferent.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes t=\r\nhat Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am=\r\n very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharin=\r\ng thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the lon=\r\ng run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, ever=\r\nyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, raj=\r\nasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistf=\r\nuls of Reality.

Let me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vish=\r\nnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is th=\r\ne 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this li=\r\nst, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vis=\r\nhnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and i=\r\nnnumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam B=\r\nhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or ra=\r\nther 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and significanc=\r\ne across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which were com=\r\nposed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was K=\r\nali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,on=\r\nce he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed a=\r\nfter this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. M=\r\natysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha=\r\n) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence =\r\nof these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic=\r\n, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the=\r\n dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this =\r\nearth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashur=\r\nama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the N=\r\nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to =\r\nbe separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the va=\r\nrious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness a=\r\nnd its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth=\r\n and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on\n =\r\nearth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on t=\r\nhe parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one =\r\nworships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation o=\r\nf the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata=\r\n can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars=\r\n of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-mas=\r\nsive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally=\r\n, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evoluti=\r\non, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier=\r\n, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A sa=\r\ntwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal ten=\r\ndencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a grea=\r\nter purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be ins=\r\ntances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will =\r\nchange only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Ra=\r\nma did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a =\r\nmoments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Ags=\r\natha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of t=\r\nhe final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he k=\r\nilled Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n was the Dharma to do so, and to unh=\r\nold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, f=\r\namily honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the gen=\r\nius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe,=\r\n as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhe=\r\nre, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into hi=\r\ns killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that =\r\nno personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadhar=\r\nma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had t=\r\nhis immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 super=\r\nnatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from=\r\n situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances that mark hi=\r\ns life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. Al=\r\nl his friends, his foster parents,\n his village-folks who so loved him, ple=\r\naded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, lov=\r\ne and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown d=\r\nestiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understoo=\r\nd that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back once his work=\r\n in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis c=\r\name to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the mo=\r\nment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he remo=\r\nved himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equa=\r\nlly and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshn=\r\na, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and countin=\r\ng. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s hea=\r\nd and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna=\r\n of being a revolutionist\n and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Dur=\r\nyodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to a=\r\nrrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet h=\r\ne did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his=\r\n own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of h=\r\nis going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or la=\r\nck of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think o=\r\nf him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect =\r\nequipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his=\r\n life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by defini=\r\ntion can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the re=\r\nsults belong to the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and=\r\n killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, o=\r\nr gesturing Bheema\n to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi=\r\n to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how t=\r\nhe situations must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these p=\r\neople. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But hap=\r\npens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Forc=\r\ne. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at =\r\nleast in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or=\r\n such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In =\r\nthe Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he ki=\r\nlls Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 he=\r\naded demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the =\r\nMahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment=\r\n of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of sa=\r\ntwa, chief\n of which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness cau=\r\nsed due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was de=\r\nstroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can als=\r\no cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He ha=\r\nd no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, frien=\r\nd, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotio=\r\nn. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha =\r\nwas great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the sc=\r\nheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a s=\r\ntatic realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality=\r\n of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna esp=\r\noused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this world and life =\r\nis the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of\n evolu=\r\ntionary development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Bu=\r\nddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less=\r\n impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line t=\r\nhat these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As =\r\nsuch many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to=\r\n be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both stat=\r\nic and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the =\r\nTantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body=\r\n of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The ori=\r\nginal literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are cen=\r\nters of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, =\r\nor non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of=\r\n the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full\n power and forc=\r\ne of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can mod=\r\nify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself =\r\nis various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point an=\r\nd not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evo=\r\nlution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8.=\r\n I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I=\r\n know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagr=\r\nee with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understan=\r\nding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among=\r\n the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda see=\r\nms to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is on=\r\nly one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunat=\r\nita awastha comes living in the full and complete\n purity and might and for=\r\nce and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avat=\r\nara will burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of=\r\n evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life =\r\nto achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The whi=\r\nte horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enou=\r\ngh to rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, =\r\nthis is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agre=\r\ne with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is clos=\r\ner to truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApanna=\r\nm manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned f=\r\nriend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up =\r\nto this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear =\r\nprogression of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other u=\r\npto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that D=\r\nasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a per=\r\nfected form. =C2=A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For=\r\n example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.=\r\n =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn,=\r\n Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive,=\r\n learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, p=\r\natience/discipline,\n spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment =\r\n(respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of th=\r\nat aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how t=\r\nhat aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how=\r\n soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind ope=\r\nrates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discriminat=\r\nion operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/d=\r\nrive/initiative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, let us rememb=\r\ner one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit i=\r\nn us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these =\r\nare different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests=\r\n as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays different=\r\n roles. There is no comparison between them. =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one asp=\r\nect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But=\r\n, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these differen=\r\nt aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working to=\r\ngether in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 One who is fascinated b=\r\ny the qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul opera=\r\ntes; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that=\r\n demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities=\r\n of wisdom may like the story that demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so=\r\n on. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind.=\r\n Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attri=\r\nbutes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes=\r\n. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existence with some\n agendas/desires,=\r\n soul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy an=\r\nd sees it as its dharma.
