When Saturn passes through Janma Rasi of Kanya, those born i=\r\nn stars of Uttara-Phalguni =E2=80=93 Hastham =E2=80=93 Chittirai may live f=\r\nrequently separated from family. They could wonder in foreign lands. They c=\r\nould feel lonely. They could feel undecided in plans in domestic front.  Th=\r\ney may pick up quarrels in least provocation. Some could suffer with physic=\r\nal troubles, or ailments. Some could run pillar to post without any aim. So=\r\nme could be troubled by unwanted problems =E2=80=93 being (second) move of =\r\ntwo and half years in =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 in the house wh=\r\nere the Moon is deposited in the Natal =E2=80=99s Birth Chart. Transit in t=\r\nhis house is the secvond part of three parts of Sade Sati. \n\t2. For many it=\r\n will be bereft of good appearance, happiness, pride and short of adequate =\r\nearning to meet basic demands in life, when Saturn passes through 2nd  Hous=\r\ne  from Simha =E2=80=93  in Stars Makam, Poorvapalguni, Uttara Phalguni the=\r\n last part in three  parts of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99. Some has to meet=\r\n excess expenditure, and could easily become tired in work place. For one c=\r\nause to another, some could be persistently in grief, and have commercial l=\r\nosses. One should avoid in total, gambling any form, share market stakes, t=\r\no avoid financial loss as well as avoidable humiliation. Certainly they sho=\r\nuld avoid bad company, association, illegal connections with opposite sex, =\r\nsome could harm educational progress, realize virility falling down, get ac=\r\nross to avoid the temptation of earning through illegal means. Many will be=\r\n forced borrow amounts beyond means to repay them, due to domestic unexpect=\r\ned needs. \n\t3. Those born with Moon in Cancer =E2=80=93 Kataka =E2=80=93 Ra=\r\nsi - in Stars Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha will have the most profitable, pr=\r\nogressive, and satisfactory period of next Two and half years, with plenty =\r\nand prosperity.  They will be free from any type of ailments. They will suc=\r\nceed in heroic efforts.  Fortunes shines on this native, They will have man=\r\ny travel to gain. Their spouse will be happy in all expectations from the p=\r\nartner through this period of next two and half years. This period will shi=\r\nne to bring prosperity and popularity to all politicians in public life wit=\r\nh birth Stars of Pumarpoosam, Pusam and Ayilyam. The bed time desires will =\r\nbe fully satisfactory. Auspicious events, hither to delayed, will culminate=\r\n to the satisfaction of all. Friends will help the native and siblings will=\r\n progress. \n\t4. The mood and act of native having Moon in Gemini =E2=80=93 =\r\nMithuna =E2=80=93 in Janma Kundali, in Stars Mrigasheera, Arudhra, and Puna=\r\nrvasu will be far from social norms, and he becomes vindictive in reactions=\r\n, when Saturn transits in 4th house.  That person will be separated from fr=\r\niends.  Some may lose properties and quarrel with spouse leading to irrepar=\r\nable results.  One could lose a dear and near relative. Body ailments based=\r\n on colic with flatulence, along with mental distress and fear could troubl=\r\ne many. (This is called Ardhashtama Sani or Kantaka Sani)  For some, in the=\r\nir Birth Chart findings, if life span is near its end, this period could ca=\r\nuse extreme anxiety resulting in death of that person. A few, may not find =\r\na comfortable shelter.  Some could develop fear that about something or oth=\r\ner. \n\t5. Those born with Moon in Taurus =E2=80=93 in Stars Karthika, Rohini=\r\n, and Mirgasheera, Saturn, during this period, will be moving in 5th house =\r\nfrom the position of Moon in the Birth Chart. One should be careful to avoi=\r\nd any confrontation with his children.  Expenses on them will increase, mor=\r\ne than normal. Problems due to their wrong involvements could cause anxiety=\r\n, waste of money, and related confrontations. Some could fail in their unde=\r\nrtakings, and incur money loss. One could invite troubles due to union with=\r\n mean partner in sex. One could be forced to move away from family without =\r\nrepute. Accumulated assets may dwindle during this period, in undesired inv=\r\nolvement. \n\t6. Moon should be in Aeries =E2=80=93 Mesha =E2=80=93 in his bi=\r\nrth Stars Aswani, Bharani and Karthikai ,to know that in this period Saturn=\r\n is moving in 6th house to the place of Moon in birth chart.  One will over=\r\ncome suddenly all his enemies =E2=80=93 a last ball =E2=80=98sixer=E2=80=99=\r\n to win a cricket match! The spouse, must be floating in joy and comfort an=\r\nd be proud of the partner. Lady can get a long waited pregnancy and become =\r\nproud of her child. Financial status increase unexpectedly. The person will=\r\n find that appreciation never could ever come from a known person, will pou=\r\nr in abundance from that person to create a flood of growth in popularity. =\r\nAll sickness will disappear and health will be blooming. All desired luxuri=\r\nes and comforts will be there for asking! \n\t7. Saturn, going into the 7th h=\r\nouse for next two and half years, to the position of Moon, - Pieces =E2=80=\r\n=93 Meena - for those born in Stars Poorvapathrapada (poorattathi) , Uthara=\r\npathrapada (Uttirattathi) , Revathi in the birth chart will cause healthy s=\r\neparation from family frequently, while putting all efforts and hard work w=\r\nith dedication in work to invite appreciation and reward from all. Some cou=\r\nld have minor ailments during this period. However, one has to be careful i=\r\nn expenses. Those traveling in speedy vehicles could either commit an accid=\r\nent or involve themselves to put them away on bed for some time. Absolute c=\r\nareful driving is recommended. One should not invite perennial problems due=\r\n to illicit relations with opposite sex, which could damage the reputation =\r\nof the person. Here Saturn could give malefic effects more that what is det=\r\nailed above when he passed through the fourth house to the position of Moon=\r\n in the birth chart. \n\t8. One would be dragged to extreme and damaging temp=\r\ntations during this period for those having Moon in Aquarius =E2=80=93 Kumb=\r\nha =E2=80=93 Born in the stars of Dhanishta (Avittam), Sathabhisha (Sathaya=\r\nm),Poorvabh adrapada (Poorattathi) , he will be away from family often.  (T=\r\nhis position  of transit is termed as =E2=80=98Ashtama Sani=E2=80=99).   On=\r\ne has to be careful with the company in which he associates to avoid bad re=\r\npercussions and heavy loss of earnings. Consequently, the good friends and =\r\nrelatives will be put to trouble.  Decrease in wealth, troubles due to ill =\r\nhealth, obstacles to various undertakings could cause mental depression dur=\r\ning this period. There could be eye trouble.  Acute shortage of money would=\r\n be felt by many. Some sort of mental agony will always persist.  Certainly=\r\n please avoid any bad physical relationship during this period in emotional=\r\n involvement with one, which could bring in perennial problem all life. \n\t9=\r\n. Having transit of Saturn in the 9th house from the position of Moon in Ca=\r\npricorn =E2=80=93 Makara =E2=80=93  born in Starsof Utthirashada (Uthiradam=\r\n), Sravana (Thiruvonam), Dhanishta (Avittam) in the birth chart, one has to=\r\n watch out for enemies to harm him in least excuse. One has to work very ha=\r\nrd which normally he could finish it easily and early. Lose of finance is i=\r\nmminent, unless this condition is offset by other Planets, positioned or in=\r\n transit, in birth chart, which are in favor.  Distress concerning spouse a=\r\nnd progeny will also exist. Money will be spent in unwanted and useless pur=\r\nposes. Keep away from any unknown opposite sex.  If the judged life span co=\r\nincides with Maraka Desa, at this time, many related disappointments could =\r\nbecome confronted by the Jathaka.  The sources of income will be obstructed=\r\n. Saturn transiting in 9th house is generally not safe and satisfactory a p=\r\neriod. \n\t10. When Moon is positioned in Sagittarius =E2=80=93 Dhanush =E2=\r\n=80=93 Moolam, Poorvashada (Puradam), Uthrashada, (Uttirsadfum) and Saturn =\r\nis transiting in the 10th house (Kanya), it could bring in sudden expenses =\r\nand fall in reputation.  One could cause distress, loss of work, meet obstr=\r\nuctions and objections to decisions, to cause bewilderment.  Many could not=\r\n satisfactorily complete the education.  One could have meager income for h=\r\nard work.  Avoid agitations, violent involvement for public cause and enter=\r\n to peace with fighting groups, which could result in never ending litigati=\r\nons and sufferings. One could lose respect and gain humiliation. It is firm=\r\nly said that the native will undergo ordeals when Saturn is in 10th from Ja=\r\nnma Rasi. \n\t11. The Moon in Scorpio =3D Vruchika =E2=80=93 Rasi in the star=\r\ns of Visakam, Anuradha (Anusham), Jyesta (Kettai), Saturn is in the 11th ho=\r\nuse to the position of Moon in Birth chart. One gets pleasure, money, and c=\r\nomfort from spouse. One will find success in all endeavors in which involve=\r\nd. The person will get elevated status and gain appreciation.  Excellent he=\r\nalth, many financial gains, increase in happiness related to spouse and chi=\r\nldren and have people with pure heart and deed around the person all time. =\r\nIf wife is pregnant during this period a female child will be born to him (=\r\nsubject to, of course, result of many other factors in the birth chart to b=\r\ne considered, in both partners=E2=80=99 chart, before such a pronouncement =\r\nis made!). One could get extra-ordinary elevations in his place of work.  S=\r\nome could get money belonging to others! These two and half years will be v=\r\nery good. \n\t12. When Saturn is positioned in the 12th house from Moon, in S=\r\ntars of Chittirai (Chitta), Swathi, Visakam, it is easily said that just th=\r\ne opposite will result to all that is said, under item 11 above. Do not pos=\r\nsess or hold any money belonging to others! One will be plunged in series o=\r\nf miseries, as that will be the first leg of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99, -=\r\n Chittirai, Swati, Visakam Stars.  All endeavors fail. Intelligence and ski=\r\nll get diminished.  His reputation is affected. The person=E2=80=99s life s=\r\npan judged in the birth chart to the Desha period in effect during this per=\r\niod, could cause health hazards and death, if it is Maraka Lord Desha perio=\r\nd.  Intensified malefic period will be in exercise during this period of tw=\r\no and half years.\n \n \nPlease Note:  The details given above are general and=\r\n millions would have born in each category.  Therefore, a complete study of=\r\n individual charts is absolutely necessary before these comments are taken =\r\nas effective.  Many changes due to relations of Other Planets, by its posit=\r\nion, occupation and qualities with the movement of Saturn and its position =\r\nhas to be studied in depth before individual results are set to be pronounc=\r\ned.\n \nPathi.\nA.V.Pathi,  \nAstrologer, &#39;Oxton House&#39;, 6, Hawthorn Road,Cherr=\r\ny Willingham,\nLincoln LN3 4JT, United Kingdom .   \nstart: 0000-00-00\nend: 0=\r\n000-00-00 \n   \n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-945739129-1251723941=:10009\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12p=\r\nt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; fo=\r\nnt-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); =\r\nmargin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,ne=\r\nw york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;----=\r\n- Forwarded Message ----&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thatha_Patty@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, August 31, 2009 9:02:35 =\r\nAM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [Thatha=\r\n_Patty] Saturn transit&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helve=\r\ntica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;=\r\n&gt;Dear\n PathiSir,&lt;br&gt;Thanks foradding&nbsp; the footnote&quot;Pl.
