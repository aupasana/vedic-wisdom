Because of curiosity I read Shri Narayan kavach=\r\nam today. I was amazed to read that In the verses we request Narayana&#39;s inc=\r\narnations to protect us from enemies. And these enemies include both our ex=\r\nternal enemies and our internal enemies like anger, ignorance, laziness, lu=\r\nst etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir I am curious that can this kavacham be used by a sadhaka s=\r\neeking spiritual upliftment for overcoming his internal enemies?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ca=\r\nn it be used to accelerate one&#39;s travel on spiritual path? \n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; Atul\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Fire in homam is a symbol of Sun on ea=\r\nrth. External Sun shining brightly and destroying external darkness is akin=\r\n to the inner light shining brightly and destroying inner darkness. Burning=\r\n homam fire is meant for stimulating and making the inner light shine brigh=\r\nter. So, normally, homam is performed during the daytime. When Sun is just =\r\nrising and destroying darkness is a great time for homam.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Externa=\r\nl rituals are meant to cause internal modification through resonance. Rules=\r\n and conventions followed in rituals are meant for maximizing the internal =\r\nresult of a ritual. They are not meant for scaring one away from the ritual=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Doing homam in the evening or night is not a &quot;wrong deed&quot; at al=\r\nl. Unlike some deities who may manifest in different forms during morning o=\r\nr afternoon or evening, Krishna is Krishna always. He can be worshipped any=\r\ntime. In fact, he was born around midnight!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; My 2 cents is that yo=\r\nu should feel free to do Krishna homam in the evening, after your work. If =\r\nyou like Krishna, go for Krishna homam.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textb=\r\nook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n&gt; &gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;        Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;        Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;     Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

Some times I have to attend emergencies in early morning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I used to perform Homam during winters regularly in early morning. but =\r\nafter summers started we usually get high incidence of Emergencies in early=\r\n morning due to harvesting season, then paddy sowing season and now a days =\r\nit is time to pour insecticides and pesticides in fields.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Due =\r\nto all these reasons I had to quit my routine of doing homam in early morni=\r\nng. And sometimes it also cause disturbance in my Japam schedule. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I seriously want to resume my routine of Homam. And as Shri Krishna Ho=\r\nmam is done in morning I am hesitant to do it in evening with a fear of doi=\r\nng a wrong deed. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  In winters I will be able to do the homam in early=\r\n morning as Emergency turnout it very less at that time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But =\r\nTill then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your book &quot;Ved=\r\nic Wisdom&quot; Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I switch to G=\r\nanapati homam to be performed at night?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I want to =\r\nstick to Shri Krishna homam as I feel myself attached to Him. But Doing Mah=\r\na Ganapati Homam will also have same importance for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope t=\r\no find a suitable answer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
