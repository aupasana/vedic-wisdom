It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I=\r\n am familiar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, in=\r\ncluding &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; , where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, des=\r\ntruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This =\r\nUpanishadic understanding is also consistent with chakra based understandin=\r\ng of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaar=\r\na chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves=\r\n Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of =\r\nearth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Sw=\r\naadhishthaana, water element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of =\r\nwater element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBy earth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical wat=\r\ner etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows=\r\n a flexible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;ow=\r\nns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is=\r\n of solid state and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a parti=\r\ncular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nat=\r\nure of water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapp=\r\ned to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps t=\r\nhinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart =\r\nfrom the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain q=\r\nualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has=\r\n about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that =\r\nself-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* t=\r\nhat is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is stil=\r\nl remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* t=\r\nhat is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one=\r\n is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk about =\r\nexperiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking merely about s=\r\nome amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice ex=\r\nperience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kun=\r\ndalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one =\r\nwill not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up =\r\neach chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is=\r\n, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existence! To completely e=\r\nfface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a =\r\nshort duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which=\r\n elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, =\r\nfire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return=\r\n to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describ=\r\ne/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the external s=\r\nenses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external sense=\r\ns playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and g=\r\net a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversa=\r\ntion between them. In another example, a yogi may be meditating with a mant=\r\nra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. Thes=\r\ne things cannot be perceived by the external senses and hence cannot be stu=\r\ndied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as =\r\nsomething that can be perceived by the external senses, because different p=\r\neople can experience the same reality using their senses individually and v=\r\nerify the observation. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be=\r\n perceived by senses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-alte=\r\nring and sometimes liberating influence on people. Inability to study and m=\r\nodel them is a big drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imagination=\r\ns or hallucinations, because there is no independent validation, and call t=\r\nhem unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For exam=\r\nple, see the following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical ex=\r\nperiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/=\r\n group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one pe=\r\nrson had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and anoth=\r\ner person seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating=\r\n to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the=\r\n first person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person=\r\n had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another p=\r\nerson seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details rel=\r\nating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience o=\r\nf the first person, though it was beyond the external senses of either pers=\r\non!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the ab=\r\nove message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity a=\r\nnd another person perceived with his external senses a vision involving the=\r\n same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything with the=\r\nir external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experi=\r\nence of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *=\r\nsome* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external sens=\r\nes are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Th=\r\nen, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot b=\r\ne measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality=\r\n&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied and measured is the=\r\n reality involving the gross body and its senses, one may suggest that expe=\r\nriences of the subtle body may be studied by observing various parts of the=\r\n gross physical body. For example, one can look at the nervous signals flow=\r\ning through various parts of the brain and try to correlate them with the e=\r\nxperiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like =\r\na great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redundan=\r\nt. Though there is some correspondence between what happens in the causal, =\r\nsubtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one =\r\nmapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be red=\r\nundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled using just the gross body!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses fr=\r\nom the road, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular hou=\r\nse with a lot of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be havin=\r\ng a party. People in one particular house with no lights are probably out o=\r\nf town. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many p=\r\neople are inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the=\r\n house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous sign=\r\nals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic thing=\r\ns, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach a=\r\nnd study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part=\r\n of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scient=\r\nists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhile rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is th=\r\ne microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time point,=\r\n even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. Wh=\r\nen Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of=\r\n the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes =\r\nand exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed =\r\nto have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pit=\r\nri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;raj=\r\narshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff fro=\r\nm the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highes=\r\nt order) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention in details about th=\r\ne process of creation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at the beg=\r\ninning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; =\r\nof Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some univ=\r\nersal energies which are more commonly known as the universal deities like =\r\nShiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are t=\r\nhe actual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence of the eleme=\r\nnt, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction wi=\r\nth the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, A=\r\ngni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and each one res=\r\nulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possibl=\r\ne states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at leas=\r\nt for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation b=\r\netween that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but =\r\nI get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice idea and I would li=\r\nke to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am =\r\nno physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of=\r\n the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half formed. There being mult=\r\niple theories of the String variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the=\r\n M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; =\r\nin parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a correlation between =\r\nthis and the idea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still far =\r\nfetched. I can understand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics,=\r\n (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas=\r\n of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like t=\r\no know more about how exactly you can link these two, because I myself with=\r\n my limited understand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now,=\r\n specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritica=\r\nl physics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of rea=\r\nlity? These two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge r=\r\neality.

It seems =\r\nto be his extrapolation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What you quot=\r\ned from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar wit=\r\nh. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Va=\r\nasishtham&quot; , where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and lib=\r\neration to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understanding is also consisten=\r\nt with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras downwards fro=\r\nm Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water =\r\nand earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is\n=\r\n surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-aw=\r\nareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within one is=\r\n surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-aw=\r\nareness. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water=\r\n etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth elem=\r\nent shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fl=\r\nuid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular t=\r\nhing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state an=\r\nd made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. =\r\na car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water eleme=\r\nnt. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five ele=\r\nments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one per=\r\nhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way\n physically.=\r\n Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has ce=\r\nrtain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts =\r\none has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represent=\r\ns that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anyt=\r\nhing* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is =\r\nis still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anyt=\r\nhing* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of =\r\nwho one is is still remaining. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras a=\r\nre often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakra=\r\ns (which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundali=\r\nni actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will =\r\nnot perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of\n owning anything. S=\r\nimilarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one=\r\n&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle lev=\r\nel of existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s n=\r\notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effac=\r\ned as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether=\r\n. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the rev=\r\nerse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and =\r\nspiritual realities:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics=\r\n describe reality?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to de=\r\nscribe/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the exter=\r\nnal senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot;\n things without the external=\r\n senses playing a role.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple ex=\r\nample, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; som=\r\ne people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another example, a yogi=\r\n may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes a=\r\nnd/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived by the external =\r\nsenses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can be=\r\n perceived by the external senses, because different people can experience =\r\nthe same reality using their senses individually and verify the observation=\r\n. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses =\r\nare sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes li=\r\nberating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big dr=\r\nawback of modern science.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogi=\r\nc experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no indepe=\r\nndent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases th=\r\nat make one wonder.

Then, one cannot rule out the possibi=\r\nlity of *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the exte=\r\nrnal senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied and me=\r\nasured is the reality\n involving the gross body and its senses, one may sug=\r\ngest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing variou=\r\ns parts of the gross physical body. For example, one can look at the nervou=\r\ns signals flowing through various parts of the brain and try to correlate t=\r\nhem with the experiences of the subtle body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that su=\r\nbtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondenc=\r\ne between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many=\r\n-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of=\r\n causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can =\r\nbe moderled using just the gross body!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses from the road, =\r\nyou can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house with a lot=\r\n of lights and\n sound and many cars parked outside may be having a party. P=\r\neople in one particular house with no lights are probably out of town. But =\r\nyou can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many people are in=\r\nside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from =\r\noutside.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the =\r\nnervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some=\r\n basic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond =\r\nyour reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domai=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality=\r\n which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yog=\r\nis and develop mastery of the internal world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (wh=\r\nich is\n the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-t=\r\nime point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state comp=\r\nletely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience so=\r\nme part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kunda=\r\nlini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rish=\r\nis seemed to have a perfect control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagann=\r\nath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarsh=\r\ni14@ &gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off i=\r\nncomplete. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff\n fro=\r\nm the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highes=\r\nt order) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention in details about th=\r\ne process of creation as he saw it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then =\r\nfrom there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with th=\r\ne chaos, it produced some universal energies which are more commonly known =\r\nas the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot;=\r\n of vayu ( none of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, but=\r\n more the essence of the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; =\r\ntaranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy sta=\r\ntes. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from=\r\n the previous and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the en=\r\nd resulted in 33 crore possible states of energy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and=\r\n I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation between that an=\r\nd the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of=\r\n myself..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice ide=\r\na and I would like to know more about it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I ha=\r\nve the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands =\r\nnow, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theories of the String v=\r\nariety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one=\r\n) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the =\r\nphysical world. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five=\r\n elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand som=\r\ne correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least\n the Copenhegan In=\r\nterpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a =\r\nlink between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like=\r\n to know more about how exactly you can link these two, because I myself wi=\r\nth my limited understand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of no=\r\nw, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about i=\r\ns the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality? O=\r\nr does it provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathematics =\r\nprovides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as reality i=\r\ns. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quote=\r\nd that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it =\r\nreally is!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; The idea of the =\r\npach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everything. The day ph=\r\nysics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing more left to do. Physic=\r\ns is still quite far away from that stage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedi=\r\ncastrostudent@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D=\r\near Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I =\r\nget the thrust of your point.
