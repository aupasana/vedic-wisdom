These four Kumaras were the mental sons of Bra=\r\nhma, the creator. Brahma created these four Kumaras through his mind and as=\r\nked them to help him in the work of creation. The Kumaras refused to fulfil=\r\n his request. They were nivritti-niratas, possessed of absolute renunciatio=\r\nn. In spite of Brahma=E2=80=99s anger, they took to the life of nivritti an=\r\nd meditation on Brahman. Brahma in his rage wanted to burn down these Kumar=\r\nas. But the powerful Kumaras who ever lived in the Supreme Soul, unconnecte=\r\nd with pravritti, could not be harmed by Brahma. Brahma=E2=80=99s rage burs=\r\nt open through his forehead and from there emerged the ferocious Rudra.Such=\r\n is the power of renunciation and life in the Absolute. \n\n\n"}}
