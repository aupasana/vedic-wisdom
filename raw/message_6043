He got it from some source and started giving Ahutis =\r\nwith the Mantra during his Maha-Ganapati Homam. As he has written, First da=\r\ny he had troubles in office and 2nd day his bike was stolen resulting in hi=\r\ns shaken confidence due to obvious worries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking at the situation, =\r\nIMHO, it is very early to think about stopping the same. Though intentions =\r\nfor specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not known, I believe that i=\r\nt was for some or the other Saatwik desire (Even it may have been mundane a=\r\nnd not speeding up spiritual progress). Also, it defies the logic to attach=\r\n incidences to Homam with experiences of just a couple of days.\n&gt; For that =\r\nmatter, even Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if I take my own personal exp=\r\neriences. I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati Homas as well as Chandi ho=\r\nmas and I have had many set backs and some good things as well but again th=\r\nose are all part & parcel of life. Even without Homam, one may experience s=\r\nuch dualistic situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand your insistence and your pruden=\r\nt advice to worship Soumya Devatas and I agree to your logic which is most =\r\nprobably out of your experiences, however I also think that Ugra Devata sho=\r\nuld not be that fearful while Soumya Devatas are not that Goody-goody. Ulti=\r\nmately, it is all about attraction/liking for a particular deity. It is my =\r\npersonal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Sou=\r\nmya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which one feels most attra=\r\ncted and then forget about the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on =\r\nmind of a person to start judging and relating day to day experiences with =\r\nhomam. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva =\r\nor Hanuman or any other deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chose=\r\nn deity, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts going wrong, one need =\r\nnot despair and should keep faith till it is impossible because if God exis=\r\nt, there never would be a breaking point and that holds true for all of us =\r\nwhether we have families to look after or not.\n&gt; I completely tend to agree=\r\n and hence repeat for benefits of others that Ganapati is not a Lower devat=\r\na. He is capable of everything. If one has a great liking for him, one can =\r\nkeep on performing his homam without need of switching. Actually to switch =\r\nfrom Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing of Levels (esp=\r\necially from Lower to upper) which some may think.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Utp=\r\nal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The point raised by Biswajit is a genuine =\r\none.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress requires freedom from the burden of some k=\r\ney blocking \n&gt; &gt; karmas. One way to be free from a karma is to experience t=\r\nhe reaction to \n&gt; &gt; it in full (in due course of time). Another way is to b=\r\nurn it in \n&gt; &gt; sadhana. When one meditates or helps people or engages in va=\r\nrious \n&gt; &gt; spiritual practices also, some karmas are getting burnt and bein=\r\ng taken \n&gt; &gt; off one&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like homam accelerate tha=\r\nt process. \n&gt; &gt; Homam of ugra devatas accelerates it further. The distincti=\r\non is between \n&gt; &gt; soumya devatas and ugra devatas is a very important one.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I gave this analogy a few times before. Suppose there is a basket=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; containing fruits (your karmas). Suppose a good fruit (good karma) is=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; stuck under some rotten fruits (bad karmas). When you do sadhana, the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; deity (personification of certain good qualities within you, which ar=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; being  strengthened as you do the sadhana) re-arranges the kaarmik \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of the analogy, some rotten fruits are taken out and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; thrown in garbage and the good fruit is given to you to eat. If this =\r\nis \n&gt; &gt; done slowly and carefully, it takes longer to take the good fruit o=\r\nut, \n&gt; &gt; but the spillage of rotten fruit pieces on the floor is minimized.=\r\n This \n&gt; &gt; is the way of soumya devatas (gentle deities). If this is done f=\r\nast and \n&gt; &gt; aggressively, the good fruit comes out faster, but the spillag=\r\ne of \n&gt; &gt; rotten fruit pieces is more. This is the way of ugra devatas (fie=\r\nrce \n&gt; &gt; deities). It is a tradeoff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAs I recommended before, those who want their material life to go \n&gt; &gt; smoo=\r\nthly and not in a hurry for spiritual progress should stick to \n&gt; &gt; soumya =\r\ndevatas. Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vishnu, Krishna etc can \n&gt; &gt; be wor=\r\nshipped in fire. Once one starts worshipping fierce forms like \n&gt; &gt; Chandi,=\r\n Durga, Narasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, especially in \n&gt; &gt; fire, =\r\nthings CAN be too fast for them to handle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, it is a good i=\r\ndea to just stick to Ganapathi homam for a few \n&gt; &gt; months, before starting=\r\n to worship any other deity. There is no need to \n&gt; &gt; be in a hurry to &quot;gra=\r\nduate&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else. Ganapathi \n&gt; &gt; is now lower and is =\r\ncapable of giving everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most pe=\r\nople today do not understand Mahavidyas at all. For example, \n&gt; &gt; based on =\r\nliteral meanings of some scriptural sayings, they think that \n&gt; &gt; Bagalamuk=\r\nhi is for success over enemies and success in litigation etc. \n&gt; &gt; Some peo=\r\nple suggest specific Mahavidya sadhanas for material benefits \n&gt; &gt; based on=\r\n horoscopic combinations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vidya means knowledge. Mahavidya means s=\r\nupreme knowledge. No knowledge \n&gt; &gt; that enables one to win court cases or =\r\ndefeat enemies or to get other \n&gt; &gt; temporary material results can be terme=\r\nd as &quot;supreme&quot; knowledge. \n&gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are far more serious. They stand =\r\nfor different aspects of the \n&gt; &gt; knowledge of Self, which is the only supr=\r\neme knowledge. They are the \n&gt; &gt; liberating forms of the divine Mother.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Most people on earth today are unready for their worship. People toda=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; need deities who can take care of material things and give some push=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serious liberating forces such as Mahavidyas =\r\nare \n&gt; &gt; inappropriate for one who worries about little things. I mean no \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; disrespect - worrying about little things is not unusual for most peopl=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; and is ok - but then think twice before worshipping Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n especially in a fruitful medium such as fire. Fire amplifies the impact \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of the mantra and surrounding thoughts on the subtle body and \n&gt; &gt; accel=\r\nerates the results, compared to normal meditation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Consider the above words carefully and skip ugra devatas and =\r\nMahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; atleast for a while in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, in th=\r\ne beginning, some mistakes may be made. Just as Shiva drank \n&gt; &gt; the poison=\r\n that came out first during the churning of milky ocean, Guru \n&gt; &gt; gives pr=\r\notection in the beginning. If you have a spiritual guru, think \n&gt; &gt; of him/=\r\nher before the homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think of me or my guru=\r\n Dr Manish Pandit. Better \n&gt; &gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Swami (Shri Vasudev=\r\nananda Saraswati Maharaj), \n&gt; &gt; Shri Gulwani Maharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman Ra=\r\no Dattatreya Gulwani), Shri \n&gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj and Manish Pandit. That is=\r\n my Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, you can also think of Dattatreya or=\r\n Krishna or Shiva as your \n&gt; &gt; guru based on your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n  Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twi=\r\ntter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Mar 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM, biswa108 wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     NAMASKAR\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, got the point... but my point is W=\r\nhether I am ready for burning \n&gt; &gt; kermik debit with this kind of speed... =\r\nI am a family man after all... \n&gt; &gt; It would not be a problem at all if I a=\r\nm a Sadhu... but I am not, I have \n&gt; &gt; some responsibilitis (Rnabandhana) l=\r\neft for my family...
