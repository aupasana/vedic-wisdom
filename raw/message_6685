I used to remember god 24 hors a day. But in 1990 I start=\r\ned fearing god and now I hate him so much so that I destroyed my home made =\r\ntemple and his posters. why i did so the reason is as below:\n&gt; I am sufferi=\r\nng from ocd (Obsessive compulsive disorder) since 1990. My problem is that =\r\nwhenever I am doing some work some part of my mind says that if this work g=\r\nets done I will go to temple but it is not me and I counter this thought by=\r\n saying that I will not go to temple. But at the completion of the work I a=\r\nm compelled to go to temple. The problem is that I have to go to temple com=\r\npulsively and many times again and again. Also the temple which comes to my=\r\n thoughts has to be visited to satisfy my compulsion. Even a simple thought=\r\n that if my son answers the question I will go to temple. I am not even abl=\r\ne to teach him. I cant cross the road where there is a temple. How can I av=\r\noid that. There are temples all around the world. Please help me out. For p=\r\nast 10 yrs I am taking allopathy medicine. For past 7 months I am taking ho=\r\nmeopathy also. But sometimes it goes out of control. Please guide me how ca=\r\nn I stop hating GOD. \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Dob :16th april,1975\n&gt; Place:  kangra =\r\n(Himachal Pradesh)\n&gt; Time : 8 pm\n&gt; \n&gt; a\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
