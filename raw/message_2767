SRI SWAMI SIVANANDAJI MAHARAJ)\n\nThe=\r\n path of the spiritual aspirant verily lies through a bewildering jungle of=\r\n difficulties and dilemmas of problems and paradoxes. One of such vexing pa=\r\nradoxes is that your mind is both your best friend as also your most bitter=\r\n enemy. Mind becomes a true friend, only after being gradually trained to b=\r\ne so. Mind begins to be really helpful after the aspirant has progressed su=\r\nfficiently in spiritual Sadhana. Until then it should be regarded as a trou=\r\nblesome and treacherous enemy inside us. It is extremely diplomatic, cunnin=\r\ng and crooked. It is an arch-deceiver. One of the master-strokes of the min=\r\nd&#39;s artfulness is to make the aspirant feel and smugly imagine that he know=\r\ns his mind perfectly well and cannot be led away by it and at the same time=\r\n to delude him totally. The mind has the knack of making the unwary aspiran=\r\nt confidently think himself its master, while it makes a hopeless fool of h=\r\nim. Its deceptions are subtle.\n\nYou have heard the saying, &quot;The Devil can q=\r\nuote scriptures for its purpose&quot;. Similarly the mind can use a virtue to in=\r\ndulge in a vice. It has an inborn inclination to perversion. It can even ta=\r\nke the support of a perfectly good principle to seemingly justify the most =\r\nunprincipled sort of action. Unless it is scrutinised dispassionately, its =\r\ntricks are never fully discovered.\n\nCertain of the perversions usually noti=\r\nceable are described below. This will be valuable to sincere aspirants who =\r\nare eager to study their minds and eliminate defects and shortcomings. Thes=\r\ne are extremely useful tips specially in the working field, for aspirants e=\r\nngaged in active Seva in the midst of other people.\n\nSadhaks are told, &quot;Kee=\r\np up Matri-bhava or Devi-bhava when you move with women.&quot; This is a grand p=\r\nrinciple to safeguard your purity and spiritual progress. But this does not=\r\n tell you, &quot;Move with women.&quot; Nor does this advice mean that if you try to =\r\nhave this attitude then you may go on freely mixing with the opposite sex w=\r\nithout any limit or restraint. The mind will ask, &quot;Why not? What if I do? T=\r\no retreat from their presence is sheer timidity? No fear when you do so wit=\r\nh Devi-bhava!&quot; Beware, O Aspirant, beware of this tendency! Divine Bhava is=\r\n not a license to throw away all restrictions of the Sadhaka&#39;s path. The pe=\r\nrmanent injunction for Sadhakas is to totally eschew all contact with the o=\r\npposite sex. When unavoidably such contact becomes necessary, then, &quot;Have M=\r\natri-bhava; have Devi-bhava&quot; etc., are prescribed. Also this is to caution =\r\nthe aspirant not to hate women or become a misogynist. Women should be reve=\r\nrenced but from a safe distance. Let not Devi-bhava etc., be taken to mean =\r\nthat you should be all the time in the midst of them. Watch your mind!\n\nThe=\r\nn there is the advice which says, &quot;You may hiss but not bite.&quot; This safe co=\r\nunsel was given to a fabulous snake which in a too extreme access of piety =\r\nbecame so totally docile and harmless that it got severely mal-handled by a=\r\n set of mischievous urchins. It was given as an example to over-timid house=\r\nholders and people struggling in the very midst of the harsh realities of c=\r\nompetitive `vyavaharic&#39; life. Here an overdose of `Avanty-brahmin&#39;-like hum=\r\nility might well make life impossible amidst the Asuric elements abounding =\r\nin the world. Therefore, just an outward show of pugnacity may be countenan=\r\nced in so far as this does not affect your basic goodness and brotherhood. =\r\nBut this policy is not for the spiritual aspirant in the path of Sadhana an=\r\nd Nivritti. Definitely not. Let aspirants take heed of these words. The Sad=\r\nhak is neither to &#39;bite&#39; nor is he to `hiss&#39; even. This &#39;hissing&#39; business =\r\nwill soon become a part of your nature. You will soon find yourself hissing=\r\n for everything, at everything, at everyone, in and out of season. This his=\r\ns will include every variety of rudeness ranging from hot argument, sharp r=\r\netort, curt reply to angry glaring, shouting and abuse. In short of physica=\r\nl violence and fight, every type of verbal brutality will be put into the &quot;=\r\nhissing&quot; category. This will ultimately lead to spiritual ruin. The mind is=\r\n ever waiting to take advantage of even the least concession shown to it. I=\r\nts natural tendency is to go downward. O Aspirant, do not bite or even &#39;his=\r\ns&#39;. Be humble, be sweet, be gentle. Be firm but be soft, polite and courteo=\r\nus. If you wish to &#39;hiss&#39; then &#39;hiss&#39; at your own mind. Thrash the ego. Fig=\r\nht the Shad-ripus. Watch the mind!\n\nAnother victim to perversion is the pie=\r\nce of advice, &quot;Be resolute. Stick to your priniciples. Never budge an inch.=\r\n&quot; The best possible advice to a sincere Sadhaka; but unfortunately often ma=\r\nde the basis for the worst possible trait i.e., obstinacy. This is a Tamasi=\r\nc trait. But the mind will make believe that you are manifesting Atma-bal o=\r\nr a divine determination. This is its work=97to make him cling tightly to h=\r\nis ego. Hence this deception. But the careful aspirant must discern the dif=\r\nference between Sattvic Nishta and sheer stubbornness. Atma-bal is not a ch=\r\neap commodity to be got without a great deal of earnest struggle, disciplin=\r\ne and Will-culture. Determined adherence is advocated in respect of truly h=\r\nigh and noble principles and not of self-conceited notions. By all means st=\r\nick to spiritual Yogic Niyamas but avoid becoming obdurate in nature. Do no=\r\nt be deceived. Watch your mind!\n\n&quot;Speak the Truth always. Be frank.&quot; Thus i=\r\ns the Upadesh. This means when you are required to talk then speak only the=\r\n truth. It does not at all mean that you must go about telling everyone to =\r\nhis face what exactly you think of him or her. This is unwarranted behaviou=\r\nr. Under the garb of frankness to give free expression of opinions without =\r\ncaring for other peoples&#39; feelings is not `Aarjava&#39; or frankness or straigh=\r\ntforwardness. At the least it is thoughtlessness; at its height it is sheer=\r\n brutality. It does not bespeak well of an aspirant. The same teacher who t=\r\nells you &quot;Speak truth; be frank!&quot; also tells you to have &quot;Mita Bhashan, Mad=\r\nhura Bhashan&quot; moderate and sweet speech. Mind can even make you to utilise =\r\nfrankness in order to express mild insult. An unpleasant truth is better le=\r\nft unsaid. If it becomes absolutely necessary and unavoidable then say it s=\r\nweetly and with humility. &quot;Not to hurt and wound others&#39; feelings&quot; is as eq=\r\nually important as speaking truth. Satyam and Ahimsa must go together. Stud=\r\ny thyself. Watch the mind!\n\nThen there is the truism i.e., &quot;Vairagya is rea=\r\nlly a mental state, mental detachment.&quot; The mind takes hold of this definit=\r\nion to justify a heedless sensual life without self-restraint, or principle=\r\n. The argument will always be, &quot;O! I am not attached to all this. I can ris=\r\ne above it in a moment. I enjoy it as a master. Mentally I am detached.&quot; Co=\r\nntact with Vishyas have toppled down even Tapasvins like Vishwamitra. There=\r\nfore, do not take Vairagya lightly. Culitvate Vairagya diligently. Safeguar=\r\nd your Vairagya carefully. Be vigilant. Watch the mind!\n\nThe caution not to=\r\n go to extremes in Tapasya also gets a like fate. Man&#39;s normal nature is se=\r\nnsuous. The mind wants comforts and hates austerity. The indiscriminating a=\r\nspirant conveniently ignores the qualifying adjective &quot;extremes&quot; in the adv=\r\nice quoted above and views all `Tapasya&#39; with disfavour. The result is to d=\r\negenerate into luxury, lose even the minimum of Titiksha and become a slave=\r\n to hundred wants. The warning is against foolish extremes but to a Sadhaka=\r\n in the early stages a certain degree of austerity is essential for develop=\r\nment. The mind will suggest so many justifications. It will bring Gita to i=\r\nts side and show that the Lord condemned Tapas. O aspirant, the Lord condem=\r\nned &#39;Tamasic Tapas.&#39; He recommended Sattvic austerity of body, speech and m=\r\nind. Reflect carefully. Always watch the mind!\n\n&quot;Take care of essentials. D=\r\no not pay too much attention to non-essentials.&quot; The above too serves as a =\r\nhandle for the mind to deceive the aspirant. If you have to follow this adv=\r\nice, first try to understand what is essential and what is non-essential. T=\r\nhe idle nature of man is to loath following any sort of `Niyama&#39; and set-li=\r\nnes of Sadhachara. Therefore, everything is dismissed at a stroke as `non-e=\r\nssential.&#39; Then what remains, God only can say. The only `essential&#39; would =\r\nseem to be to do what the mind likes. The Sadhak must think what a Spiritua=\r\nl instruction really means and then why it is given. Moreover, essentials a=\r\nnd non-essentials vary according to the stage of development of the spiritu=\r\nal aspirant. What may be unnecessary to an aspirant at a later stage may we=\r\nll be essential to him now. Do not throw away precious grain with the chaff=\r\n. Watch the mind!\n\nFinally the most dangerous deception played by the mind =\r\nis in connection with Sadhana itself. The very Sadhana that is adopted by t=\r\nhe aspirant to transfigure and divinise his life is converted into a prop a=\r\nnd a field for the play of ego and senses. It is very difficult to break ou=\r\nt of this ensnaring net without great earnestness and sincere endeavour. It=\r\n is this vitiation of Sadhana that keeps the Sadhak `stuck&#39;, as it were, on=\r\n the path, arresting progress for years together. For example, youthful Sad=\r\nhaks with sweet voice and musical talent naturally take to Kirtan and Bhaja=\r\nn as their Sadhana. Art always attracts admirers. He is in demand at all au=\r\nspicious functions. He gets popular amongst Satsangis. The subtle mind now =\r\nspreads the net. The Kirtan becomes sweeter day by day. New songs and tunes=\r\n are added to his musical repertory. Without his being aware, the Kirtan ha=\r\ns become a means to attract others to himself and to maintain the popularit=\r\ny. Thus the `Sadhana&#39; becomes double-purposed=97primarily for God&#39;s Darshan=\r\na and side by side for worldly attraction. The result is the extraordinary =\r\nphenomenon of the Sadhak caught in his Sadhana. Instead of Mochana, the qua=\r\nlity of Sadhana becomes Bandhana. Maya is wonderful, indescribable. Her way=\r\ns are mysterious and inscrutable.\n\nTake Nishkama Karma Yoga. Serving and he=\r\nlping others for no return is something unheard of in the purely Vyavaharic=\r\n world. Naturally the disinterested Sevak is regarded as an exceptional bei=\r\nng. All doors are open unto him. Many bring their troubles to him, open the=\r\nir hearts and freely confide even intimate problems. They, of course, take =\r\nit for granted that the spiritual aspirant is perfectly pure in every respe=\r\nct. Here the Sadhak walks upon the `razor-edge&#39; of life. The mind is the de=\r\nvil. Through the very intimacy of contacts in the Seva field, pleasure cent=\r\nres are created and sensuousness gets scope in this Seva &#39;Sadhana&#39;. Vanity =\r\nand carnality get catered to and the aspirant appears to take a keen intere=\r\nst in the Nishkama Seva. But a ruthless search of the mind will reveal that=\r\n the keenness and interest in the Karma Yoga Seva is as much for the sense-=\r\nindulgence to be had in the Seva as for the Seva itself. So the mind destro=\r\nys the Sadhana.\n\nAspirants practising Titiksha many a time stick on to the =\r\nTitiksha for similar subconscious reasons. His endurance will earn for him =\r\na reputation. He will be regarded as extraordinary. So even after the Titik=\r\nsha Sahdana has served its purpose he will keep on with it for continuing t=\r\nhe status it has granted him. Another Sadhak will under the idea of being i=\r\nndifferent towards the body and its needs, neglects to shave even. This wil=\r\nl be quite sincere and bonafide in the beginning. But the long hair and bea=\r\nrd that results out of this &#39;udaseenata&#39; will prove the instrument for Maya=\r\n to lay hold of the aspirant. The hair will be found to beautify his appear=\r\nance. He is loath to part with it. Thus the former &quot;udaseenata&quot; will be rep=\r\nlaced by careful combing of the hair, application of oil, peeps into the mi=\r\nrror, dressing to suit, the style of the hair, new mannerisms, etc. Thus in=\r\n a trice will delusion spring upon you and overpower you like the tiger doe=\r\ns its prey. Likewise Hatha Yogic exercise get misused to sustain gluttony; =\r\nVajroli is used for Vybhichara and Yoga is made to serve Bhoga. All these p=\r\nerversions arise out of the mischief of the unregenerate mind. Therefore wa=\r\ntch the mind!\n\nThe most extraordinary part of all this is that the mind wil=\r\nl not allow you to take the above lessons seriously. It will still say, &quot;O =\r\nyou are all right. This is not meant for you. Don&#39;t mind all this. Carry on=\r\n as you are.&quot; O aspirant do not listen to it! Non-cooperate with the rogue.=\r\n Take the lessons to heart.\n\nTo know where exactly one stands on the path i=\r\ns very difficult. The tricks of the mind are most subtle. Only constant Vic=\r\nhar will keep you alert and safe. Deep introspection alone can reveal a lit=\r\ntle of the mysterious workings. Probe and probe into the mind. Do not be le=\r\nnient to the mind. The mind will try to compromise with you. Relentlessly h=\r\nunt out its hidden motives. Subject yourself to keen self-analysis everyday=\r\n without fail. Oust all sentiment in this process. Become an intelligent, s=\r\nerious and earnest self-C.I.D. Carry on a ceaseless search and a vigorous e=\r\nnquiry inwardly. Put your mind on the dissecting table of Vichar. Pray for =\r\nthe Grace of the Guru who alone can vanquish the mind and enable you to mas=\r\nter it. Pray to the Lord to illumine your intellect with the light of knowl=\r\nedge. Watch the mind. Watch and pray. Thus alone, through introspection, an=\r\nalysis, discrimination, vigilance and prayer can you understand the subtle =\r\njugglery of this wonderful thing called &#39;mind&#39; and transcend its deceptions=\r\n and tricks.\n\nMay the Lord enable you to realise the importance of the disc=\r\nipline of the mind. May He crown your spiritual life with success and highe=\r\nst attainment!\n\n\n"}}
