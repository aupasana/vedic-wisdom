One of the robbers said, &quot;What&#39;s the use of keeping =\r\nthis man alive?&quot; So saying, he was about to kill him with his sword, when t=\r\nhe second robber interrupted him, saying: &#39;Oh, no! What is the use of killi=\r\nng him? Tie his hand and foot and leave him here.&quot; The robbers bound his ha=\r\nnds and feet and went away. After a while the third robber returned and sai=\r\nd to the man: &quot;Ah, I am sorry. Are you hurt? I will release you from your b=\r\nonds.&quot; After setting the man free, the thief said: &quot;Come with me. I will ta=\r\nke you to the public high way.&quot; After a long time they reached the road. At=\r\n this the man said: &quot;Sir, you have been very good to me. Come with me to my=\r\n house.&quot; &quot;Oh,no!&quot; the robber replied. &quot;I can&#39;t go there. The police will kn=\r\now it.&quot;\n\n  This world itself is the forest. The three robbers prowling here=\r\n are Satva, rajas, and lamas. It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of=\r\n Truth. Tamas wants to destroy him.Rajas binds him to the world.\n\n  But Sat=\r\nva rescues him from the clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the protection o=\r\nf Satva, man is rescued from anger, passion and other evil effects of tamas=\r\n.\n\n  Further, Satva loosens the bonds of the world. But Satva also is a rob=\r\nber. It cannot give man the ultimate Knowledge of Truth, though it shows hi=\r\nm the road leading to the Supreme Abode of God.Setting him on the path, Sat=\r\nva tells him: &quot;Look yonder. There is your home.&quot; Even Satva is far away fro=\r\nm the knowledge of Brahman.\n\n  Source: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishn=\r\na\n  -- \r\n------=_NextPart_000_00FC_01CA46DC.4D81EBB0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: smal=\r\nler; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: center 50=\r\n%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62px; =\r\nBORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 62px;=\r\n BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV=\r\n.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hover {\n=\r\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none=\r\n\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.at=\r\ntach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING=\r\n-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row =\r\nDIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DIV DI=\r\nV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold\n}\n=\r\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8=\r\nd8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#ygrp-=\r\nmkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;\n  f=\r\nont-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0px=\r\n;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: 0 0;=\r\n\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3603&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nbgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;Thank you for the story.
