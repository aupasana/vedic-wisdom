We can understand that. But wait a minute here.. what is God saying? Is H=\r\ne promising to haul groceries on His own back and deliver them to His devot=\r\nees? And also, be their personal chowkidar?\n&gt; God hauled groceries for Arju=\r\nn Mishra. That is the story I came to tell you today. His story is found in=\r\n the Bhaktamaal grantha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pundit Arjun Mishra lived with his wife in Pu=\r\nri, Orissa. I do not know his exact time, but after talking with some infor=\r\nmed people, got the impression that they lived between 150-200 years ago. P=\r\nuri is also known as the Purushottam kshetra ( Land of Lord Purushottama Ja=\r\ngannatha ). The famous Jagannatha temple is here. The ancient history of th=\r\nis holy place is described in the Skanda Puran (Vishnu Khanda-Purushottam M=\r\nahatmyam).\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, back to the story=85 Arjun Mishra and his wife did not=\r\n have much material wealth. In fact, they were poorer than most poor. Like =\r\nother Brahmins in those days, he never showed any interest in making money.=\r\n His life was for studying the Gita and the Bhagavata. He was a great devot=\r\nee and saw the world as Krishna-maya. That means, he saw Sri Krishna everyw=\r\nhere and in everybody, pervading the universe. The world is seen that way b=\r\ny the exalted devotees.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you can imagine, such devotees are entirely=\r\n unselfish. Arjun Mishra wanted to find a way to share his most valued weal=\r\nth: his learning and his Spiritual experiences. What should he do?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We=\r\nll, the jagadgurus wrote commentaries on the Gita&quot; thought Arjun Mishra, &quot;I=\r\n might just do that as well=85.I would certainly love to discuss those vers=\r\nes where I can mention my own Spiritual experiences.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was thinking =\r\nabout this verse\n&gt; yena bhutaani asheshhena drakshyasi aatmani atho mayi. 4=\r\n.35\n&gt; By which (Spiritual knowledge) you will (initially) see all beings in=\r\n your Atman and then (see all) in Me.\n&gt; \n&gt; And this verse,\n&gt; Vidya vinaya s=\r\nampanne braahmane gavi hastini\n&gt; shuni cha eva shvapaake cha panditaah sama=\r\ndarshanah. 5.18\n&gt; The pundits see a wise and humble Brahmin, a cow, an elep=\r\nhant, a dog and a dog-eater to be equal (in Spirit).\n&gt; \n&gt; And these verses,=\r\n\n&gt; Samam sarveshu bhuteshu tishthantam parameshvaram. 13.27\n&gt; The Parameshw=\r\nar is equally present in all beings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yadaa bhuta prithagbhaavam ekasth=\r\nam anupashyati\n&gt; Tata eva cha vistaaram brahma sampadyate tadaa. 13.30\n&gt; Wh=\r\nen (someone) sees the beings of all different characteristics to be one (in=\r\n Spirit) and sees them to be expanded from That, then (that person) attains=\r\n the Brahman.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such Spititual vision of the world has been called sama-=\r\ndarshan (equal vision) in the Gita. Sri Krishna said that these exalted dev=\r\notees obtain paraa-bhakti (unwavering devotion) (18. 54). Arjun Mishra was =\r\nready for it. Still, he had some lingering doubts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But=85 do I really=\r\n know enough to write about the whole Gita?&quot; he wondered. &quot;Well, let&#39;s look=\r\n at it this way=85Arjuna heard the Gita from Sri Krishna Himself and saw Hi=\r\ns vishwarupa; yet sage Suta did not consider him a boddhaa (knower) of the =\r\nGita, just someone who knows &quot;kinchit phalam&quot; (a bit of the benefits).\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n krishno janati vai samyak, kincit kunti-sutah phalam. Gita Mahatmya 3 (Vai=\r\nshnava tantra saara).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Krishna certainly knows (the Gita), the son =\r\nof Kunti (Arjuna) knows a bit of its benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; And again, acharya Madh=\r\nva initially thought that he could say about his commentary of the Gita tha=\r\nt his goal was to, &quot;bakshyaami shaktitah&quot; (describe as far as I can), but l=\r\nater, he changed it to &quot;bakshyaami leshatah&quot; (describe, only be a tiny part=\r\n of the teachings).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, nobody can be wise enough to discuss ever=\r\ny message in the words of God. Those thoughts humbled Arjun Mishra very muc=\r\nh. But then, he wanted to write the commentary. So he reasoned, &quot;if I get s=\r\ntuck, I will ask Sri Krishna to help me out with the meaning and wait. I am=\r\n not going to rationalize, but just wait for Sri Krishna. May be Sri Krishn=\r\na will have mercy on me, and teach me personally! Nothing can be more wonde=\r\nrful.&quot;\n&gt; He was doing fine with writing the commentary until he came to ver=\r\nse 9.22 (that&#39;s the verse in the beginning of this story). A doubt came to =\r\nhis mind. Vahaamyaham? Can it really be true? God lugging provisions on His=\r\n own back? How can that be? He believed in God&#39;s words in the Gita, but jus=\r\nt couldn&#39;t accept that God can also be the porter for His devotees.\n&gt; \n&gt; He=\r\n had promised to himself that he will not rationalize, but that&#39;s exactly w=\r\nhat he started doing. He reasoned, &quot;May be God means that He will arrange t=\r\nhe delivery by someone else.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thinking so, he drew a line through the =\r\nword vahaamyaham in his commentary with red ink. Isn&#39;t it interesting how w=\r\ne want God to conform to our model of Him? But the devotee in Arjun Mishra =\r\ntook over soon. He remembered his vow about not rationalizing. He suddenly =\r\nbecame very disappointed with himself. He stopped writing and got up, with =\r\na sad heart that he just broke his vow. What could he do? After a while, he=\r\n got back some of his composure and said a prayer to Sri Krishna in all hum=\r\nility, &quot;Please teach me, O Madhava! I am ignorant and foolish and I do not =\r\nknow what you mean by vahaamyaham. Please teach me, and guide me so the com=\r\nmentary can be completed. You give so much help to Your devotees. I know I =\r\nam only a poor undeserving devotee, but please have mercy on me and help me=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was already mid-morning. His wife came to see him and said, &quot;We =\r\nhave no food today. You have been writing since morning. Please go to beg f=\r\nor alms, otherwise we will have to go hungry.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra went out f=\r\nor the alms. In those days, people considered it an honor to give food grai=\r\nns and vegetables to Brahmins like him. Their begging is called maadhukari.=\r\n Arjun Mishra was distraught from the morning, so he thought that he would =\r\ngo to take a dip in the holy Rohini kunda first. He set out from home, the =\r\nkunda was a little distance away.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he was walking towards the kunda,=\r\n he remembered the story of the old crow in the Skanda puran. When the crow=\r\n realized that death was near, it flew to the Rohini Kunda and took a bath =\r\nin the water and then looked devotedly at Lord Jagannatha on the temple alt=\r\ner. Soon afterwards, it died and became free from life. Arjun Mishra though=\r\nt that taking a dip in such a holy water will help him as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; While =\r\nhe was gone, two young boys arrived at the Mishra home with big sacks on th=\r\neir backs, huffing and puffing from the load. They looked miserable and wer=\r\ne crying loudly. Arjun Mishra&#39;s wife was sitting on the verandah, looking o=\r\nut for her husband. When she saw the boys, she came down the steps running,=\r\n very concerned. She was an extremely kind lady.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What happened to you=\r\n, my children? Why are you crying? I cannot understand who would hurt such =\r\nyoung boys. Who is making you carry such heavy sacks? Where are you going?&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Saying so, she helped them unload the sacks. Then she had the shock o=\r\nf her life. She discovered deep lateral scars of fresh injury on their back=\r\ns. Blood was oozing out from their scars. &quot;Oh! What kind of heartless perso=\r\nn can beat small children in this manner?&quot; she exclaimed.\n&gt; \n&gt; She picked t=\r\nhe two boys up in her arms and brought them inside the house&#2404; She sat=\r\n them down on wooden seats they had in the verandah, and ran inside. There =\r\nwas no food in the house, so she brought two cups of cold water for them. A=\r\nfter drinking the water, the boys looked slightly more comfortable. They sa=\r\nid to her, &quot;Ma! Punditji beat us, and made us carry the grocery sacks. Thos=\r\ne groceries are for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My husband has beaten you? But I have never=\r\n known him to be angry&#2404; For what reason? When did he beat you? What d=\r\nid he beat you with?&quot; she almost collapsed in shock.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We do not know w=\r\nhy, Ma&#2404; But he beat us with a sharp stick of iron&quot; they said&#2404; &quot;=\r\nJust a little while ago&#2404;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She could not wait for all the answers=\r\n. She had to take care of their wounds first. She ran inside again, and cam=\r\ne back with a big pot of water and some bandage cloth. They had a ghritakum=\r\nari (aloe vera) plant in the yard; she ran to it and broke a fat leaf. Then=\r\n she mashed the leaf with her masala-grinding stone and collected the expre=\r\nssed resin. She was now ready to dress their wounds. She cleaned their woun=\r\nds, put a little of the ghritakumari extract and made a cloth bandage. The =\r\nghritakumari resin soothed their wounds and the boys were feeling a lot bet=\r\nter.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Our friends are waiting for us for play. We want to go, Ma&quot; they=\r\n said. Then they bowed before her and left.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra&#39;s wife was ha=\r\nppy that she could help them feel better. She also knew how little boys are=\r\n.. always short on patience. So, she hugged them and did not press for more=\r\n answers and let them go. Then her thoughts turned again to her husband. Sh=\r\ne just did not understand how her gentle husband could have hurt those boys=\r\n. Anyway, she did not have time to think too much. She needed to start cook=\r\ning. So she picked up the groceries and started cooking. Her husband should=\r\n come back any time now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra had taken the vow of three-house=\r\n maadhukari. He would only go to three houses and accept one handful of ric=\r\ne and some vegetables from each house. It had rained heavily the night befo=\r\nre and it rained all morning. The three houses he went to, were all flooded=\r\n. He called out, but nobody was home. People had left for higher ground. So=\r\n he came back home empty-handed. When he got home, he found his wife was co=\r\noking something. He thought that somebody must have brought some food for t=\r\nhem.\n&gt; \n&gt; He announced, &quot;My love, the rains have flooded a lot of houses. N=\r\nobody was there to give me alms today. But I see you are cooking, who broug=\r\nht us food?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His wife was crying, &quot;How could you beat those two little=\r\n boys?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What do you mean? I beat two boys? I didn&#39;t beat any boys.&quot; H=\r\ne exclaimed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You didn&#39;t beat them?&quot; She said in disbelief.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Why =\r\nshould I beat anybody? You saw what I was doing since morning. I was writin=\r\ng about the Gita. Then I went to the Rohini kunda and took a bath. Then I w=\r\nent for maadhukari. From there, I came straight back home. I did not see an=\r\ny boys.&quot; He said in defense.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You did beat them. They told me how you =\r\nbeat them with a sharp stick of iron. They had scars across their backs, an=\r\nd were bleeding. I treated them with ghritakumari myself. &quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;I did not beat anybody. I didn&#39;t. Why should I lie to you?&quot; he insisted.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;Making them carry those heavy sacks was bad enough. What did they do t=\r\nhat you beat them with a sharp iron stick?&quot; She grumbled, clearly not belie=\r\nving her husband.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I do not know what you are talking about.&quot; Arjun Mi=\r\nshra retorted. He went inside to the room where he was writing in the morni=\r\nng. He was about to sit down, but his wife followed him there.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come n=\r\now and eat. I have much work to do. I have to clean after you.&quot; She said.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;All right, I am coming. But I am very unhappy that you do not believe =\r\nme.&quot; He said.\n&gt; Arjun Mishra followed her and sat down to eat. &quot;I do not un=\r\nderstand how the day is going. First, I get stuck with a verse. Then I do n=\r\not get any maadhukari. Then you say that I beat up two young boys.&quot; He mumb=\r\nled. &quot;Who brought us the food?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Those two boys, who else? You had sen=\r\nt them with the food, they told me.&quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I sent two boys with f=\r\nood? I did not do any such thing. Are you sure they brought the food for us=\r\n?&quot; He asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They said your name. And said that you made them carry t=\r\nhe sacks of food and bring to me.&quot; She said, &quot;Eat now. I have work to do.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whose children are they? Do you know them?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No. I do =\r\nnot. They are not from our village.&quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Not from our village? =\r\nWhat did they look like?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They were cute little boys. The y=\r\nounger one was dark and the older one was fair.&quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishr=\r\na did not need any more clues. He immediately realized who the two boys wer=\r\ne: they were Sri Krishna and Balarama. In the morning, he had doubted that =\r\nSri Krishna will personally carry provisions for his devotees. To show him =\r\nthat He does, He carried a sack of groceries on His back. He even made Sri =\r\nBalarama carry a second sack for them for another meal. And, he struck out =\r\nthe word vahaamyaham with red ink. That mark Sri Krishna carried as injury.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra could eat no more. He was chocking with emotion. He had =\r\npicked up a morsel, but he put that on his head and sat there in silence. T=\r\nears streamed out from his eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; His wife was perplexed. &quot;What happene=\r\nd?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My love, this is no mere food, this is prasad. Those boys were Sr=\r\ni Krishna and Balarama. You are so fortunate that you saw them. Eat some of=\r\n the prasad yourself and let&#39;s go out to fetch everybody in the village. Th=\r\nis we should share with everyone.&quot; He said excitedly.Then he explained to h=\r\ner what had happened since morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; She ate some prasad excitedly. Aft=\r\ner that, they had a big celebration with the neighbors sharing the prasad. =\r\nThere were lots of Harinam singing and ecstatic dancing. After everyone had=\r\n gone home, Arjun Mishra went to his writing room. He wrote: vahaamyaham, v=\r\nahaamyaham, vahaamyaham. He was convinced of God&#39;s promise to His devotees.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra wrote an excellent commentary of the Gita with real Spir=\r\nitual insights. His commentary is famous for the triple mention of vahaamya=\r\nham. The message of this story is that we should never seek an imaginary re=\r\nlationship with God and trust God to personally help us, teach us and at th=\r\ne end, liberate us. If we do not have that confidence, we are not worthy of=\r\n being called devotees.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
