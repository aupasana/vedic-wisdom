The impact of a Bahaullah or a Sai Baba or a Swami Vivekananda=\r\n may be many times higher. God has a plan of what to do with which part of =\r\nthe world and with which religion, at which time.

He did that=\r\n inside a mosque, which is considered blasphemous as Islam considers fire t=\r\no be very inauspicious! He gave sublime interpretations of Qoran and also B=\r\nhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures. He never hesitated to tell a Hindu=\r\n, &quot;Allah will do good to you&quot; or to tell a Muslim, &quot;Ram will bless you&quot;. Hi=\r\nndus and Muslims alike considered him their own and worshipped him.

Great teachers effectively cook the raw grains=\r\n of scriptural essence using the heat of their wisdom and the water of thei=\r\nr compassion and serve cooked food ready for consumption by people around t=\r\nhem.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When people stick to some irrelevant details and miss the essenc=\r\ne, it can result in clashes and conflicts. The purpose of religion is to ai=\r\nd in finding god. Unfortunately, no universal thumbrules can be given for f=\r\ninding god.

Therefore Islam forbids this idea.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; There is one id=\r\nea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Act=\r\nually as far as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by eg=\r\no. The entities which live by fire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They =\r\nare another class who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They =\r\nsupposedly carry information from earth to the heavens and use fire as a to=\r\nol for the same.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult p=\r\nractitioner use Jinns for different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exac=\r\nt correspondence to Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I k=\r\nnow people who do actually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Maybe=\r\n they are something like spirits or beings of some astral plane. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt; However, one who does Homa need for a=C3=82 deity need not worry a=\r\nbout these in the least. When a deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in pres=\r\nent, nothing else will dare interfere.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; But the real reason =\r\nwhy most muslims have an issue with fire is because in one Hadith it is men=\r\ntioned prophet Muhammed disliked fire because it reminded him of Hellfire. =\r\nFire to them is a symbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs=\r\n will be thrown by Allah into a huge fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; sadly in the vie=\r\nw of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different=\r\n directions or actually they try to make it such that they never meet.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Nai=\r\nk is correct. As I said he only lies and use half truths when it comes to o=\r\nther religion. For Islam he quotes correctly and wholesomely. The differenc=\r\ne between Islam and non Islamic ideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/ Jainis=\r\nm etc is irreconcileable.=C3=82 An explanation for this maybe digressing an=\r\nd long.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; But generally, if I were born in a muslim family, a=\r\nnd were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day out and trust the=\r\n Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as the perfected man, one =\r\nwhose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would consider Zakir Naik to be=\r\n 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamental that unless one is ready=\r\n to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there cannot be a reconciliation.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing the koran for 9 yea=\r\nrs.

That was a means of self preserva=\r\ntion which in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more =\r\nsublime path - IMHO -=C3=82 than that which comes from the Ahadiths and the=\r\n Koran proper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about something=\r\n similar to=C3=82 reincarnation in some of his poems while the following on=\r\ne does talk about communion with God:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I searched for Go=\r\nd among the Christians and on the Cross and therein I found Him not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but =\r\nGod I found not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With set purpose I fared to the summit of Mount Cauc=\r\nasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I directed my sear=\r\nch to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God was not there even.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from ibn Sina but found Him not=\r\n within his range.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I fared then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experie=\r\nnce of a great divine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from =\r\nhim&quot; but God was not there even in that exalted court.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, I loo=\r\nked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhamme=\r\nd. The creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else i=\r\ns Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my=\r\n interpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an =\r\nIslamic garb. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The person who changed the=\r\n life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=82 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalanan=\r\nda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was so powerful that he couil=\r\nd raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and asked him to de=\r\nmonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake =\r\nup!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. =\r\nFinally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediat=\r\ne the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone fo=\r\nr help other than Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for procla=\r\niming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. This statement is also=\r\n considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Auliya Niza=\r\nmuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India. It is said h=\r\ne had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva for a son before =\r\nShivaji was born.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally, except for the famous=C3=\r\n=82 Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis saint. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more subjective =\r\ninterpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never foo=\r\nled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do =\r\nnot blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell yo=\r\nu in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God c=\r\nommunion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ai=\r\nls Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional a=\r\nnd authentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, S=\r\nufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionab=\r\nly spiritual higher middle class. But like most things under the sun, they =\r\nhardly know anything about anything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of con=\r\nsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 19/11/09, ve=\r\ndic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedic_patha=\r\nk &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Poetry of Bulle Sha=\r\nh - Sufi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 19 =\r\nNovember, 2009, 5:21 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Some years back this specific poem of Baba=\r\n Bulle Shah - a sufi &gt;mystic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can you provid me knowledge of th=\r\nis Sufi sect. is it one of the branch from Islam?.
