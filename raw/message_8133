My thoughts are extremely foul...most speciall=\r\ny foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which means=\r\n I don&#39;t give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive me fr=\r\nom such pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love him. I =\r\nwant to pray him.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nCurrently, my mind and it&#39;s racing evil &amp; f=\r\noul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to keep me =\r\naway from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominated me =\r\nand I had to stay away from praying him for a while.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow my questi=\r\nons are&lt;br&gt;\nAm I a Maha papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nWhy does it happen to me?&lt;br&gt;\nIs it some kind of disorder&lt;br&gt;\nAm in incur=\r\nring wrath of god&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nI am scared to death that I am accumulating the=\r\n greatest sin enough for some 100 births&lt;br&gt;\nWhat can I do to get out of th=\r\nis perversion and be able to concentrate on him&lt;br&gt;\nI want to worship god l=\r\nike every one does&lt;br&gt;\nI am highly stressed because of this constant battle=\r\n.
