He got it =\r\nfrom some source and started giving Ahutis with the Mantra during his Maha-=\r\nGanapati Homam. As he has written, First day he had troubles in office and =\r\n2nd day his bike was stolen resulting in his shaken confidence due to obvio=\r\nus worries.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking at the situation, IMHO, it is very early to th=\r\nink about stopping the same. Though intentions for specifically invoking Mo=\r\nther Bagalamukhi is not known, I believe that it was for some or the other =\r\nSaatwik desire (Even it may have been mundane and not speeding up spiritual=\r\n progress). Also, it defies the logic to attach incidences to Homam with ex=\r\nperiences of just a couple of days.\n&gt; &gt; For that matter, even Maha-Ganapati=\r\n Homam was not easy if I take my own personal experiences. I have chiefly p=\r\nerformed Maha-Ganapati Homas as well as Chandi homas and I have had many se=\r\nt backs and some good things as well but again those are all part & parcel =\r\nof life. Even without Homam, one may experience such dualistic situations.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand your insistence and your prudent advice to worship So=\r\numya Devatas and I agree to your logic which is most probably out of your e=\r\nxperiences, however I also think that Ugra Devata should not be that fearfu=\r\nl while Soumya Devatas are not that Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all abou=\r\nt attraction/liking for a particular deity. It is my personal view that one=\r\n needs to decide upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Sou=\r\nmya in external Nature) to which one feels most attracted and then forget a=\r\nbout the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on mind of a person to st=\r\nart judging and relating day to day experiences with homam. The chosen deit=\r\ny can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any othe=\r\nr deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chosen deity, one is in saf=\r\ne hands. Even if things starts going wrong, one need not despair and should=\r\n keep faith till it is impossible because if God exist, there never would b=\r\ne a breaking point and that holds true for all of us whether we have famili=\r\nes to look after or not.\n&gt; &gt; I completely tend to agree and hence repeat fo=\r\nr benefits of others that Ganapati is not a Lower devata. He is capable of =\r\neverything. If one has a great liking for him, one can keep on performing h=\r\nis homam without need of switching. Actually to switch from Maha-Ganapati H=\r\nomam to some other deity is NOT changing of Levels (especially from Lower t=\r\no upper) which some may think.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The point raised by Biswajit is a genuine =\r\none.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress requires freedom from the burden of so=\r\nme key blocking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas. One way to be free from a karma is to experi=\r\nence the reaction to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it in full (in due course of time). Another way=\r\n is to burn it in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana. When one meditates or helps people or eng=\r\nages in various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual practices also, some karmas are getting bu=\r\nrnt and being taken \n&gt; &gt; &gt; off one&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like homam =\r\naccelerate that process. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam of ugra devatas accelerates it furthe=\r\nr. The distinction is between \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas and ugra devatas is a v=\r\nery important one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I gave this analogy a few times before. Sup=\r\npose there is a basket \n&gt; &gt; &gt; containing fruits (your karmas). Suppose a go=\r\nod fruit (good karma) is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck under some rotten fruits (bad karmas)=\r\n. When you do sadhana, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity (personification of certain good qu=\r\nalities within you, which are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being  strengthened as you do the sadh=\r\nana) re-arranges the kaarmik \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of the analogy, some=\r\n rotten fruits are taken out and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thrown in garbage and the good frui=\r\nt is given to you to eat. If this is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; done slowly and carefully, it t=\r\nakes longer to take the good fruit out, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but the spillage of rotten f=\r\nruit pieces on the floor is minimized. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the way of soumya dev=\r\natas (gentle deities). If this is done fast and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aggressively, the go=\r\nod fruit comes out faster, but the spillage of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruit pieces i=\r\ns more. This is the way of ugra devatas (fierce \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities). It is a tr=\r\nadeoff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I recommended befo=\r\nre, those who want their material life to go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smoothly and not in a h=\r\nurry for spiritual progress should stick to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas. Ganapath=\r\ni, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vishnu, Krishna etc can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be worshipped in fire=\r\n. Once one starts worshipping fierce forms like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi, Durga, Naras=\r\nimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, especially in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire, things CAN =\r\nbe too fast for them to handle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, it is a good idea to =\r\njust stick to Ganapathi homam for a few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, before starting to w=\r\norship any other deity. There is no need to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be in a hurry to &quot;gradua=\r\nte&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else. Ganapathi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is now lower and is c=\r\napable of giving everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMost people today do not understand Mahavidyas at all. For example, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbased on literal meanings of some scriptural sayings, they think that \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Bagalamukhi is for success over enemies and success in litigation etc. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Some people suggest specific Mahavidya sadhanas for material benefits =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on horoscopic combinations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vidya means knowledge=\r\n. Mahavidya means supreme knowledge. No knowledge \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that enables one t=\r\no win court cases or defeat enemies or to get other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary materi=\r\nal results can be termed as &quot;supreme&quot; knowledge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are far =\r\nmore serious. They stand for different aspects of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge of S=\r\nelf, which is the only supreme knowledge. They are the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; liberating fo=\r\nrms of the divine Mother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people on earth today are unrea=\r\ndy for their worship. People today \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need deities who can take care of=\r\n material things and give some push \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serious =\r\nliberating forces such as Mahavidyas are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inappropriate for one who w=\r\norries about little things. I mean no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disrespect - worrying about li=\r\nttle things is not unusual for most people \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and is ok - but then thin=\r\nk twice before worshipping Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; especially in a fruitful medi=\r\num such as fire. Fire amplifies the impact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the mantra and surroun=\r\nding thoughts on the subtle body and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accelerates the results, compar=\r\ned to normal meditation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cons=\r\nider the above words carefully and skip ugra devatas and Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n atleast for a while in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in the beginning,=\r\n some mistakes may be made. Just as Shiva drank \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the poison that came=\r\n out first during the churning of milky ocean, Guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gives protection=\r\n in the beginning. If you have a spiritual guru, think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of him/her be=\r\nfore the homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think of me or my guru D=\r\nr Manish Pandit. Better \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Swami (Shri Vasudev=\r\nananda Saraswati Maharaj), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Gulwani Maharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman =\r\nRao Dattatreya Gulwani), Shri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj and Manish Pandit. Tha=\r\nt is my Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, you can also think of Datta=\r\ntreya or Krishna or Shiva as your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru based on your inclination.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                    http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Fr=\r\ni, Mar 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM, biswa108 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     NAMASKAR\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, got the point... but my point is Whether I am ready for burni=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kermik debit with this kind of speed...
