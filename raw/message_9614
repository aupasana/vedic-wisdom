I am sure there too one=\r\n can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n\nI have very little k=\r\nnowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever t=\r\nried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n\nHowever, there is a particula=\r\nr mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency fo=\r\nr these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as =\r\nVatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one wh=\r\nose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in th=\r\ne Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhaira=\r\nva has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions f=\r\nor protection against spirits, and specially during rituals of cremation gr=\r\nound. \n\nThe standard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra to=\r\no, all are good):\n\n&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay=\r\n Hreem Om&quot;\n\nGenerally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in o=\r\nne sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time that there is=\r\n some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine =\r\ninstance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite imp=\r\nossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almo=\r\nst no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession fro=\r\nm a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the on=\r\ne trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will=\r\n have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Nar=\r\nasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess =\r\nbeing in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n\nIf the family visits I=\r\nndia, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kash=\r\ni and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once in=\r\nside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these =\r\ntwo temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adep=\r\nts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fe=\r\ne for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some sp=\r\necific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform =\r\ntheir rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I a=\r\nm sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n\n=\r\nHope this helps.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI have a hundred lives=\r\n before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with =\r\nheart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n=\r\n\n\n________________________________\n From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas=\r\n@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Saturday, 10 August 2013=\r\n 6:36 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits=\r\n (at nighttime)\n \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste.

For there are var=\r\nious classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individua=\r\nl and some of them can be downright nasty.\n\nUpayas are many. As so many dif=\r\nferent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, b=\r\nut whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not dep=\r\nends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. I=\r\nt all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individu=\r\nal and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find ou=\r\nt the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the=\r\n person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (whe=\r\nre this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and be=\r\ning susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body=\r\n, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm =\r\nto an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot on=\r\ne stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on =\r\nthe shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to hel=\r\np are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spiri=\r\nt of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tryi=\r\nng to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n\nThes=\r\ne things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall un=\r\nder the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting =\r\ninto, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. =\r\nEvery action has its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the =\r\nsame too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which=\r\n, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the indiv=\r\nidual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not =\r\nso pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It =\r\nis all a complex chain.\n\n[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some=\r\n years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism =\r\nhe would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time fr=\r\name for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmi=\r\nc link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals =\r\ndaily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promisin=\r\ng good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. =\r\nMost cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent =\r\nnature, force had to be applied.]\n\nBest thing to do is a) find someone\n who=\r\n knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b)=\r\n In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana=\r\n/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,pancham=\r\nukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with =\r\nsufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanum=\r\nan chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may h=\r\nave to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/=\r\nwill/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sad=\r\nhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possess=\r\ned individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard a=\r\ns possible. \n\nBest of luck and may God help the family.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Raj=\r\narshi\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O=\r\n spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a=\r\n hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n________________________________\n=\r\n From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17=\r\n AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at =\r\nnighttime)\n \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nThank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.=\r\n  I am amazed that mo one siggested any Hanuman related upayas.

I had trouble falling asleep, bec=\r\nause I could hear strange noises -  creaking and something moving in the at=\r\ntic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I=\r\n feel whether something divine or rather evil is present in a certain place=\r\n. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days=\r\n and every night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring a=\r\nt me - I could see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished.=\r\n Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day =\r\nI could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for m=\r\ny flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis =\r\nto me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can i=\r\nt be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few =\r\nmore people staying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sl=\r\neep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at =\r\nthat place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to =\r\nsleep properly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waki=\r\nng up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up=\r\n to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises=\r\n, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nIs there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at=\r\n night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bot=\r\nhering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank yo=\r\nu in advance!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \r\n--192144850-1267124424-1376158626=:11213\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Namaste S=\r\nir,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know about foreign countries. I am sure there too one ca=\r\nn find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have very littl=\r\ne knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never eve=\r\nr tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is a =\r\nparticular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent p=\r\notency for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, =\r\nknown as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as t=\r\nhe one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be fo=\r\nund in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This chi=\r\nld Bhairava has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor tra=\r\nditions for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cr=\r\nemation ground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations o=\r\nf this mantra too, all are good):&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aap=\r\nad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif=\r\n;&quot;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sittin=\r\ng. And this should be continued daily till such time that there is some vis=\r\nible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance =\r\nof spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible t=\r\no rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one=\r\n has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a dista=\r\nnce. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying =\r\nto help.&nbsp;So close family members, who live with the girl will\n have to=\r\n do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, =\r\nyou will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in=\r\n a foreign land homas may not be that easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the family visits Ind=\r\nia, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi =\r\nand then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once insi=\r\nde the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these tw=\r\no temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts=\r\n in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee =\r\nfor the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some spec=\r\nific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform th=\r\neir rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am =\r\nsure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Hope this\n helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: Verdana,=\r\nsans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roma=\r\nn, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNo=\r\nrmal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives be=\r\nfore me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, /&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will w=\r\nith heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri A=\r\nurobindo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_13424=\r\n3527249952\n yui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy=\r\n;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;=\r\n font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, t=\r\nimes, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/b&gt; &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 10 August 2013 =\r\n6:36 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/f=\r\nont&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1298363133&quot;&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div i=\r\nd=3D&quot;yiv1298363133ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste.

For there are various classes and kinds and=\r\n types of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be =\r\ndownright nasty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upayas are many. As so many different people have a=\r\ndvised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one o=\r\nf them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple fac=\r\ntors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on wha=\r\nt kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their li=\r\nnk for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or sourc=\r\ne of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes i=\r\nt can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) res=\r\nide), or\n causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to s=\r\nuch possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases w=\r\nhere such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ET=\r\nC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of rem=\r\noving and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the sp=\r\nirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to genera=\r\nte in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and e=\r\nxtremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is a=\r\nn adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These things like =\r\nremoving possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit =\r\nof normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadh=\r\naka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action h=\r\nas its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the same too. Agai=\r\nn\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on pre=\r\nvious karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then th=\r\nat too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant co=\r\nnsequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a compl=\r\nex chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years a=\r\ngo who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would=\r\n ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for =\r\nwhich the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link b=\r\netween the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to=\r\n entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good d=\r\needs for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cas=\r\nes it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, =\r\nforce had to be applied.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best thing to do is a) find someone\n who k=\r\nnows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) I=\r\nn the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/m=\r\nantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamuk=\r\nhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with su=\r\nfficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman=\r\n chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may hav=\r\ne to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/wi=\r\nll/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sadha=\r\nna keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possessed=\r\n individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as =\r\npossible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best of luck and may God help the family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york,\n times, serif;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1298363133MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv1298363133Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv1298363133Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv1298363133yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot;&gt;=\r\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, =\r\n/&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter thr=\r\nough them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new yor=\r\nk, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri Aurobindo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv1298363133yui_3_2=\r\n_0_2_134243506227946 yiv1298363133yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv1298363133=\r\nyui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY=\r\n:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace,\n sans-serif;font-size:12=\r\npt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;\nfo=\r\nnt-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Bhupendra Ja=\r\nmnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;=\r\n&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturda=\r\ny, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at n=\r\nighttime)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1298363133y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1298363133&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    =\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1298363133ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot;=\r\n cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because=\r\n I could hear strange noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic.=\r\n I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I fee=\r\nl whether something divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. Th=\r\nat place didn&#39;t feel good to me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was staying t=\r\nhere for 10 days and every night I would make up because of a feeling of so=\r\nmebody staring at me - I could see them but once I started focusing on them=\r\n, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing r=\r\napidly. One day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar.=\r\n I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thi=\r\ns doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware =\r\nand I can move my body.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits l=\r\nive in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying=\r\n at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not ju=\r\nst me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at=\r\n that place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to=\r\n sleep properly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that=\r\n place I started waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually =\r\nsome short beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though=\r\n); Once the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can slee=\r\np peacefully.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will prot=\r\nect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Something that I can chant=\r\n before going to sleep. This has been bothering me for some time now and it=\r\n interferes with my life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;\n         =\r\n                           &lt;/tr&gt;\n                                &lt;/tbody&gt;\n =\r\n                           &lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n            =\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;\n                =\r\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                                &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        =\r\n                    &lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/ht=\r\nml&gt;\r\n--192144850-1267124424-1376158626=:11213--\r\n\n"}}
