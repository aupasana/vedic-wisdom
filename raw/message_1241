But =\r\nany \nways, i apologize for the same. Why i said so because i have always \nh=\r\neard this from my elders. Also the many Sanskrit words in our \nregional lan=\r\nguages also add to that. but i know that is a \ncontroversial statement.\n\nRe=\r\ngarding Arabic Teacher - My Company organized classes for learning \nArabic =\r\nlanguage for interested employees. The teacher was a Lebanese \ncitizen. I d=\r\nidn&#39;t attend the class. One of my colleagues told me \nafterwards that One d=\r\nay during some relevant discussion, the teacher \nmade a comment that Basis =\r\nof Arabic Language is Sanskrit. Some \ncolleagues vehemently opposed that in=\r\n the class the matter ended  \nthere. That is what i was informed. I know no=\r\nthing more about why \nthe teacher said so.\n\n***\n\nVijay,\n\nYour views are not=\r\n out of place. I also thought that way but \nunfortunately the ambiguity in =\r\ntoday&#39;s available Sanskrit literature \nhave caused many confusions.\n\nWarm R=\r\negards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshm=\r\ni Narayana \nRao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to caution =\r\nourselves from getting into arguments \nwhether \n&gt; or not Sanskrit is mother=\r\n of all languages. One Arabic professor \n&gt; making such claim does not add m=\r\nuch credibility to the argument \nunless \n&gt; he has some compelling reasons t=\r\no make such statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; With in India, we find so called scholars argui=\r\nng that Sanskrit \ncame \n&gt; from other languages. You go south and will find =\r\nquite a few \nTamilians \n&gt; claim Sanskrit is not moth of Tamil.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would=\r\n definitely be interested to see why the Arabic professor \nfelt \n&gt; what he =\r\nfelt; how ever, the more important and basic question \nUtpal \n&gt; had is: Why=\r\n is the knowledge written down in such disputable \nmanner. \n&gt; Why it is not=\r\n written in simple words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal, your observation is true. For a long =\r\ntime the knowledge is \n&gt; passed on orally and there are quite a few corrupt=\r\nions in the \n&gt; scriptures as we have today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the scriptures hav=\r\ne redundancy built in to ensure the \n&gt; corruptions are checked to a large e=\r\nxtension.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming to the different meanings, it could be on purpose to =\r\nsome \n&gt; extent to ensure only the individuals with correct attitude has \nth=\r\ne \n&gt; intution to understand it. This could have been brought in by the \n&gt; p=\r\neople who passed on the knowledge as they were seeing India \ngetting \n&gt; inv=\r\naded.

I&#39;ve seen Scholars (Who are \n&gt; &gt; having knowled=\r\nge of Jyotisha as well as Sankrita) debating \nendlessly \n&gt; &gt; on a particula=\r\nr verse . one or two lines or sometimes even a \ncouple \n&gt; &gt; of words in a v=\r\nerse seems to create great confusions. we have \nseen \n&gt; &gt; that different sc=\r\nholars tend to interpret and derive different \n&gt; &gt; meaning from a same vers=\r\ne. i took the example of jyotish \nclassics \n&gt; &gt; because we are more familia=\r\nr with controversies in that area.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This confusion is also applicab=\r\nle in other literature of \nSanskrit \n&gt; &gt; language.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why Sanskrit (H=\r\neld as the finest language and mother of all the \n&gt; &gt; other language - One =\r\nArabic language teacher recently made a \nbold \n&gt; &gt; comment that basis of Ar=\r\nabic language is sanskrit) should create \nso \n&gt; &gt; much confusions among the=\r\n scholars. is it that ambiguous or the \n&gt; &gt; writers didn&#39;t wrote in a clutt=\r\ner-less fashion or the current \n&gt; &gt; generation is not sharp enough to grasp=\r\n the right meaning. \nWhatever \n&gt; &gt; may be the case, why a verse should fail=\r\n to give one a simple \n&gt; &gt; undisputable meaning at least literally like in =\r\nour modern \n&gt; languages?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
