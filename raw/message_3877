After all, many rishis=\r\n had wives!\n&gt;  \n&gt; If latent desires are there in the mind, remaining unmarr=\r\nied may not solve the problem but only postpone it. The goal of sadhana is =\r\nnot to &quot;pretend&quot; to be a liberated person or &quot;behave&quot; like a liberated pers=\r\non, but to &quot;become&quot; liberated.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Karmas and rinas are like a rope that =\r\nties a goat to a tree. The goat can move around in a limited space, dependi=\r\nng on the size of the rope, but cannot go beyond. Similarly, one has some f=\r\nree will but its scope depends on how serious (short) the karmas and rinas =\r\n(rope) are. What your rinas are, what scope your free will has and what is =\r\nthe best course of action for you, is to be determined by you. But, if that=\r\n is not clear at this time, do not think or analyze much now and go on with=\r\n life. Try to do your sadhana and surrender. Guidance regarding the directi=\r\non to take in this matter (as well as others) will come in time. When the l=\r\nogical mind and intuitive mind do not have enough information to decide a m=\r\natter wisely, it is better to wait (unless one is forced to decide it now).=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Namaste Aditi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Very good points. Forcible rep=\r\nression can boomerang as you said. Nor is free indulgence a feasible strate=\r\ngy, for there is no end to it. You put it very well: &quot;channeling healthily,=\r\n controlling, and then overcoming the desire&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your point regading un=\r\nilateral decision by a man or a woman is also good. However, this is a matt=\r\ner of tradeoff. When one has two options before one, one weighs them and ch=\r\nooses the better option. One may commit a bad karma in order to facilitate =\r\nanother good karma that is deemed bigger or more important. It is a matter =\r\nof a tradeoff and personal choice.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Swami Shivananda, whom Swami Vivek=\r\nananda used to call &quot;Mahapurush&quot; (great soul), did not touch his wife after=\r\n marriage and she died a broken person. Swami Yogananda was tricked into ma=\r\nrriage by his eager parents and he too uniliterally took up brahmacharya. H=\r\ne did not even go into the room for his first night. Such Swamis may have s=\r\nucceeded in offseting the bad karma with some other good karma they did to =\r\nthe affected souls or they may be paying back in the next lives. Both are p=\r\nossible.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- sayantan bose &lt;sayantan.bo=\r\nse@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Pranam Guruji,\n&gt; &gt; to all my seniors,\n&gt; &gt; and fellow ma=\r\ntes,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i have a simple quarry regarding this matter. since i am quit=\r\ne young and unmarried and i still have the opportunity to avoid marriage ..=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Q) so is it possible to avoid marriage by will or am i bound to m=\r\narry in case i have some karmic debts or rna bandhanas? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; since i b=\r\nelieve prevention is better than cure.. i am thinking in this way .. yes i =\r\nhave been maintaining celibacy for quite a long time .. and i do understand=\r\n that even a thought is karma.. now is there in anyways to avoid it in anyw=\r\nays by people like us who still have a chance.. or are we bound by our karm=\r\nas and rnas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i beg of mercy if i have said something wrong .. plea=\r\nse do correct me for any mistakes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; yours sincerely Sayantan,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; JAI MAA!\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; I notice =\r\nthis discussion has been mostly among men, many of whom appear to\n&gt; &gt; be ma=\r\nrried. I would like to point out that brahmacharya should not be taken\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nas a unilateral decision and that the wife&#39;s sexual needs also be honored\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and respected (whether verbally articulated or not). Even Ramakrishna\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; offered Sarada that he would give up his sexual abstinence in order to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; fulfill his husbandly dharma towards her. Grhastha dharma in many of our\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; scriptures enjoins certain restrictions upon sexual behavior (e.g., not=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; during Ekadasi or other certain days, or so many days after a woman&#39;s =\r\nmenses\n&gt; &gt; has ended, etc.), which are short of extended periods of sexual =\r\ncelibacy but\n&gt; &gt; nevertheless accomplish the same ends (gradually, over tim=\r\ne) of channeling\n&gt; &gt; healthily, controlling, and then overcoming the desire=\r\n for sex. Also,\n&gt; &gt; forcible repression can have the opposite effet--flarin=\r\ng up of strong sexual\n&gt; &gt; urges that can be more problematic later on if he=\r\nalthy release is not\n&gt; &gt; allowed. A lot of problems in the Catholic church,=\r\n ISKCON and now BAPS are\n&gt; &gt; attributable to this.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
