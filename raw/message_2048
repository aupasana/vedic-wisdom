For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s chart has Sun (Raama/Maatangi=\r\n\n&gt; in general opinion) in 12th from Atma Karaka in navamsa and Jupiter\n&gt; (V=\r\naamana/Taaraa) owns it. A highly learned astrologer once argued with me\n&gt; p=\r\nublicly that Lord Rama and Taaraa were Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s ishta\n&gt; de=\r\nvatas and not Kaali and tried to justify that. Well, if Ramakrishna\n&gt; Param=\r\nahamsa comes to you and the thumb rules you use do not show Kaali as\n&gt; isht=\r\na devata for him, the rules you are using have something missing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus,=\r\n horoscopic thumb rules are not reliable. However, the vibrations you\n&gt; fee=\r\nl when chanting different mantras and visiting different temples can be\n&gt; u=\r\nseful clues.

As per my chart (26/2/73,\n&gt; 17:07, 87E19,23N29, Leo Lagna) an=\r\nd my brief study of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta\n&gt; will be Shiva(Sun), Palan dev=\r\nta is Samba siva (have not heard much about\n&gt; him) and Guru Devta is Skanad=\r\na.\n&gt;\n&gt; Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME of shiva=\r\n and\n&gt; ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It&#39;s a difficult to describe feel=\r\ning\n&gt; - it&#39;s as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surrounding me. Recently=\r\n, I\n&gt; went to a shani( w/Hanuman & Ganesha) temple, and it also seemed to h=\r\nave\n&gt; good vibration to me. How do I reconcile these facts on choosing the =\r\nhomam?\n&gt; Is it just the play of my mind to be ignored , or divine intervent=\r\nion to be\n&gt; interpreted.\n&gt; Or\n&gt; if Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting poin=\r\nt before we go ahead with any\n&gt; effort at reconciliation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks & Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt;\n&gt; Sanjay\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 8:29 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

It i=\r\ns fine to work hard like a honeybee, be engrossed in\n&gt;&gt; material life and f=\r\neel many happinesses and sadnesses of life. The only\n&gt;&gt; thing missed out is=\r\n self-realization and moksha.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (b) Not exactly. Spiritual progress doe=\r\ns not mean shunning material\n&gt;&gt; things. Some people leave wife, children, h=\r\nouse, car etc and live in forest,\n&gt;&gt; in an attempt to get control over the =\r\nmind and remove the attachment to and\n&gt;&gt; dependency on those things. Howeve=\r\nr, it is not necessary. One can remove the\n&gt;&gt; dependency on all things that=\r\n surround one, even as one remains in their\n&gt;&gt; middle! Staying away from so=\r\nmething is neither necessary nor sufficient to\n&gt;&gt; overcome attachment. What=\r\n things and people are around you and what actions\n&gt;&gt; you engage in are *no=\r\nt *the problem that blocks you from moksha. It is\n&gt;&gt; how *you* look at them=\r\n and with what frame of mind *you *engage in the\n&gt;&gt; actions that are the bl=\r\nockages. So the problem is not the material world\n&gt;&gt; around you, but *your =\r\nown mind* that is the problem. Detachment does not\n&gt;&gt; mean not loving or no=\r\nt engaging in actions. Detachment means loving but\n&gt;&gt; without expectations =\r\nand engaging in actions but without expectations.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you give love an=\r\nd do not expect anything in return, if you put in your\n&gt;&gt; best effort towar=\r\nds what you see as your dharma for people around you and do\n&gt;&gt; not worry ab=\r\nout things that go wrong, if you focus on the present and engage\n&gt;&gt; in the =\r\nbest possible actions without too much of worry or anxiety about past\n&gt;&gt; or=\r\n future, can there be anything more effective or efficient than that?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n If one is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf and engages in actions\n&gt;&gt; w=\r\nithout attachment, one is not necessarily a failure materially. Such a\n&gt;&gt; p=\r\nerson will do *everything *a person with deep attachments does, but only\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n better! I say better, because a detached person does not waste time worryi=\r\nng\n&gt;&gt; about things out of one&#39;s hand or things that went wrong. A detached =\r\nperson\n&gt;&gt; always focuses on the best action to engage in *right now *and do=\r\nes it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment does not make you =\r\nmore\n&gt;&gt; effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment makes you =\r\nless\n&gt;&gt; effective and efficient. If you are detached, you will give uncondi=\r\ntionally\n&gt;&gt; and engage in actions without any energy being dispersed on wor=\r\nrying over\n&gt;&gt; things out of your control. Normal people waste a lot of thei=\r\nr time, energy\n&gt;&gt; and emotional space, worrying about things they cannot co=\r\nntrol. A detached\n&gt;&gt; person does what is in one&#39;s control perfectly and acc=\r\nepts the result\n&gt;&gt; whole-heartedly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you=\r\n will do everything you see as your\n&gt;&gt; dharma, but only better. You will no=\r\nt feel happy or sad or jealous and angry\n&gt;&gt; etc. Your mind will be in a sta=\r\nble, peaceful and blissful state always. It\n&gt;&gt; is worth it. You are not get=\r\nting out of anything, but putting in the best\n&gt;&gt; effort.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (e) Yes, do =\r\nnot think of emancipation or liberation. Think one small step\n&gt;&gt; at a time.=\r\n Think of getting some physical and mental discipline. Think of\n&gt;&gt; some min=\r\nor control over mind. Thinking overcoming minor weaknesses. Start\n&gt;&gt; slowly=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (f) There are many ways. The specific way using which many people w=\r\nill\n&gt;&gt; benefit in the next few centuries and the specific way which I am he=\r\nre to\n&gt;&gt; teach is &quot;homam&quot; or fire ritual. When you are with a person, the p=\r\nhysical\n&gt;&gt; vibrations made by the person&#39;s lips can be heard physically by =\r\nyour ears.\n&gt;&gt; Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle body and mind ca=\r\nn be &quot;heard&quot; by\n&gt;&gt; your subtle body and mind. That is why we feel pleasant =\r\nwhen we are with\n&gt;&gt; great saints and uneasy in some companies. The vibratio=\r\nns produced by the\n&gt;&gt; subtle and causal bodies of people around us do have =\r\nan impact on us. Fire\n&gt;&gt; is one powerful object which has very pleasant, po=\r\nwerful and cleansing\n&gt;&gt; vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being n=\r\next to fire of a\n&gt;&gt; reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nIf one does a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2-3 years, things\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; will automatically start to fall in place.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The problem you are see=\r\nking is your mind. The solution is also in your\n&gt;&gt; mind. You use your mind =\r\nto train mind to let go of its weaknesses and\n&gt;&gt; attachments one by one.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;http://www.vedicastrolog=\r\ner.org/tarpana&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedic=\r\nastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org&lt;http://www.srijagannath.org/&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;&gt; *Fr=\r\nom:* Sanjay Prasad &lt;skprasad@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom\n&gt;&gt; *Sent:* Wednesday, June 24, 2009 6:17 AM\n&gt;&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Re: Descent of the Supramenal\n&gt;&gt; Conscinousness\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Very good article/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I can, =\r\nLet me also ask some basic questions. (I am very new to all\n&gt;&gt; this. Search=\r\n for some answers has brought me to this forum.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a) Why Madhukaitam i=\r\ns  so bad/evil? Is it not that the world is being\n&gt;&gt; sustained by people ke=\r\neping their head down and doing the routine work? Do\n&gt;&gt; we not please the G=\r\nod by keeping our head down and playing the role assigned\n&gt;&gt; to us ? An obv=\r\nious answer comes to mind is that it will keep us away from\n&gt;&gt; emancipation=\r\n and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; b) So,  Is spirituality a=\r\nnd materialism two poles apart (and twain shall\n&gt;&gt; never meet..). Say I wd =\r\nlike to reach the heights of professional success in\n&gt;&gt; my career, Am I doo=\r\nmed not to become a good spiritualist (???)? or, If I\n&gt;&gt; want to become sel=\r\nf-actualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop planning\n&gt;&gt; to climb the p=\r\nrofessional ladder? I do understand about &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot;\n&gt;&gt; issue - bu=\r\nt, then I also read about King Janak. Can I combine these two - if\n&gt;&gt; yes, =\r\nhow?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  c) Getting even more confused now,  Why do we say that emancipa=\r\ntion is\n&gt;&gt; our spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage =\r\n- should our\n&gt;&gt; goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us =\r\nto play. By\n&gt;&gt; seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off the stage=\r\n and trying to\n&gt;&gt; escape the role assigned to us. Are we not contradicting =\r\nthe God&#39;s scheme of\n&gt;&gt; things by trying to get out of the scheme?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; d) =\r\nOr, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and then\n&gt;&gt; a=\r\nsk us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; playing &quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; e) Sometimes, I also=\r\n think that all these above questions are meaningless.\n&gt;&gt; I look at my pre-=\r\nschool kid and the way she has put her faith in her\n&gt;&gt; teacher. She is not =\r\nworrying about her profession or phd thesis right now.\n&gt;&gt; Similarly, probab=\r\nly, Emancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems\n&gt;&gt; that we should n=\r\not be thinking at the begining of our spiritual journey -\n&gt;&gt; just look to l=\r\nearn/experience more till we are ready (for what?)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; f) Then, what do w=\r\ne mean by spiritual journey? where/how do we start? I\n&gt;&gt; thought about doin=\r\ng homam/reciting mantra - but is that the right way? or\n&gt;&gt; there is another=\r\n way. Probably, there are many ways - then how do I choose\n&gt;&gt; my way? An &quot;u=\r\nser guide&quot; or &quot; spirituality for dummies&quot; book  would have been\n&gt;&gt; useful. =\r\nDo we have one?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will appreciate if you can take some time out to gu=\r\nide me here. In fact,\n&gt;&gt; probably, I donot even have the right question rig=\r\nht now - forget about\n&gt;&gt; articulating them well and seeking the answer (I a=\r\nm seeking the problem :))\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sanjay\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 24, =\r\n2009 at 9:12 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

As per Narayana sooktam, all gods (including Brahma,\n&gt;&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, =\r\nIndra etc) came from Narayana. As per Ganapathi Atharva\n&gt;&gt; seersham, all go=\r\nds (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from\n&gt;&gt; Ganapathi. As =\r\nper Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including Brahma,\n&gt;&gt; Vishnu, Shiv=\r\na, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi. As per Suryopanishat, all\n&gt;&gt; gods (inclu=\r\nding Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Surya. And so\n&gt;&gt; on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n The duality is so vast and yet non-duality is the underlying supreme\n&gt;&gt; re=\r\nality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy within hierarchy will have to start\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; at the connection with non-duality and it is not one. In other words, any=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; hierarchy given by anyone is with respect to one perspective. I will no=\r\nt be\n&gt;&gt; too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, because that cannot be done r=\r\neally. If\n&gt;&gt; you haven&#39;t before, do read the analogy in the last part of th=\r\ne mail\n&gt;&gt; mentioned above. It is an analogy worth getting into your thinkin=\r\ng system.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I mean is it the Rishi who is a=\r\ncting our the Mother&#39;s instructions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or is it She who is creating the e=\r\nnvironment for the Rishi&#39;s wish\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to come true? Which one came first?\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; There is no causal relationship between the two. Actions of rishis and =\r\nthe\n&gt;&gt; will of the supreme cosmic being are in sync. They just happen toget=\r\nher.\n&gt;&gt; Neither causes the other.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rishis are the most perfected being=\r\ns without a trace of ego and yet\n&gt;&gt; performing actions of great consequence=\r\n, with zero attachment. They operate\n&gt;&gt; right on the border of duality and =\r\nnon-duality.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &gt; As a devotee it is natural =\r\nand simple to believe that the God I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pray to is the Ultimate Supreme a=\r\nuthority, but when I hear that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rishis are even beyond this, then doubt=\r\n creeps in, is the deity\n&gt;&gt; &gt; therefore not as supreme as is made out to be=\r\n?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana. Sometimes, one&#39;s belief =\r\nthat\n&gt;&gt; one&#39;s guru is the best guru or the god one prays to is the supreme =\r\none is\n&gt;&gt; rooted in one&#39;e ego and one&#39;s need to be the best and be associat=\r\ned with the\n&gt;&gt; best.

Also, he need not=\r\n be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his\n&gt;&gt; ashram. Moreover, when it =\r\ncomes to great lineages, there are connections\n&gt;&gt; between all. For example,=\r\n Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister\n&gt;&gt; Nivedita, the foremost disc=\r\niple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when\n&gt;&gt; he still lived in Calcu=\r\ntta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami\n&gt;&gt; Vivekananda, just a few=\r\n years after his death, in which he imparted\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo some key knowledg=\r\ne. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and\n&gt;&gt; learnt Sanskrit from M,=\r\n who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel\n&gt;&gt; of Ramakrishna. Tr=\r\nilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to\n&gt;&gt; expand his knowledg=\r\ne. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him.\n&gt;&gt; And so on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Coming back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying =\r\nsome\n&gt;&gt; attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in=\r\n one of\n&gt;&gt; the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes o=\r\nn earth by\n&gt;&gt; the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to m=\r\nake some\n&gt;&gt; positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play=\r\n, he may\n&gt;&gt; focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and=\r\n direct a few\n&gt;&gt; important souls to do some key work. Some important souls =\r\n(deities,\n&gt;&gt; rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) t=\r\no be born on\n&gt;&gt; earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You=\r\n may then see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened\n&gt;&gt; beings=\r\n and realized beings born on earth to bring clarity in different\n&gt;&gt; aspects=\r\n of spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get specific\n&gt;&gt; internal/externa=\r\nl guidance from the divine, based on what their part in the\n&gt;&gt; play is.\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  The &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that Aurobindo allud=\r\ned to is all around us. At\n&gt;&gt; the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego=\r\n in pretty much everybody. At\n&gt;&gt; the grossest level, he manifests as blatan=\r\nt lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One should not tolerate this Asura (dem=\r\non) and fight hard. However, one\n&gt;&gt; should not *hate* this Asura or those a=\r\nfflicted by him. When we encounter\n&gt;&gt; lies, we should fight and stand for t=\r\nruth but not hate the liar at the same\n&gt;&gt; time. There is nothing that needs=\r\n to be hated in this world. One should\n&gt;&gt; learn to do the job assigned to o=\r\nne by Nature without attraction or\n&gt;&gt; repulsion to anything or anybody and =\r\nwith unconditional love (i.e. no\n&gt;&gt; expectations of a return) to all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n&gt;&gt; &gt; says =\r\nabout changes coming in the world.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know very little.

I am\n&gt;&gt; posting it here for anyone interested.\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Near the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not bee=\r\nn\n&gt;&gt; expressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the t=\r\nime\n&gt;&gt; had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that th=\r\ne divine\n&gt;&gt; was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this =\r\ndivine\n&gt;&gt; emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending =\r\nto Earth,\n&gt;&gt; even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic res=\r\nistance held\n&gt;&gt; within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=\r\n=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a=\r\n French mystic, Mirra\n&gt;&gt; Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Tog=\r\nether they embarked on a\n&gt;&gt; journey of intensive cellular transformation th=\r\nat is very relevant to the\n&gt;&gt; colossal uncertainties we face today.\n&gt;&gt; =EF=\r\n=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and=\r\n that all\n&gt;&gt; matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of =\r\nthe divine\n&gt;&gt; spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The =\r\nprocess by\n&gt;&gt; which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called=\r\n evolution.\n&gt;&gt; According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage whe=\r\nre these two\n&gt;&gt; events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visio=\r\nns, he foresaw\n&gt;&gt; that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he c=\r\nalled =EF=BF=BDsupramental\n&gt;&gt; (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that woul=\r\nd entirely change everything on Earth.\n&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; Man=EF=BF=BDs greatn=\r\ness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he\n&gt;&gt; makes possi=\r\nble. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom\n&gt;&gt; active in =\r\nmost people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if\n&gt;&gt; obstructed=\r\n from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality.\n&gt;&gt; There is a=\r\n great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer\n&gt;&gt; senses s=\r\neems to contradict it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is goi=\r\nng through an evolutionary\n&gt;&gt; crisis. A stage has been reached in which the=\r\n human mind has made tremendous\n&gt;&gt; strides on the one hand, but is left hop=\r\nelessly inadequate to prevent its\n&gt;&gt; own extinction as a species. Meanwhile=\r\n, as the Mother testified before her\n&gt;&gt; death in 1973, a consciousness high=\r\ner than the human rational mind, what may\n&gt;&gt; be termed the Supermind, has r=\r\necently been established in the fields of the\n&gt;&gt; Earth, and is active there=\r\n. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular\n&gt;&gt; consciousness.\n&gt;&gt; Evolu=\r\ntion took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later\n&gt;&gt; with =\r\nthe emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap\n&gt;&gt; forwa=\r\nrd, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the\n&gt;&gt; Supermin=\r\nd. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which\n&gt;&gt; we w=\r\nill soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being poss=\r\nessing an\n&gt;&gt; individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting an=\r\nd merging with\n&gt;&gt; it.\n&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to\n&gt;&gt; birth under the influ=\r\nence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being\n&gt;&gt; that is largely abl=\r\ne to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than\n&gt;&gt; mind-consciousne=\r\nss.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit =\r\na dense physical body,\n&gt;&gt; but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, w=\r\nhich is supramental\n&gt;&gt; consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular =\r\nconsciousness.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=\r\n=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; divinity incarnated fully within the subt=\r\nle realms of matter. This will be a\n&gt;&gt; race of what we could call =EF=BF=BD=\r\nDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity\n&gt;&gt; of matter and spi=\r\nrit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n&gt;&gt; The great work of Sri Aurobindo =\r\nand the Mother was in bringing supramental\n&gt;&gt; consciousness down into the c=\r\nellular consciousness of their own bodies.\n&gt;&gt; Since this is a unified consc=\r\niousness, this meant that the supramental\n&gt;&gt; consciousness was simultaneous=\r\nly being brought into the consciousness fields\n&gt;&gt; of the Earth, awaiting th=\r\ne moment when it would flower into its full\n&gt;&gt; manifestation in collective =\r\nmatter.\n&gt;&gt; Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is correspon=\r\nding resistance. Sri\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience =\r\nwith the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD\n&gt;&gt; essentially anti-divine forces, =\r\nat work in the world today. There is the\n&gt;&gt; Asura of Darkness, the Asura of=\r\n Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the\n&gt;&gt; Asura of Death. These are th=\r\ne forces that are so outwardly apparent, and\n&gt;&gt; which seem to be in control=\r\n of current global events. According to them the\n&gt;&gt; Asura of Darkness (Luci=\r\nfer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and\n&gt;&gt; the Asura of Suffe=\r\nring has returned to Source, and so only the latter two\n&gt;&gt; still remain to =\r\nwreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura\n&gt;&gt; of Falsehoo=\r\nd =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of t=\r\nheir\n&gt;&gt; own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not =\r\nbe\n&gt;&gt; difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world l=\r\neaders\n&gt;&gt; in the current political sphere.\n&gt;&gt; With the descent of this new =\r\nvibratory consciousness all our old obsolete\n&gt;&gt; human structures will be de=\r\nmolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that\n&gt;&gt; although the changes wi=\r\nll be enormous they would not be necessarily\n&gt;&gt; catastrophic. The power of =\r\nTruth automatically erases Falsehood, and our\n&gt;&gt; world for the most part co=\r\nnsists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he\n&gt;&gt; maintained, carried a powe=\r\nr of harmonization which could overcome this\n&gt;&gt; resistance by means other t=\r\nhan dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras\n&gt;&gt; will eventually be absorb=\r\ned into their original emanations of Light, Life,\n&gt;&gt; Beauty, and Truth. It =\r\nmay be interesting to speculate, with all the violence\n&gt;&gt; in the world toda=\r\ny, the destruction we might have experienced if not for\n&gt;&gt; this power of ha=\r\nrmonization!\n&gt;&gt; *When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother be=\r\nlieved that\n&gt;&gt; the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that i=\r\nt was quite\n&gt;&gt; imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental trans=\r\nformation was a\n&gt;&gt; certainty now, and that it would come about with a minim=\r\num of destruction,\n&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=\r\n=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000\n&gt;&gt; would be a turning point.*\n&gt;&gt; **\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; changes coming in the world.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Regards\n&gt;&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * The ups=\r\nurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;&gt; *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd20d86d23a35046d2a638f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Thanks a ton...It helps a lot.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 4:22 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

A highly learned astrologer once argued wi=\r\nth me publicly that Lord Rama and Taaraa were Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s=\r\n ishta devatas and not Kaali and tried to justify that. Well, if Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa comes to you and the thumb rules you use do not show Kaali as=\r\n ishta devata for him, the rules you are using have something missing.&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Thus, horoscopic thumb rules are not reliable.=\r\n However, the vibrations you feel when chanting different mantras and visit=\r\ning different temples can be useful clues.

It =\r\nis fine to work hard like a honeybee, be engrossed in material life and fee=\r\nl many happinesses and sadnesses of life. The only thing missed out is self=\r\n-realization and moksha.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;(b) Not exactly. =\r\nSpiritual progress does not mean shunning material things. Some people leav=\r\ne wife, children, house, car etc and live in forest, in an attempt to get c=\r\nontrol over the mind and remove the attachment to and dependency on those t=\r\nhings. However, it is not necessary. One can remove the dependency on all t=\r\nhings that surround one, even as one remains in their middle! Staying away =\r\nfrom something is neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment.=\r\n=C2=A0What things and people are around you and what actions you engage in =\r\nare &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;the problem that blocks you from moksha. It is how &lt;em&gt;you=\r\n&lt;/em&gt; look at them and with what frame of mind &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;engage in the a=\r\nctions that are the blockages. So the problem is not the material world aro=\r\nund you, but &lt;em&gt;your own mind&lt;/em&gt; that is the problem. Detachment does no=\r\nt mean not loving or not engaging in actions. Detachment means loving but w=\r\nithout expectations and engaging in actions but without expectations.&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If you give love and do not expect anything in =\r\nreturn, if you put in your best effort towards what you see as your dharma =\r\nfor people around you and do not worry about things that go wrong, if you f=\r\nocus on the present and engage in the best possible actions without too muc=\r\nh of worry or anxiety about past or future, can there be anything more effe=\r\nctive or efficient than that?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If one is l=\r\nike a drop of water on a lotus leaf and engages in actions without attachme=\r\nnt, one is not necessarily a failure materially. Such a person will do &lt;em&gt;=\r\neverything &lt;/em&gt;a person with deep attachments does, but only better! I say=\r\n better, because a detached person does not waste time worrying about thing=\r\ns out of one&#39;s hand or things that went wrong. A detached person always=\r\n focuses on the best action to engage in &lt;em&gt;right now &lt;/em&gt;and does it.&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment =\r\ndoes not make you more effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, attach=\r\nment makes you less effective and efficient. If you are detached, you will =\r\ngive unconditionally and engage in actions without any energy being dispers=\r\ned on worrying over things out of your control. Normal people waste a lot o=\r\nf their time, energy and emotional space, worrying about things they cannot=\r\n control. A detached person does what is in one&#39;s control perfectly and=\r\n accepts the result whole-heartedly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;(c) I=\r\nf you are a jeevanmukta, you will do everything you see as your dharma, but=\r\n only better. You will not feel happy or sad or jealous and angry etc. Your=\r\n mind will be in a stable, peaceful and blissful state always. It is worth =\r\nit. You are not getting out of anything, but putting in the best effort.&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;(e)=C2=A0Yes, do not think of emancipation o=\r\nr liberation.

The specific way using which many people will =\r\nbenefit in the next few centuries and the specific way which I am here to t=\r\neach is &quot;homam&quot; or fire ritual. When you are with a person, the p=\r\nhysical vibrations made by the person&#39;s lips can be heard physically by=\r\n your ears. Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle body and mind can =\r\nbe &quot;heard&quot; by your subtle body and mind. That is why we feel plea=\r\nsant when we are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. The vibrat=\r\nions produced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us do have a=\r\nn impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very pleasant, powerf=\r\nul and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being next to =\r\nfire of a reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If one does a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2=\r\n-3 years, things will automatically start to fall in place.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;The problem you are seeking is your mind.

(I am=\r\n very new to all this.

Is it not that the world is being sus=\r\ntained by people keeping their head down and doing the routine work? Do we =\r\nnot please the God by keeping our head down and playing the role assigned t=\r\no us ? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep us away from em=\r\nancipation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;b) So,=C2=A0 Is spirituali=\r\nty and materialism two poles apart (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd=\r\n like to reach the heights of professional success in my career, Am I doome=\r\nd not to become a good spiritualist (???)? or, If I want to become self-act=\r\nualized by 2025, does it mean I should stop planning to climb the professio=\r\nnal ladder? I do understand about &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot; issue - but=\r\n, then I also read about King Janak. Can I combine these two - if yes, how?=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;c) Getting even more confused now,=C2=A0 Why do we say that emancipation i=\r\ns our=C2=A0spiritual goal. If GOD created us, and put us on this stage - sh=\r\nould our goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God wants us to play=\r\n. By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off the stage and tryin=\r\ng to escape the role assigned to us. Are we not contradicting the God&#39;s=\r\n scheme of things by trying to get out of the scheme? &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;d) Or, Is it part of God&#=\r\n39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and then ask us to get=\r\n out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will not be p=\r\nlaying=C2=A0&quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;e) Sometimes, I also t=\r\nhink that all these above questions are meaningless. I look at my pre-schoo=\r\nl kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She is not worrying=\r\n about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, probably,=C2=A0Em=\r\nancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should not be thi=\r\nnking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to learn/experie=\r\nnce more till we are ready (for what?)&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual jour=\r\nney? where/how do we start? I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra - b=\r\nut is that the right way? or there is another way. Probably, there are many=\r\n ways - then how do I choose my way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or &quot; sp=\r\nirituality for dummies&quot; book=C2=A0 would have been useful.

Also, he need no=\r\nt be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, =\r\nwhen it comes to great lineages, there are connections between all. For exa=\r\nmple, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost di=\r\nsciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcut=\r\nta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just=C2=A0a fe=\r\nw years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge.=\r\n Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who =\r\nwas a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga S=\r\nwami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga=\r\n Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him.

A maharshi absorbed in the di=\r\nvine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge chang=\r\nes on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to =\r\nmake some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, =\r\nhe may focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and dire=\r\nct a few important souls to do some key work.=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Ari=\r\nal&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send=\r\n their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfil different par=\r\nts of a divine play.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;You may then see seve=\r\nral (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings =\r\nborn on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge.=\r\n Each of them will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine,=\r\n based on what their part in the play is.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;=\r\nArial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;The &quot;Asura of Fal=\r\nsehood&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us.
