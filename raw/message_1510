I am amongst the many clamoring for a manual to conduct the Satya N=\r\narayana vratam. However, I&#39;m curious as to the tradition of homam accompany=\r\ning the Satya Narayana vratam ritual. It seems the custom of a homam after =\r\nthe puja is well established in the eastern part of the country (India). Bu=\r\nt many a priest of south indian origin from the local Balaji temple here ha=\r\ns looked askance at me when I have asked about the homam after the puja. No=\r\nne of them are aware of it. After some discussions we finally reached a con=\r\nclusion that it is probably a cultural variance unique to the eastern and p=\r\nrobably northern regions of the country. I am curious as to what do you per=\r\nsonally do after your Satyanarayana Vratam. And what is the origin of the c=\r\nustom of Homan accompanying the puja?\n\nWarmest Regards,\nAlok.\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

With His blessings, it s=\r\nhould happen this year.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am glad you are performing Mahalakshmi homa=\r\nm.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, another gentleman called Arnab has been asking for some mantr=\r\nas for the brihat procedure.
