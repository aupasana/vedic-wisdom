I am still working on\n&gt; it. The &quot;regular&quot; version will most probab=\r\nly take a few more weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; The purpose of this upload is to get feedbac=\r\nk and also make it available\n&gt; to anyone who wants to peruse it for the com=\r\ning Full Moon. They will\n&gt; have a couple of days to go through it and prepa=\r\nre.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once these are ready, versions with mantras written in Telugu, Kan=\r\nnada,\n&gt; Gujarati etc will be prepared. That will take a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the =\r\nnext few months, homam and fire yoga manuals will also be\n&gt; re-edited and s=\r\ntreamlined.
