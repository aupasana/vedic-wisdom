Infact, there are some very old manusc=\r\nripts that pass on through generations of the main priests of the Temple, w=\r\nhich also shed some light on this fact. It is from one of that manuscripts =\r\nit was found that the Temple was orginally built as a Bhairava Temple with =\r\nthe pradhan deities being Mahakali, Tara and Bhuvaneshwari. The whole area =\r\nof the temple was designed as=A0a Bhairavi Chakra, that is why the prasad o=\r\nf Puri is called Mahaprasad - beyond all rules (even one who is fasting can=\r\n have the prasad of Puri).\n=A0\nTo clarify, my mail was not at all a critici=\r\nsm of the man that Swamiji was. Without the slightest iota of doubt, he sin=\r\ngle handedly achieved what it would have taken a crowd of average calibre m=\r\nen thousands of years. He was a leader of men. And about his spiritual cali=\r\nbre, there is no question either. Thakur had himself certified Swamji, and =\r\nThakur&#39;s words on spirituality are like Gospel truths for me.\n=A0\nHowever, =\r\nwhen it comes to judging/understanding material aspects of knowledge, it is=\r\n always a changing reality, therefore best is to keep oneself updated.

Give the benefit =\r\nof doubt and try to understand &lt;BR&gt;respectfully.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, when it =\r\ncomes to factual inaccuracies, it is a different matter. &lt;BR&gt;If you know fo=\r\nr sure that something a spiritual giant said was a factual\n &lt;BR&gt;inaccuracy,=\r\n you can of course dismiss and ignore it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An active man like Vivekan=\r\nanda, who accomplished so much in a life of 39 &lt;BR&gt;years, may sometimes use=\r\n wrong facts at his disposal based on the &lt;BR&gt;understanding at his time, to=\r\n advocate what he wanted to advocate. But, &lt;BR&gt;blessed jnaanis and karma yo=\r\ngis like Vivekananda or Aurobindo would often &lt;BR&gt;end up advocating correct=\r\n views even if they use wrong facts occasionally to &lt;BR&gt;support their views=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I am not mistakened, the current temple at Puri was built aroun=\r\nd 1000 AD &lt;BR&gt;or so.
