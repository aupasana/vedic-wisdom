I tried listening to Narasimha&#39;s mp3, but found it a b=\r\nit fast for my liking.\n\nIt is important for beginners, to know how to chant=\r\n in a rhythm, the sandhi&#39;s and especially some complicated words.\n\nHope thi=\r\ns helps.\n\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayan=\r\na_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; When I started out to d=\r\no Chandi Homam, it took me 4Hrs to perform it.
