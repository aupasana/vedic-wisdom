The vibrations produced by the subtle body are far more i=\r\nmportant than the vibrations produced by the gross body. Thus, mantra is mo=\r\nre of a subtle body activity than a gross body activity. Thus, purity and c=\r\nleanliness of the subtle body is more important than that of gross body. Ho=\r\nwever, people cannot perceive the subtle body and its purity. Maintaining t=\r\nhe purity of subtle body and mind is far more difficult than taking bath, w=\r\nearing clean clothes and being in pleasant surroundings. Thus, people shoot=\r\n for the easier external thing (which is a symbol), in the hope that it eve=\r\nntually brings the desired internal end result. If one takes bath, wears cl=\r\nean clothes, keeps one&#39;s surroundings clean and pleasant, it will make the =\r\nmind feel clean. It eventually can bring purity to the mind. Thus, even whi=\r\nle maintaining external purity, remember that what matters is the internal =\r\npurity and that external purity is being maintained only to promote interna=\r\nl purity in the long run.\n \nLet me now answer your specific question. Pleas=\r\ne remember that the goal of the external practices is to bring forth the de=\r\nsired internal transformation. If there is any amount of guilt or fear or f=\r\neeling of impurity in the mind when chanting something without taking bath,=\r\n it is disruptive. These feelings slow down internal transformation. Then i=\r\nt is a good idea to take bath or do whatever is needed to remove those disr=\r\nuptive feelings. On the other hand, if one feels peaceful, clean and calm i=\r\nnternally even in unclean external circumstances, the external conditions d=\r\no not matter. One can then read without taking bath also.\n \nSo it all depen=\r\nds on your state of mind, for which you are the best judge. If you are unsu=\r\nre and have any concern at all, then be conservative, i.e. take bath and we=\r\nar clean clothes.\n \n2. I personally give priority to my ritual and not rece=\r\nive anyone in the middle of my rituals, i.e. I make them wait. If you must =\r\ninterrupt your pooja, then I see nothing wrong in continuing where you left=\r\n off.\n \n3. That is a good offering, but the fire has to be sufficient. Ladd=\r\nus may be a fine sweet, but we cannot feed them to a two month old baby. Si=\r\nmilarly, you cannot offer much kshir to a small fire.\n \nI do my daily Chand=\r\ni homam with a log of wood and there is a big fire. I can pretty much burn =\r\nanything. I can offer kshir, I can offer laddus or any other sweets. If you=\r\n also have a big enough fire, you can offer anything without troubling fire=\r\n. When your fire is small, you have to exert discretion.\n \nBTW, ancient gre=\r\nco-Roman civilizations had a fire ritual where entire bodies of killed anim=\r\nals were offered to gods in firepit and reduced to ashes by next morning.\n =\r\n\nIf the fire is big, any amount of materials can be offered.\n \n4. I am surp=\r\nrised that stainless steel lamps are used. In Andhra Pradesh (where I am fr=\r\nom), we mostly use silver or copper lamps. Even in US (where I live), we us=\r\ne silver lamps mostly. I have actually never seen steel lamps. For my daily=\r\n homam, I prefer a clay lamp to a silver lamp and use it.\n \nIf you are at a=\r\n stage where external things are just used as symbols based on the momentum=\r\n of previous karmas and do not mean much to you, then all this is irrelaven=\r\nt. Otherwise, I suggest using silver, brass, bronze, copper, clay etc inste=\r\nad of steel.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ashwin=\r\n Rawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, January 08, 2=\r\n009 12:03 PM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Path\n\n        Dear Sir,\n     =\r\n   It is said that Chandi Path can be done only after bathing.

After reading your articles, now I will not of=\r\nfer kshir as this is not good if fire goes off due to milk. Sir, Kshir offe=\r\nring is necessary for mother? I had read somewhere so I was doing this. \n  =\r\n      4.Generally now a days the Deepak is enlighted in Stainless Steel.
