What you wrote is wel=\r\nl-taken.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; That is why chastity and bramacarya has always been\n&gt; con=\r\nsidered the highest virtue. No YOga can happen without chastity.\n=C2=A0\nTha=\r\nt is absolutely correct. Brahmacharya and control of one&#39;s sexual thoughts =\r\nis quite needed to make spiritual progress.\n=C2=A0\nIf anybody maintains bra=\r\nhmacharya for one year while performing a 45 minute homam everyday or medit=\r\nating with Gayatri mantra (or some other mantra) for=C2=A03 hours everyday,=\r\n definitely he/she will cross some important hurdles and make some good pro=\r\ngress.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; It is clear why it is even more important for women to be c=\r\nhaste and\n&gt; pious considering the strength of Moon and Venus in her body-gr=\r\noss and\n&gt; causal.\n=C2=A0\nChastity and brahmacharya are *equally important* =\r\nfor men and women to make spiritual progress. But the level of difficulty o=\r\nne experiences in controlling the mind depends on various factors such as g=\r\nender and, more importantly,=C2=A0mental conditioning acquired from previou=\r\ns lives.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; At least, Somannath drekana should be checked for the per=\r\niod of poojas\n&gt; to see how the dasas support celibacy vow that is usually r=\r\nequired in\n&gt; the cases of sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nWell, two relevant points:\n=C2=A0\n(1) The astrology we know and underst=\r\nand is imperfect without a doubt. Even knowledge taught unambiguously by Ma=\r\nharshi Parasara is so misunderstood in this age. Then what to speak of know=\r\nledge not found in the available teachings of Parasara and available in the=\r\n &quot;secrets&quot; of various paramparas? It is quite prone to=C2=A0corruptions and=\r\n misunderstanding.=C2=A0Can we *rely* on it?\n=C2=A0\n(2) Astrology, even whe=\r\nn understood perfectly, only predicts the predisposition at a given time du=\r\ne to the dynamics of *previous* actions (karmas). The dynamics of previous =\r\nactions decides under what kind of circumstances one has to operate now. Th=\r\nose circumstances can place *limitations* on what actions can be performed =\r\n*now*. Depending on the seriousness of previous actions deciding the curren=\r\nt circumstances, the limitations can be either mere challenges or serious h=\r\nandicaps. But, in most cases, there are multiple actions possible currently=\r\n. Horoscope only decides the situations faced now. The actions performed *n=\r\now* are based on *free will* exerted now, which is NOT captured by the horo=\r\nscope.\n=C2=A0\nIf there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual pr=\r\nogress is definitely *the* thing. One should push one&#39;s free will to the ex=\r\ntreme when it comes to spiritual progress. It is worth it! Forget somanatha=\r\n drekkana and other tenets of astrology. When the inspiration comes from wi=\r\nthin, just boldly take a vow, pray to god and your guru (if you have no gur=\r\nu, think of me or my Guru Dr Manish Pandit) and do your best to keep the vo=\r\nw.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\n=C2=A0\nEven if one cannot keep brahmacharya, on=\r\ne can still do spiritual practices like homam and japam. It will atleast ke=\r\nep one floating (i.e. not sinking). Basically, one will keep accumulating s=\r\nhakti (purity) and keep consuming it. So purification is slow. But atleast =\r\nthere is no further impurification. With brahmacharya, one can actually sta=\r\nrt accumulating shakti and purify oneself much faster.\n\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding women doing sadhanas:\n=C2=A0A great Vedic scholar kn=\r\nown as Upasani maharaj lived at the time of Shirdi Sai Baba, about 100 year=\r\ns back. He was learned in several Vedas and Upanishads and did tremendous s=\r\nadhana. Once he realized Self, he threw away his orthodoxy and went against=\r\n the customs of the time boldly. He went and lived in Harijanwada (untoucha=\r\nbles colony), swept the floors there and forced the Brahmins from Brahmanaw=\r\nada (Brahmins colony) who revered him highly to come *there* if=C2=A0they w=\r\nanted to see him! He opened a Vedic school for women and taught them chanti=\r\nng Vedic mantras and performing traditional yajnas. He gave women of all bi=\r\nrths sacred thread and initiated them into vedic mantras and yajnas.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nWhen Shridi Sai Baba saw him oneday, he said &quot;Upasani is God Himself. Toda=\r\ny we will do pooja to Upasani!&quot; and made his disciples do a pooja to Upasan=\r\ni maharaj.\n=C2=A0\nA temple run by women stands in the place of Upasani maha=\r\nraj, a few miles away from Shirdi. If anyone goes to Shirdi, it is a good i=\r\ndea to go to that temple. Though it has no rush, it has very nice energy. I=\r\nt is a great place to meditate.\n=C2=A0\nAlso, Krishna temple at Alandi near =\r\nPune where Sant Jnaneshwar Maharaj went into underground samadhi 700 years =\r\nback (believed to be there even now) has a tremendous level of spiritual en=\r\nergy. It is also a great place for productive meditation.\n=C2=A0\nBest regar=\r\nds,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ hom=\r\nam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lesso=\r\nns (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windo=\r\nws): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- \n=C2=A0\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Tijana D=\r\namjanovic&quot; &lt;tijanadamjanovic@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; om krishna guru\n&gt; Dear Ana an=\r\nd other members of the thread,\n&gt; \n&gt; Difference exists and it makes the worl=\r\nd go round, which is perfectly\n&gt; fine. After it is understood properly, no =\r\npots and pans will be needed\n&gt; to define anyones role or place under the su=\r\nn...that shines the same\n&gt; to one and all. :)\n&gt; Shrimad Devi Bhagavatam (on=\r\ne of the Upapuranas) states that sexual\n&gt; urge is much stronger in the case=\r\n of women. This is not surprising as\n&gt; sexual urge is produced and governed=\r\n by the liquid fluctuation in the\n&gt; body (watter, blood, semen and hormones=\r\n in the first place). This\n&gt; fluctuation is much higher in woman`s body due=\r\n to the predominance of\n&gt; jala tatva in her body governed by planets Moon a=\r\nnd Venus. These two\n&gt; planets are also responsible for the producing of the=\r\n ojas (the\n&gt; finniest energetic product of our body that makes the brain fu=\r\nnction\n&gt; properly, it is often understood as a vigor, vitality and procreat=\r\nive\n&gt; power). In general, this means that women can produce more ojas than =\r\nman.\n&gt; How is this related to poojas and spirituality?\n&gt; Sexual energy, or =\r\nsexual thoughts, are being transformed into ojas in\n&gt; the process of yoga. =\r\nThe process of yoga as one of its aim has lifting\n&gt; of the ojas from its st=\r\norage in the primal chakra and its storing in\n&gt; the brain. The more ojas in=\r\n the brain the prettier, smarter and more\n&gt; spiritual we are. But this lift=\r\ning of the ojas can be done ONLY by\n&gt; chaste ones. That is why chastity and=\r\n bramacarya has always been\n&gt; considered the highest virtue. No YOga can ha=\r\nppen without chastity. It\n&gt; is clear why it is even more important for wome=\r\nn to be chaste and\n&gt; pious considering the strength of Moon and Venus in he=\r\nr body-gross and\n&gt; causal.\n&gt; Without chastity, yogic pratice can lead into =\r\na mental disorder as\n&gt; ojas and prana directly influence the work of the br=\r\nain centres. Thus\n&gt; it is crucial how demanding and serious the homam or po=\r\noja in\n&gt; question, or any other, is. Prohibition during the monthly cycle i=\r\ns\n&gt; based upon this also-increasing of the jala tatva and the sexual urge.\n=\r\n&gt; At least, Somannath drekana should be checked for the period of poojas\n&gt; =\r\nto see how the dasas support celibacy vow that is usually required in\n&gt; the=\r\n cases of sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. \n&gt; The approaches to t=\r\nhe final truth may be numerous and different, but\n&gt; all of them must find t=\r\nheir path through the Sushumna. The one who\n&gt; claims that this path is hidd=\r\nen or blocked to women simply lacks ojas\n&gt; in his/her brain.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; T=\r\nijana Damjanovic\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S.

After it is understood properly, no pots and pans will be needed&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; to define anyones role or place under the sun...that shines the same&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; to one and all. :)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shrimad Devi Bhagavatam (one of the Upapu=\r\nranas) states that sexual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; urge is much stronger in the case of wome=\r\nn. This is not surprising as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sexual urge is produced and governed b=\r\ny the liquid fluctuation in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; body (watter, blood, semen and horm=\r\nones in the first place). This&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fluctuation is much higher in woman`=\r\ns body due to the predominance of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; jala tatva in her body governed b=\r\ny\n planets Moon and Venus. These two&lt;BR&gt;&gt; planets are also responsible f=\r\nor the producing of the ojas (the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; finniest energetic product of our=\r\n body that makes the brain function&lt;BR&gt;&gt; properly, it is often understoo=\r\nd as a vigor, vitality and procreative&lt;BR&gt;&gt; power). In general, this mea=\r\nns that women can produce more ojas than man.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; How is this related t=\r\no poojas and spirituality?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sexual energy, or sexual thoughts, are b=\r\neing transformed into ojas in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the process of yoga. The process of y=\r\noga as one of its aim has lifting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the ojas from its storage in t=\r\nhe primal chakra and its storing in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the brain. The more ojas in the=\r\n brain the prettier, smarter and more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual we are. But this li=\r\nfting of the ojas can be done ONLY by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chaste ones. That is why chas=\r\ntity and bramacarya has always been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; considered the highest virtue. =\r\nNo YOga can happen without chastity. It&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is clear why it is\n even mo=\r\nre important for women to be chaste and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pious considering the stren=\r\ngth of Moon and Venus in her body-gross and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; causal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Without=\r\n chastity, yogic pratice can lead into a mental disorder as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ojas an=\r\nd prana directly influence the work of the brain centres. Thus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it i=\r\ns crucial how demanding and serious the homam or pooja in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; question,=\r\n or any other, is. Prohibition during the monthly cycle is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; based up=\r\non this also-increasing of the jala tatva and the sexual urge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At l=\r\neast, Somannath drekana should be checked for the period of poojas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nto see how the dasas support celibacy vow that is usually required in&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; the cases of sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The app=\r\nroaches to the final truth may be numerous and different, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; all o=\r\nf them must find their path through the Sushumna. The one who&lt;BR&gt;&gt; claim=\r\ns that this path is hidden or blocked to women simply lacks\n ojas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i=\r\nn his/her brain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tijana Damjanovic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; P.S.
