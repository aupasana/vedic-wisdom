Sain=\r\nts like Sai Baba and Ramakrishna acted angry sometimes, but I am sure they =\r\ndid not feel any anger in their heart.\n \nIt is not about how you come acros=\r\ns to others. It is about how you feel inside. A person who achieved sthitap=\r\nrajnata feels the same way whether good things happen or bad things happen.=\r\n He is not dull. He may look happy, sad, angry and calm at different times,=\r\n but his heart does not feel much emotion and in a calm and stable state al=\r\nwats.\n \n&quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is a good book to read to understand various asp=\r\nects related to sthitaprajnata. But, more than understanding that state, it=\r\n is important to make progress towards reaching that state oneself. Not thi=\r\nnking too much about what others do to you is a good starting point. \n \n(2)=\r\n One should always do one&#39;s dharma (right action). What Mr X should do in t=\r\nhis specific case depends on his dharma. The tasks assigned to Mr X by natu=\r\nre may require him to ignore the distraction posed by the rowdy person and =\r\nfocus on his main task. In another case, the tasks assigned to Mr X by natu=\r\nre may require him to beat up this aggressor and show something to some peo=\r\nple.\n \nEither could be correct. Right action changes from person to person =\r\nand situation to situation. However, as long as Mr X thinks &quot;this person un=\r\nfairly hit me. I should take revenge&quot; and takes action based on that thinki=\r\nng, he will be stuck and what Nature expecs from him will not be clear to h=\r\nim.\n \nOne who does not have a dense ego can mostly know what Nautre expects=\r\n from one, do the right actions and pay off karmik debts. One who has a den=\r\nse ego, which keeps interfering with one&#39;s sense of dharma, will be lost an=\r\nd engaging in unnecessary acts which increase the debts instead of reducing=\r\n them.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------- \n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; =\r\n&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, A=\r\npril 26, 2009 3:22 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n \n&gt; Namas=\r\nte Rao Garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; There are few questions-\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Accept whatever comes your =\r\nway with neither happiness nor sadness, &gt;but with a calm and relaxed mind. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not able to understand this state. if person  is neither happy n=\r\nor sad, then what kind of state of mind he/she is in?\n&gt; \n&gt; is it dullness? =\r\nor there is some exalted state which can be defined as supremely happy stat=\r\ne always or is it a great peacefullness? i have read that Swami Vivekananda=\r\n and other brother desciples used to display many a times expression of ext=\r\nreme emotions such as anger, cry, heated arguments etc... did not they reac=\r\nh Sthithpragya state?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it that a spiritually elevated person needs t=\r\no have a blank face? without any display of emotions?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; another=\r\n question is regarding Karma(Action and Reaction)\n&gt; \n&gt; Take a case - somebo=\r\ndy, say a rawdy person Slaps a person &#39;x&#39;.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Fantastic que=\r\nstion! Before I answer it, I want to say that I am impressed with the decri=\r\nption of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live in the greater Bosto=\r\nn area too?\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Karma and karmaphala (actio=\r\nn and reaction) are like pushing something and being pushing back as a reac=\r\ntion.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object with some force and that o=\r\nbject pushes you back karmically with the same force at a later point of ti=\r\nme, it is not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to pus=\r\nh again. You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. T=\r\nhat is reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has n=\r\nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and ap=\r\nply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction lat=\r\ner.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of me=\r\nntal equanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living person has a li=\r\nmited ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Nara=\r\nsimha Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and so things, who does so and=\r\n so things, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who =\r\nis the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandi=\r\nt etc etc). If the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely=\r\n unbound from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in th=\r\ne body. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies=\r\n and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and e=\r\nnvironment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature tracks t=\r\nhis change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to your old apa=\r\nrtment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature delivers the r=\r\neactions of all previous life actions to the sense of I-ness in this life.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will c=\r\nontinue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions from that bein=\r\ng. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an election=\r\n, being criticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being abused by h=\r\nusband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend etc etc are ex=\r\namples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s sense of I-ness i=\r\ns bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver reactions to previous ac=\r\ntions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result of previous good karma, it is=\r\n not necessary that one should be happy or excited or elated. Do not think =\r\nthat a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good karma is meaningful only if that =\r\nreaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheate=\r\nd, it is not necessary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not think that=\r\n a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s bad karma is meaningful only if that react=\r\nion disappoints him. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such that tha=\r\nt person cheats you now. How you feel about it now is not relevant as far a=\r\ns the old action-reaction equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, eq=\r\nual-minded and calm does not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; In fac=\r\nt, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is =\r\npreventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Sup=\r\npose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is =\r\nmerely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it with self-identific=\r\nation with the action, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is=\r\n irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and without doing anything,=\r\n you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to sto=\r\np the person from cheating you. Then your current actions would become a NE=\r\nW karma and you will have to face its reaction later. If you want to pay of=\r\nf old debts without incurring new ones, you have to behave like the person =\r\nyou described below. Accept whatever comes your way with neither happiness =\r\nnor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing wha=\r\nt seems like the right thing to do at the moment, with as little self-ident=\r\nification (sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at=\r\n this, your instincts and judgment will guide you better and show you the r=\r\night action.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; -------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: Karma\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karma=\r\ns if they are able to be in a neutral frame \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affect=\r\ned by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of o=\r\nurs lost his wife in a road accident a few years \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was cr=\r\nashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He very \n&gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up=\r\n, took her to the hospital and took care of all of his \n&gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards=\r\n her and the family. His wife was a very spiritual person \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and so is h=\r\ne. Right before the accident, his wife told him of her recent \n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditat=\r\nion experience and that she would probably be leaving her body \n&gt;&gt; &gt; soon. =\r\nher husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful=\r\n frame of mind even during the funeral process. Some folks felt it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to=\r\n be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a stable mind.

I have the utmost reverance towards him and also in=\r\n awe of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his spiritual level.

Before I answer it, \nI want to say =\r\nthat I am impressed with the decription of your friend. My \npranaams to him=\r\n. Does he live in the greater Boston area too?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nKarma and karmaphala (a=\r\nction and reaction) are like pushing something and being \npushing back as a=\r\n reaction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When you karmically \npush an obje=\r\nct with some force and that object pushes you back karmically with \nthe sam=\r\ne force at a later point of time, it is not necessary that you resist it \na=\r\nnd apply some more force to push again. You pushed it earlier. That is acti=\r\non. \nYou are being pushed now. That is reaction. How you take this push and=\r\n whether \nyou resist or not has nothing to do with the old action and react=\r\nion balance. IF \nyou resist and apply some force NOW, it becomes a new acti=\r\non which will get its \nreaction later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nEven a person of a high level o=\r\nf mental equanimity and stability does have an \nego. Each living person has=\r\n a limited ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and \nan identity (e.g. PV=\r\nR Narasimha Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and so \nthings, who does=\r\n so and so things, who wants so and so things, who is the \nhusband of Padma=\r\nja, who is the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the \nsishya of Man=\r\nish Pandit etc etc). If the binding is completely removed and one \nbecomes =\r\ncompletely unbound from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer \nr=\r\nemain in the body. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). =\r\nAs \none dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from on=\r\ne body \nand environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Na=\r\nture tracks \nthis change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed t=\r\no your old \napartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature=\r\n delivers the \nreactions of all previous life actions to the sense of I-nes=\r\ns in this \nlife.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied =\r\nand has a sense \nof I-ness, Nature will continue to deliver the reactions t=\r\no various previous \nactions from that being. Death of wife in an accident, =\r\ngetting an Oscar award, \nlosing an election, being criticized by thousand p=\r\neople, being hit by wife, \nbeing abused by husband, being killed by a broth=\r\ner, being cheated by a friend \netc etc are examples of reactions to previou=\r\ns actions. As long as one&#39;s sense of \nI-ness is bound to a body, Nature wil=\r\nl continue to deliver reactions to previous \nactions. If one gets an Oscar =\r\naward as a result of previous good karma, it is \nnot necessary that one sho=\r\nuld be happy or excited or elated. Do not think that a \nreaction from Natur=\r\ne to one&#39;s good karma is meaningful only if that reaction \nmakes one happy.=\r\n How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not \nnecessary t=\r\nhat one should feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from \nNature=\r\n to one&#39;s bad karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. \nY=\r\nou cheated someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats you no=\r\nw. \nHow you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old action-reac=\r\ntion \nequation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm =\r\ndoes not \nstop Nature from doing its job.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; In=\r\n fact, it is \nbetter that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, on=\r\ne is preventing new \nkarmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous lif=\r\ne. Suppose Nature arranged \nfor that person to cheat you now. His cheating =\r\nyou is merely a reaction to your \nown action (but if he does it with self-i=\r\ndentification with the action, it \nbecomes a new karma for that person. But=\r\n, that is irrelevant to you). If you \njust face it calmly and without doing=\r\n anything, you finish off your karmic debt. \nInstead, suppose you fight and=\r\n try to stop the person from cheating you. Then \nyour current actions would=\r\n become a NEW karma and you will have to face its \nreaction later. If you w=\r\nant to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you \nhave to behave li=\r\nke the person you described below. Accept whatever comes your \nway with nei=\r\nther happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed mind. On top \nof it=\r\n, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at the moment, with as \n=\r\nlittle self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) as possible. As you=\r\n \nbecome better at this, your instincts and judgment will guide you better =\r\nand \nshow you the right action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Best \nregard=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n-------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nDo a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsiz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&gt; \n--------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------- \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: \nThursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Karma&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsim=\r\nhaji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; How does \none burn their karmas if =\r\nthey are able to be in a neutral frame &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; of mind and not b=\r\ne affected by what is percieved as misfortune?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road \naccident a fe=\r\nw years &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.
