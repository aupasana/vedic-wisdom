In f=\r\nact, betel leaves themselves are a \n&gt; substitute.\n&gt; \n&gt; The original method =\r\nis to create aasanas (seats) for planets and other \n&gt; celestial beings with=\r\n different grains. For example, go to the Boston \n&gt; saamoohika Satya Naraya=\r\nna vratam album at\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; https://picasaweb.google.com/padmaja.bandaru/Bo=\r\nstonSaamoohikaSatyanarayanaVratam\n&gt; \n&gt; and see photo 6 or 13. Seats are mad=\r\ne with different grains arranged in \n&gt; different basic geometric shapes.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Instead of that elaborate arrangement, the tradition of using a betel \n&gt;=\r\n leaf as the seat for each planet/deity has come.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you just lay out =\r\na few rice grains for each deity and place the \n&gt; idol/coin on them, that i=\r\ns fine too.\n&gt; \n&gt; The planets and deities are already within us. For example=\r\n, Jupiter \n&gt; lives in us as our wisdom and judgment. Saturn lives within us=\r\n as our \n&gt; discipline, patience and persistence. Yama lives within us as di=\r\nscipline \n&gt; and the ability to follow rules. Nirriti lives within us as the=\r\n spirit \n&gt; of discovery and crossing barriers. And so on. If those qualitie=\r\ns are \n&gt; firmly established in one&#39;s consciousness, what seat is offered to=\r\n \n&gt; corresponding deities in the ritual is highly secondary!\n&gt; \n&gt; Irrespect=\r\nive of what seat you use (made of grains arranged in a shape or \n&gt; betel le=\r\nad or just rice grains), contemplate the nature represented by \n&gt; the deity=\r\n and imagine that the deity has really come and sat there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;  =\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Feb 16, 2011 at 10:29 PM, nagraj@... wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there anything to substitute the beetel leaves =\r\nin Satya Narayana \n&gt; Vratam?
