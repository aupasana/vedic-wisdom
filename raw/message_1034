Having abundant wealth does not \nmean that one is running after wealth (though most wealthy persons are \naddicted to wealth). A famous man may not be addicted to fame (though many \nare). A man with ten wives may not be addicted to sex (thought many are).\n\nRenunciation that frees one is at the mental level and not necessarily at \nthe physical level. Physical renunciation of things promotes mental \nrenunciation, but does not guarantee it. On the other hand, mental \nrenunciation is possible without physical renunciation. One may renounce the \nmaterial world and live under a tree in a forest alone for the entire life \nand yet not overcome the instinctual attraction to money, fame and sex. \nAnother person may live in the middle of wealth, fame and glamor, yet remain \ndetached from all of it it and surrender at the feet of god despite being \nvery active in many ways. It is all in the mind.\n\nOne needs to interact with the world and world objects in order to pay back \none&#39;s rinas. The karmas taken on by Swami Vivekananda when he voluntarily \nchose to come back to earth required him to become famous and spread the \nmessage of sanatana dharma to varrious corners of the world. He *had* to \nbecome famous for fulfilling his dharma. It does not mean he craved for \nfame. He did not. In fact, his guru moulded him and released him into the \nworld only after he was strong and detached enough to be unaffected by fame.\n\nSimilarly, a king like Dasaratha (or a queen like Draupadi!) may marry \nseveral people in order to pay back the rinas that had to be paid back in \nthat life.\n\nRemember one fundamental point: We exist on earth in order to fulfil our \ndharma. We must do it without incurring new karmas and becoming attached. So \nwhat we do should be based on our personal dharma (as decided by our \ninstincts, intelligence and gurus). But what is important is *how* we do it. \n*That* is what decides the new karmas incurred for future. If we can do \nwhatever we do with a spirit of detachment and with a sense of surrender to \nthe Lord, we minimize our chances of incurring new troublesome karmas.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;murahariv&quot; &lt;murahariv@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 12:48 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Polygamy and Spiritualism\n\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I had happened to read a very inspiring book by Swami Rama (Living\n&gt; with Himalayan Masters) and it&#39;s noted there that for spiritual\n&gt; upliftment the following has to be done:\n&gt; a) See Godliness in all\n&gt; b) Consider objects as the means and not the end\n&gt; c) Do not covet for wealth, fame and women.\n&gt;\n&gt; My understanding is that these are the concepts that are taken from\n&gt; Vedic Literature as these yogis are followers of jnana and raja\n&gt; yogas.\n&gt;\n&gt; If this hypothesis is correct, why is it that we happen to hear\n&gt; polygamous marriages in the olden days (King Dasaratha, King\n&gt; Vichitravirya etc) King Dasaratha is supposed to be a spiritually\n&gt; enlightened person(Ashtavakra Gita etc) but why this contradiction\n&gt; with regard to marriages here?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks & Regards,\n&gt; --Murahari\n\n\n"}}
