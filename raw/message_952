Rao &lt;pvr@charte=\r\nr.net&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;    Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; Mantras work beyond the physical sound ener=\r\ngy level and work at the mind\n&gt; level. Mind connects the material and non-m=\r\naterial realms of experience. So\n&gt; all experiences of mind cannot be studie=\r\nd by physics or modern science in\n&gt; general.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to narrate a small =\r\nincident. At this time, the person in question\n&gt; prefers not to be explicit=\r\nly identified.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; One man was sleeping oneday. In =\r\nthe middle of the night, he woke up. When\n&gt; he was still on the bed and par=\r\ntially awake, his shakti rose. In other\n&gt; words, his self-awareness got ref=\r\nined. He first perceived a tremendous bolt\n&gt; of electricity going up in his=\r\n back. Then, in a split second, his perception\n&gt; of that electricity change=\r\nd from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;.\n&gt; His changed perception wa=\r\ns that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that\n&gt; was surging up like a=\r\nn ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there\n&gt; and that he was a=\r\n very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, he\n&gt; also &quot;heard&quot; a =\r\nspecific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of\n&gt; people, who w=\r\nere all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated\n&gt; with the soun=\r\nd of that beejaakshara and he perceived that he too was\n&gt; chanting that bee=\r\njaakshara along with all. His mind was filled with that\n&gt; sound and a kind =\r\nof bliss. His self-awareness was that of a tiny particle\n&gt; filled with that=\r\n sound and joy. He was in that state for a while. Suddenly a\n&gt; thought that=\r\n can be loosely expressed as &quot;I am on the bed in a room. How am\n&gt; I hearing=\r\n all this? Are there people in the room&quot; came to his mind. That\n&gt; thought d=\r\nisturbed the state of his mind and his shakti came down. In other\n&gt; words, =\r\nhe returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again\n&gt; perceived th=\r\nat he was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone\n&gt; and mind wa=\r\ns again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n&gt;\n&gt; He mentioned this in=\r\ncident a few days later to his spiritual guru, who\n&gt; lived thousands of mil=\r\nes away and a few hours ahead of him. When this\n&gt; happened, it was the midd=\r\nle of the night for him and morning for his guru.\n&gt; When he mentioned the i=\r\nncident and said that he heard the sound of a\n&gt; beejaakshara reverberating =\r\nin the wave in which he was a small particle, his\n&gt; guru said he knew it an=\r\nd also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked\n&gt; &quot;that is what you he=\r\nard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. When he confirmed,\n&gt; his guru shed so=\r\nme light: &quot;I was at that time meditating with that\n&gt; beejaakshara. So and s=\r\no deity came and filled my consciousness. I then went\n&gt; into samadhi. Some =\r\npeople close to me may also have experienced that deity\n&gt; at that time. But=\r\n we should realize that this is all Her play and we are\n&gt; just nimittas. Wh=\r\nat she does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We\n&gt; are just dummie=\r\ns observing what comes our way. We neither make anything\n&gt; happen nor shoul=\r\nd we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not\n&gt; be attracted =\r\nor repelled by anything.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are talking ab=\r\nout the mystical experiences perceived by a single\n&gt; mind, the possibility =\r\nof hallucination cannot be discounted. However, when\n&gt; two people independe=\r\nntly experienced something similar and one of them knew\n&gt; that the other on=\r\ne experienced it, it shows that there is something here. It\n&gt; shows that th=\r\ne ultimate Reality is *beyond* the reality that can be\n&gt; perceived by sense=\r\ns and studied by modern science.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mind is the connection between the mat=\r\nerial and non-material worlds.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ego, the sense of &quot;I&quot;, is what blocks on=\r\ne from higher things. Notions like\n&gt; &quot;I am the body&quot;, &quot;I should be safe&quot;, &quot;=\r\nI should be happy&quot; etc block one and\n&gt; limit one&#39;s self-awareness to a gros=\r\ns body and its gross external senses.\n&gt; When the self-awareness changes to =\r\nthat of a tiny particle at His/Her feet,\n&gt; it is a lot more blissful state =\r\nto be in. But, we are kept away from that\n&gt; because our self-awareness is d=\r\nifferent and more gross and we cannot let it\n&gt; go! We just hang on to an un=\r\ndesirable self-awareness.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to make one th=\r\ning clear. When I write about any mystical\n&gt; experiences, there is a chance=\r\n of influencing someone wrongly. Luckily for\n&gt; me, the first thing my guru =\r\ndid with me was to de-emphasize the value of\n&gt; mystical experiences. I was =\r\nprepared by him to look at them as just any\n&gt; other experiences in the mate=\r\nrial world. They really are. When one goes on a\n&gt; road, one sees nice scene=\r\nry on the side. Some scenery on a normal road may\n&gt; be accessible to everyo=\r\nne and some scenery at a high altitude hill road may\n&gt; be seen by very few.=\r\n But the bottomline is that both are sceneries and one\n&gt; should learn to ju=\r\nst see it, appreciate it and move on. If attachment is\n&gt; built with a scene=\r\nry or one becomes proud of oneself for having seen a\n&gt; scenery, it is fooli=\r\nsh. Such feelings can distract one from the final goal\n&gt; and slow down one&#39;=\r\ns journey. Nothing in the 14 worlds needs to be desired or\n&gt; feared. Just o=\r\nbserve what comes your way and continue your journey.\n&gt;\n&gt; A mystical experi=\r\nence can promote pride in one (&quot;I am good and I got this&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;I did good sa=\r\ndhana and so I got this&quot;, &quot;I deserve this&quot; etc) or attachment\n&gt; or possessi=\r\nveness or a sense of entitlement. That can trap one and slow down\n&gt; spiritu=\r\nal progress. The ultimate goal of spiritual sadhana is to kill pride\n&gt; and =\r\novercome ego completely. That should be remembered at all times.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know=\r\n that I mention this again and again. But internet and e-archives are\n&gt; a n=\r\nonlinear medium.
