(May not be good time for pur=\r\nchasing a TV set...:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; It should be a very good Muhurt as well to star=\r\nt a spiritual effort(s) for \n&gt; consistancy and patient hardwork as well as =\r\nlong lasting positive effects.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1stly its an Amaavasya, 2ndly It is a S=\r\nhani Jayanti, 3rd Shani is almost \n&gt; Stationary (Sthira) and Last but not t=\r\nhe least, eclipse also happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cold (Shani-like) Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpa=\r\nl\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
