Swami Yog=\r\nananda is one of\nthe sixteen monastic disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,=\r\n along with\nSwami Vivekananda. He was forced to marry, but never slept with=\r\n his\nown wife. Swami Vivekananda once said &quot;if any of us (disciples of\nRama=\r\nkrishna) conquered lust completely and in all respects, it is\nJoginder (Swa=\r\nmi Yogananda)&quot;. There is no question of Swami Yogananda\nbeing accused of dr=\r\ninking and having women etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda is a sishya of Yuk=\r\nteshwar Maharaj and from the\nlineage of Mahavatar Babaji. They practice kri=\r\nya yoga. I do not know\nmuch about him.\n\n\n\nFor what it is worth, you can rea=\r\nd more about Paramahamsa Yogananda in\nhis free+online autobiography,\nhere h=\r\nttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi\n\nThere were interestin=\r\ng links between Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and\nParamahamsa Yogananda:-\nFor exa=\r\nmple, one of the top disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was\nMahendranath =\r\nGupta (not sure if he was one of the 16 monastic\ndisciples that Narasimhaji=\r\n refers to) aka Master Mahasaya, who wrote\n&quot;The Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;\n(htt=\r\np://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendranath_Gupta), and was the\nsanskrit tutor t=\r\no Paramahamsa Yogananda as well; the latter devoted an\nentire chapter to hi=\r\nm in his \nbook : http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chap=\r\nter_9\n\nElsewhere in his autobiography Paramhamsa Yogananda also mentions an=\r\n\nanecdote of a disciple to whom he gifted a silver cup, who as a young\nman =\r\nwas told by Swami Vivekandana that the Guru in his life would\npresent him w=\r\nith a silver cup in the future.\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography=\r\n_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_47\n\nMakes you wonder about the Divine connection between=\r\n all these\nsupremely elevated souls!\n\nBest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; *         *         *=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; The link you gave is about neither Swami Yogananda nor Paramahamsa\nY=\r\nogananda, but some propaganda about Ramakrishna Paramahamsa himself,\nbased =\r\non some bali he apparently gave.

But Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa\nstands out in one way. He is one master who mastered every single\npa=\r\nth. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja\nyoga. H=\r\ne worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several\nforms. He eve=\r\nn reached the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is\nno &quot;experience&quot;. =\r\nHe was in sahaja samadhi always. He was able induce\ntremendous experience i=\r\nn people by mere touch or mere look. Yet he was\nsimple like a child and had=\r\n zero ego (that is why he could do all\nthat!!!).\n&gt; \n&gt;     Many &quot;gurus&quot; forc=\r\ne their dharma on their sishyas and have no\nability to recognize the true n=\r\nature and dharma of each sishya. They\nforce sishyas to chant the mantra the=\r\ny chant, worship the form they\nworship and walk the path they walk. Ramakri=\r\nshna had deep insight into\nthe true nature of each sishya and gave specific=\r\n instructions. He\ntaught totally different mantras, totally different forms=\r\n and totally\ndifferent paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradic=\r\ntory\nthings to different sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his\nag=\r\ngressive attitude roughed up somebody for insulting his guru, he\nscolded &quot;s=\r\nhame on you. With your attitude, you did not defend your\nguru, but brought =\r\nshame to him. You should learn to be calm and ignore\nsuch insults. THAT wil=\r\nl place your guru in a good stead and not your\naggression&quot;. When another si=\r\nshya who needed to mend his soft demeanor\nignored insults of Ramakrishna by=\r\n some people and came away silently,\nhe scolded him &quot;shame on you. Shastras=\r\n say that you should kill one\nwho insults your guru. How can you ignore suc=\r\nh wrong behavior? You\nshould give them a piece of your mind.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Spir=\r\nitual sadhana does not mean just chanting a mantra or\nrepeating a procedure=\r\n everyday for a certain period of time. Spiritual\nsadhana is a continuous p=\r\nrocess by which one transforms oneself from\ninside out and purifies oneself=\r\n. That way, every action and every\nthought becomes a sadhana and offers an =\r\nopportunity for introspection\nand transformation of internal attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n     Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal\nsadhaka =\r\nor a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of\nsadhakas and he wa=\r\ns an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of\nsishyas.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Without =\r\nhis [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobody and would\nbe lower than dirt.=\r\n I would not be able to say anything intelligent or\nmeaningful in spiritual=\r\n matters. Those who are impressed/inspired by\nsomething I write should be t=\r\nhankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit and\nto Sri Ramakrishna for showering th=\r\neir grace using me as an instrument\nand not to me.\n&gt; \n&gt;     BTW, you are al=\r\nl free to forward my posts that you like to\npeople who may be interested in=\r\n spiritual discussions.

It is\ndan=\r\ngerous to follow someone \n&gt;               else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;             =\r\n  Following the path of dharma basically means engaging\nin the right \n&gt;    =\r\n           action/duty. Right action varies from person to\nperson, from tim=\r\ne to time \n&gt;               and from place to place. It is dependent on what=\r\n\nnature expects from you, \n&gt;               which in turn is based on who yo=\r\nu have been in the\npast, what actions you \n&gt;               did in the past =\r\nwhile identifying with the action, who\nyou affected in the \n&gt;              =\r\n past (and how) with the actions that you identified\nwith, what debts you \n=\r\n&gt;               created in the process, and what mental tendencies you\naccu=\r\nmulated until \n&gt;               now.\n&gt; \n&gt;               If, based on one&#39;s m=\r\nental tendencies and karmic debts,\nnature wants a person \n&gt;               t=\r\no kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If,\nbased on one&#39;s mental \n=\r\n&gt;               tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to\nsprea=\r\nd the message of \n&gt;               uniformity of all religions, that becomes=\r\n one&#39;s\ndharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n&gt;               mental tendencies and ka=\r\nrmic debts, nature wants a\nperson to spread the \n&gt;               ritual of =\r\nhomam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s\ndharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n&gt;       =\r\n        mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\nperson to make a=\r\n lot of \n&gt;               money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s d=\r\nharma.\n&gt; \n&gt;               * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;               The dharma of a being ma=\r\ny change from one life to another.\n&gt; \n&gt;               At the time of Mahabh=\r\narata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma\nto kill his gurus, \n&gt;               elder=\r\ns and relatives. The time then was such that\nthere was too much weight \n&gt;  =\r\n             on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of\nsome weight=\r\n. Tremendous \n&gt;               destruction was to take place and civilizatio=\r\nn\ndestroyed to a great extent, \n&gt;               to welcome Kali yuga and se=\r\nt the tone for it. Arjuna\nbeing a great warrior, \n&gt;               it was hi=\r\ns dharma to facilitate that. Some people he\ndeeply loved and \n&gt;            =\r\n   respected were on the other side and it was his dharma\nto kill them.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;               When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th\ncentury as =\r\none of \n&gt;               Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda=\r\n\nhad been Arjuna in a \n&gt;               previous life, according to Ramakris=\r\nhna) , his dharma\nwas different in this \n&gt;               new time and place=\r\n. He was born to renounce material\nlife despite his \n&gt;               aristo=\r\ncratic upbringing and live the simple life of a\nmonk and inspire \n&gt;        =\r\n       generations to embrace a simple life of mental\ndetachment and servic=\r\ne to \n&gt;               others. When he is born again (which he has to, as pe=\r\nr\nwhat Ramakrishna \n&gt;               said), his dharma based on the time and=\r\n place may be\nsomething else.\n&gt; \n&gt;               * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;               T=\r\nhe tricky question is: How does one decide what is\none&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; \n&gt;      =\r\n         Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying\n&quot;follow your o=\r\nwn dharma \n&gt;               and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of\nc=\r\nastism. Though the concept \n&gt;               of caste (varna) has been there=\r\n in Hinduism for a long\ntime, the concept of \n&gt;               caste mobilit=\r\ny was very much there. Valmiki was a\nshudra who lived by \n&gt;               k=\r\nilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi\nlater. Vishwamitra was a =\r\n\n&gt;               kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana\nand an=\r\nd a maharshi \n&gt;               later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. =\r\nOne\nstarts off with the varna \n&gt;               of father, because that is w=\r\nhat one is exposed to in\nchildhood. As one \n&gt;               develops in lif=\r\ne, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on\nwhat one does.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Thus=\r\n, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which\ntells you to know your \n&gt; =\r\n              dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are\nnot just=\r\n 4 dharmas in \n&gt;               the world. Each person has individual dharma=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very\ndifficu=\r\nlt. If one is pure \n&gt;               enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. I=\r\nn fact, all of\nus have a part of our \n&gt;               mind that tells us wh=\r\nat our dharma is, but it is\nsurrounded by a lot of \n&gt;               noise f=\r\nrom other parts of our minds which tell other\nthings. Thus, we get \n&gt;      =\r\n         confused.\n&gt; \n&gt;               We should make the best judgment comb=\r\nining\ndiscrimination and intuition and \n&gt;               decide what is our =\r\ndharma and follow it sincerely. We\nmay be err, but doing \n&gt;               t=\r\nhe best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; \n&gt;               More than followin=\r\ng dharma, what is of utmost\nimportance is to engage in \n&gt;               act=\r\nions without identification. *That* alone ensures\nthat we are not \n&gt;       =\r\n        accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.\nWe should no=\r\nt build \n&gt;               too much attachment to what we are doing. We shoul=\r\nd\nengage in the best \n&gt;               possible actions (based on our best j=\r\nudgment on what\nour dharma in the given \n&gt;               situation is), wit=\r\nh as little attachment and\nself-identification with the \n&gt;               ac=\r\ntion as possible. When the action is finished, we\nshould leave the result \n=\r\n&gt;               to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will\nhappen n=\r\now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt;               work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma =\r\nyoga\n(unfication through \n&gt;               untached action) will simplify ou=\r\nr ego and purify our\nconsciousness slowly. \n&gt;               As we become pu=\r\nrer, our mind will work sharper and\ntell our dharma clearer. \n&gt;            =\r\n   There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly\nenable us to see our=\r\n \n&gt;               dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new\nkarmas=\r\n. This is not easy, \n&gt;               but not as difficult as people think.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;               The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s\ndh=\r\narma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt;               &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with=\r\n time if one\nengages in action with \n&gt;               little attachment.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;               * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;               In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s in=\r\ntellect and\nintuition are the inputs. \n&gt;               Another external inp=\r\nut is the words of scriptures and\nlearned men. One can \n&gt;               der=\r\nive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is\ngiven to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; =\r\n              master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one\ncan take=\r\n the words of \n&gt;               the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and fol=\r\nlow it\nsincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt;               When Arjuna was confused about what hi=\r\ns dharma was and\nthought killing gurus \n&gt;               and relatives was n=\r\not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna\nwho clarified his \n&gt;               dhar=\r\nma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was\nconfused about his dharma \n&gt; =\r\n              and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded\nplace t=\r\no do sadhana, \n&gt;               Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed =\r\nupon him\nto stay in the material \n&gt;               world and do the work of =\r\nMother for him.\n&gt; \n&gt;               One who is not in tune with nature and d=\r\noes not know\nwho one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt;               debts are and what nat=\r\nure expects from one can err in\nthe judgment of what \n&gt;               one&#39;s=\r\n dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul\nwith a clear insight into \n&gt; =\r\n              one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n               * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;               Bottomline is that I (or anybody) c=\r\nannot outline a set\nof principles and \n&gt;               declare that as the =\r\ndharma. No, dharma changes from\nperson to person, from \n&gt;               tim=\r\ne to time and from place to place. Also, there are\nno thumbrules to find \n&gt;=\r\n               out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s\nundersta=\r\nnding of one&#39;s \n&gt;               dharma by increasing internal purity. By do=\r\ning various\nkinds of spiritual \n&gt;               sadhana (like homam, japam =\r\netc) and engaging in\nactions without much \n&gt;               attachment, one =\r\ncan slowly purify oneself and refine\none&#39;s understanding of \n&gt;             =\r\n  one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Best regards,\n&gt;              =\r\n Narasimha\n&gt;               ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n----\n--------- -\n&gt;               Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst\nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt;               Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst\nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;               Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-\nwisdom\n&gt;               Free Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): http://vedicastro.\nhome.comcast. net\n&gt;               Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAst\nrologer.org\n&gt;               Sri Jagannat=\r\nh Centre (SJC) website:\nhttp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;               ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n--------- - \n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;               From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahi=\r\nyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt;               To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;               Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt;              =\r\n Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; \n&gt;               &gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;      =\r\n         &gt;\n&gt;               &gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt;            =\r\n   &gt; and in it in last part\n&gt;               &gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma=\r\n is very personal.\n&gt;               &gt; Can somebody share views on that and h=\r\now can we approach\n&gt;               &gt; towards it\n&gt;               &gt; Does it h=\r\nas to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt;               &gt;\n&gt;           =\r\n    &gt; regards\n&gt;               &gt; jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
