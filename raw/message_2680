By\nthe time He was 20, He had already attained Nirvikalpa Sama=\r\ndhi and by\nrepeated attainment of this sublime state, had become a Jeevanmu=\r\nkta.\nBut the paradoxical part of this was that Acharyal had already\nattaine=\r\nd the Highest before He was 20, but His formal lessons in\nVedanta commenced=\r\n only after He was 23 ! &quot;\n\nbhavadiiyaH,\n\n      ajit\n\n\nrajarshi nandy wrote:=\r\n\n\n&gt; Whatever be the path, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Sha=\r\nnkara, they say, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. Bu=\r\nt I feel, he engaged in all these once he had already become a gyani throug=\r\nh his sadhana. He was not a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scr=\r\niptures, he was a gyani because he had achieved a state of oneness.\n\n"}}
