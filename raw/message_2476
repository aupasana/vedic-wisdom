Mise=\r\nry is\nonly an unwanted thought. The mind is not strong enough to resist it.=\r\n It can\nbe strengthened by worship of God.=94 -- Talks 241\n\n=93I have no pe=\r\nace of mind. Something prevents it =97 probably my destiny.=94\nBhagavan ans=\r\nwers: =93What is destiny? There is no destiny. Surrender and all\nwill be we=\r\nll. Throw all the responsibility on God. Do not bear the burden\nyourself. W=\r\nhat can destiny do to you then?=94 -- Talks 244\n\n=93Siva made over all His =\r\npossessions to Vishnu and went roaming about in\nforests, wildernesses and g=\r\nraveyards, living on begged food. He found\nnon-possession to be higher in t=\r\nhe scale of happiness than possessions. The\nhigher happiness is freedom fro=\r\nm anxiety =97 anxiety over how to protect the\npossessions and how to utilis=\r\ne them, etc.=94 -- Talks 225\n\n=93If happiness is due to one=92s possessions=\r\n, then it should increase and\ndecrease proportionately to their increase an=\r\nd decrease, and becomes nil if\none has nothing to possess. But is this true=\r\n? Does experience bear this out?\n=93In deep sleep one is devoid of possessi=\r\nons, including one=92s own body; yet\none then is supremely happy. Everyone =\r\ndesires sound sleep. The conclusion is\nthat happiness is inherent in one=92=\r\ns own self and is not due to external\ncauses. One must realise his Self in =\r\norder to open for oneself the store of\nunalloyed happiness.=94 -- Talks 3\n\n=\r\n=93What is happiness? Is it inherent in the Self or in the object, or in th=\r\ne\ncontact between the subject and the object?=94 Bhagavan: =93When there is=\r\n\ncontact with a desirable object or memory thereof, and when there is freed=\r\nom\nfrom undesirable contacts, or memory thereof, we say there is happiness.=\r\n\nSuch happiness is relative and is better called pleasure. But we want\nabso=\r\nlute and permanent happiness. This does not reside in objects but in the\nAb=\r\nsolute. It is peace free from pain and pleasure =97 it is a neutral state.=\r\n=94\n-- Talks 28\n\n=93There is a state beyond our efforts and effortlessness.=\r\n Until it is\nrealised, effort is necessary. (This is the state of samadhi, =\r\nwhich is\nblissful). After tasting such bliss even once, one will repeatedly=\r\n try to\nregain it. Having once experienced the bliss of peace, no one would=\r\n like to\nbe out of it, or engage himself otherwise. It is as difficult for =\r\nthe Jnani\nto engage in thought as it is for an ajnani to be free from thoug=\r\nht. Any\nkind of activity does not affect a jnani; his mind remains ever in =\r\neternal\npeace.=94 -- Talks 141\n\n=93The universe exists on account of the =\r\n=91I=92-thought. If that ends there is an\nend of misery also. The person wh=\r\no is in sleep is also now awake. There is\nhappiness in sleep but misery in =\r\nwakefulness. In sleep there was no\n=91I=92-thought, but it is now while awa=\r\nke. The state of happiness in sleep is\neffortless. We should therefore aim =\r\nto bring about that state even now. That\nrequires effort.=94 -- Talks 222\n\n=\r\n=93Your nature is happiness. You say that this is not apparent. See what\nob=\r\nstructs you from your true being. It is pointed out to you that the\nobstruc=\r\ntion is the wrong identity. Eliminate the error. The patient himself\nmust t=\r\nake the medicine to cure his illness. If, as you say, the patient is\ntoo we=\r\nak to help himself, then he must remain quiet, giving a free hand to\nthe do=\r\nctor. That is effortlessness.=94 -- Talks 295\n\n=93The desire for happiness =\r\nis a proof of the ever-existent happiness of the\nSelf. Otherwise how can de=\r\nsire for it arise? If headache were natural to\nhuman beings, no one would t=\r\nry to get rid of it. One desires only that which\nis natural to him.Happines=\r\ns, being natural, it is not acquired. Primal bliss\nis obscured by the not-S=\r\nelf, which is non-bliss, or misery. Loss of\nunhappiness amounts to gaining =\r\nof happiness. When misery is eliminated the\nbliss which is ever-present is =\r\nsaid to be gained. Happiness mixed with\nmisery is only misery.=94 -- Talks =\r\n619\n\n=93Why should there be suffering now?=94 Bhagavan: =93If there were no=\r\n suffering,\nhow could the desire to be happy arise? If that desire did not =\r\narise,how\nwould the quest of the Self be successful? What is happiness? Is =\r\nit a\nhealthy and handsome body, or timely meals and the like? Even an Emper=\r\nor has\nendless troubles, though he may be healthy. All suffering is due to =\r\nthe\nfalse notion =91I-am-the-body=92. Getting rid of it is jnanam.=94 -- Ta=\r\nlks 633\n\nNews of someone=92s death was brought to the Master. He remarked: =\r\n=93Good. The\ndead are indeed happy. They have got rid of the troublesome ov=\r\nergrowth =97 the\nbody.The dead man does not grieve. The survivors grieve fo=\r\nr him. Do men fear\nsleep? On the contrary they court it and on waking up th=\r\ney remark that they\nhave had a happy sleep. Yet sleep is nothing but tempor=\r\nary death. Death is a\nlong sleep.=94 -- Talks 64\n\n=93See how a tree, whose =\r\nbranches are cut grows again. So long as the\nlife-source is not affected it=\r\n will grow. Similarly the samskaras sink into\nthe heart in death: they do n=\r\not perish. They are reborn. Just as a big\nbanyan tree sprouts from a tiny s=\r\need, so the wide universe with names and\nforms sprouts forth from the Heart=\r\n.=94 -- Talks 108\n\n=93If a person we love dies, grief results. Shall we avo=\r\nid grief by loving all\nalike, or by not loving at all?=94 Bhagavan: =93Both=\r\n amount to the same thing.\nWhen all have become the one Self, who remains t=\r\no be loved or hated? The ego\nthat grieves must die. That is the only way.=\r\n=94 -- Talks 252\n\n=93As long as you feel yourself the doer of action so lon=\r\ng you are bound to\nenjoy its fruits. But if you find out whose karma it is,=\r\n you will see that\nyou are not the doer. Then you will be free. This requir=\r\nes the Grace of God,\nfor which you should pray to Him and meditate on Him.=\r\n=94 -- Talks 115\n\n=93Action without motive does not bind. Even a Jnani acts=\r\n and there can be no\naction without effort and without sankalpas =97 motive=\r\ns. Therefore there are\nsankalpas for everyone. But these are of two kinds, =\r\nthe binding\n(bandha-hetu) and the liberating (mukti-hetu). The former must =\r\nbe given up\nand the latter cultivated.=94 -- Talks 115\n\n=93It is not enough=\r\n that one thinks of God while doing karma (service, or\nworship), but one mu=\r\nst continually and unceasingly think of Him. Only then\nwill the mind become=\r\n pure.=94 Bhagavan=92s attendant then remarked: =93Is it then\nnot enough th=\r\nat I serve Bhagavan physically, but must also remember him\nconstantly?=94 T=\r\no which Bhagavan remarked: =93=91I-am-the-body=92 idea must vanish\nthrough =\r\nvichara.=94 -- Talks 337\n\n=93Your idea of will-power is success insured, wh=\r\nereas willpower should be\nunderstood as the strength of mind which meets su=\r\nccess and failure with\nequanimity. It is not synonymous with certain succes=\r\ns.Why should one=92s\nattempts be always attended with success? Success deve=\r\nlops arrogance and\none=92s spiritual progress is thereby arrested. Failures=\r\n on the other hand are\nbeneficial, inasmuch as they open one=92s eyes to on=\r\ne=92s limitations and\nprepare him to surrender himself. Therefore one shoul=\r\nd try to gain equipoise\nof mind under all circumstances. That is will-power=\r\n. Again success and\nfailure are the results of prarabdha and not of will-po=\r\nwer. One man may be\ndoing only good and yet prove a failure. Another may do=\r\n otherwise and yet be\nuniformly successful. This does not mean that the wil=\r\nl-power is absent in\none and present in the other.=94 -- Talks 423\n\n=93Leav=\r\ne off false notions and perceive intuitively the Real.That alone\nmatters. I=\r\nf you melt a gold ornament what matters how it is melted, whole or\nin parts=\r\n, or of what shape the ornament had been? You are only interested in\nthe go=\r\nld. Realise the Self.=94 -- Talks 31\n\n=93Celibacy is certainly an aid to re=\r\nalisation among so many other aids.=94 --\nTalks 17\n\n=93Is not then celibacy=\r\n indispensable? Can a married man realise the Self?=94\nBhagavan: =93Certain=\r\nly, it (Realisation) is a matter of fitness of mind.\nMarried or unmarried o=\r\nne can realise the Self, because the Self is here and\nnow.=94 -- Talks 17\n\n=\r\n=93How does a grihasta fare in the scheme of Moksha?=94 Bhagavan: =93Why do=\r\n you\nthink yourself to be a grihasta? If you go out as a sannyasi, the thou=\r\nght\nthat you are a sannyasi will haunt you. You will be only substituting o=\r\nne\nthought by another. The mental obstacles are always there. They even\ninc=\r\nrease in new surroundings. There is no help in the change of environment.\nT=\r\nhe mind is the obstacle. Therefore why change the environment?=94 -- Talks =\r\n54\n\n=93Is the world perceived after Self-realisation?=94 Bhagavan: =93What =\r\ndoes it\nmatter if the world is perceived or not? The ajnani sees the Jnani =\r\nactive\nand is confounded. The world is perceived by both; but their outlook=\r\ns\ndiffer. Take the cinema, for instance. Pictures move on the screen. Let t=\r\nhe\npictures disappear. What remains? The screen alone. So also here. Even w=\r\nhen\nthe world appears find out to whom it appears. Hold the substratum of t=\r\nhe\n=91I=92. When the substratum is held what does it matter if the world ap=\r\npears or\ndisappears?=94 -- Talks 65\n\n=93How to turn the mind away from the =\r\nworld, you say? Is there a world apart\nfrom the Self? Does the world say th=\r\nat it exists. It is you who say that\nthere is a world.Find out the Self who=\r\n says it.=94 -- Talks 81\n\n=93You say that the world is materialistic. Wheth=\r\ner it is materialistic or\nspiritual, it is according to your outlook. Make =\r\nyour outlook right. The\nCreator knows how to take care of His creation.=94 =\r\n-- Talks 240\n\n=93Does Bhagavan believe in evolution?=94 Bhagavan: =93Evolut=\r\nion must be from one\nstate to another When differences are not admitted, ho=\r\nw can evolution arise?\nYou say that when Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that afte=\r\nr several births the\nseeker gains knowledge and thus knows =93Me=94, denote=\r\ns evolution. But you must\nnot forget that the Gita begins with =93Neither I=\r\n was, nor you, nor these\nchiefs, etc.=94; =93neither it is born, nor does i=\r\nt die, etc.=94 So there is no\nbirth, no death, no present as you look at it=\r\n. Reality was, is, and will\nalways be. It is changeless.=94 -- Talks 264\n\n=\r\n=93What should we do to ameliorate the condition of the world?=94 Bhagavan:=\r\n =93If\nyou are free from pain, there will be no pain anywhere. The trouble =\r\nis due\nto your seeing the world externally and also thinking that it has pa=\r\nin. But\nboth the pain and the world are within you. If you look within ther=\r\ne will be\nno pain.=94 -- Talks 272\n\n=93A phenomenon cannot be a reality sim=\r\nply because it serves a purpose. Dreams\nalso serve dream purposes; for exam=\r\nple, the dream water quenches dream\nthirst. The dream creation is however c=\r\nontradicted in the waking state. What\nis not continuous cannot be real. The=\r\n real is ever real, and not real once\nand unreal at other times. The same i=\r\ns with magic, which appears real yet it\nis illusory. Similarly the world is=\r\n not real apart from the reality which\nunderlies it.=94 -- Talks 315\n\n=93Th=\r\nere is fire on the screen in a cinema show: does it burn the screen?\nThere =\r\nis a cascade of water: does it wet the screen? There are tools: do\nthey dam=\r\nage the screen? Fire and water are only phenomena on the screen of\nBrahman =\r\nand do not affect it.=94 -- Talks 316\n\nA Spanish lady writes in a letter: =\r\n=93If the individual self merges in the\nuniversal Self, how can we pray to =\r\nGod for the uplift of humanity?=94 Bhagavan\ncomments: =93They pray to God a=\r\nnd finish with, =91Thy will be done.=92 If His will\nbe done why do they pra=\r\ny at all? It is true that the Divine will prevails at\nall times and under a=\r\nll circumstances. The individuals cannot act of their\nown accord. Recognise=\r\n the force of the Divine will and keep quiet. Each one\nis looked after by G=\r\nod. He has created all. You are among 2,000 millions.\nWhen He looks after s=\r\no many will He omit you? =93Again there is no need to let\nHim know your nee=\r\nds. He knows them Himself and will look after them.=94 --\nTalks 594\n\n=93Sti=\r\nll more, why do you pray? Does not your Creator and Protector know that\nyou=\r\n are weak? You say God helps those who help themselves. Certainly, help\nyou=\r\nrself and that is itself according to God=92s will. Every action is\nprompte=\r\nd by Him only. As for prayers for others it looks so unselfish on the\nsurfa=\r\nce of it. But analyse the feeling and you will detect selfishness there\nals=\r\no. You desire others=92 happiness so that you may be happy. Or you want the=\r\n\ncredit for having interceded on others=92 behalf.God does not require\ninte=\r\nrmediaries. Mind your business and all will be well.=94 -- Talks 594\n\n=93Do=\r\nes not God work His will through some chosen person?=94 Bhagavan: =93God is=\r\n\nin all and works through all. But His presence is better recognised in\npur=\r\nified minds. The pure one reflects God=92s actions more clearly than the\nim=\r\npure mind. Therefore people say that they are the chosen ones. But the\nchos=\r\nen man does not himself say so. If he thinks that he is the\nintermediary, t=\r\nhen it is clear that he retains his individuality and that\nthere is no comp=\r\nlete surrender.=94 -- Talks 594\n\n=93Are not the Brahmins considered to be t=\r\nhe priests or intermediaries between\nGod and others?=94 Bhagavan: =93Yes, b=\r\nut who is a Brahmin? A Brahmin is one who\nhas realised Brahman. Such an one=\r\n has no sense of individuality in him. He\ncannot think that he acts as an i=\r\nntermediary.=94 -- Talks 594\n\n=93The mind is like akasa (ether of space). J=\r\nust as there are objects in\nspace, so there are thoughts in the mind.... On=\r\ne cannot hope to measure the\nuniverse and study the phenomena. It is imposs=\r\nible. For the objects are\nmental creation; it is like trying to stamp with =\r\none=92s foot on the head of\none=92s shadow; the farther one moves the farth=\r\ner goes the shadow=92s head.=94 --\nTalks 485\n\n\n=93Look how every person bel=\r\nieves in his own existence. Does he look in the\nmirror to see his being? Hi=\r\ns awareness of his existence gives him the\nassurance of it. But he compares=\r\n it with the body, etc. Why should he do\nthat? Is he aware of his body in s=\r\nleep? He is not, yet he does not cease to\nexist while in sleep. He has ther=\r\nefore only to be aware of his being and\nthis will be evident to him.=94 -- =\r\nTalks 363\n\n=93You speak of the vision of Siva. Vision is always of an objec=\r\nt, which\nimplies the existence of the subject.Whatever appears must also di=\r\nsappear. A\nvision can never be eternal. But Siva is eternal. He is the cons=\r\nciousness.\nHe is the Self.=93TO BE is to realise =97 hence I AM THAT I AM. =\r\nI AM is Siva.\nNothing can be without Him. Therefore enquire =91Who am I?=92=\r\n Sink deep and\nabide as the Self. That is Siva as BEing.Do not expect to ha=\r\nve visions of\nHim.=94 -- Talks 450\n\n=93There is no being who is not conscio=\r\nus and therefore who is not Siva. Not\nonly he is Siva but also all else. Ye=\r\nt he thinks in sheer ignorance that he\nsees the universe in diverse forms. =\r\nBut if he sees the Self he will not be\naware of his separateness from the u=\r\nniverse. Siva is then seen as the\nuniverse. But (unfortunately) the seer do=\r\nes not see the background. Think of\nthe man who sees only the cloth and not=\r\n the cotton of which it is made, or\nthe pictures and not the screen; or the=\r\n letters which he reads and not the\npaper on which they are written. Siva i=\r\ns both the Being assuming the forms\nin the universe as well as the consciou=\r\nsness that sees them. That is to say\nSiva is the background underlying both=\r\n the subject and the object =97 Siva in\nrepose and Siva in action. Whatever=\r\n it is said to be, it is only\nConsciousness, whether in repose or in action=\r\n.=94 -- Talks 450\n\n=93The Cosmic Mind, being not limited by the ego, has no=\r\nthing separate from\nitself and is therefore only aware. This is what the Bi=\r\nble means by =91I am\nthat I Am=92.=94 -- Talks 187\n\n=93There is the peacefu=\r\nl mind which is the supreme. When the same becomes\nrestless, it is afflicte=\r\nd by thoughts. Mind is only the dynamic power\n(shakti) of the Self. There i=\r\ns no difference between matter and spirit.\nModern science admits that all m=\r\natter is energy. Energy is power or force\n(shakti). Therefore all are resol=\r\nved in Siva and Shakti, i.e., the Self and\nthe Mind.=94 -- Talks 268\n\n=93Sh=\r\nould I meditate on the right chest in order to meditate on the Heart?=94\nBh=\r\nagavan: =93The Heart is not physical. Meditation should not be on the right=\r\n\nor the left. It should be on the Self. Everyone knows =93I am=94. It is ne=\r\nither\nwithin nor without, neither on the right nor the left: =91I am=92 =97=\r\n that is\nall.=94 -- Talks 273\n\n=93The silence of solitude is forced. Restra=\r\nined speech in society amounts to\nsilence. For the man then controls his sp=\r\neech. If the speaker is engaged\notherwise speech becomes restrained. Introv=\r\nerted mind is otherwise active\nand is not anxious to speak.=94 -- Talks 60\n=\r\n\nBhagavan says that going to places of solitude for the purpose of\ncultivat=\r\ning the habit of silence is not of much value; for it is a forced\nstate for=\r\n lack of company; whereas control of the tongue in society is true\nsilence,=\r\n and thus true self-control.\n\n=93Mouna as a disciplinary measure is meant f=\r\nor limiting the mental activities\ndue to speech. If the mind is otherwise c=\r\nontrolled disciplinary mouna is\nunnecessary. For mouna becomes natural.=94 =\r\n-- Talks 60\n\nNote: Why do sadhakas cultivate silence? In order to silence t=\r\nhe mind. But\nthis is holding the stick by the wrong end; for it is not spee=\r\nch that causes\nthinking, but thinking that causes speaking. Conversation, n=\r\no doubt,\nprovokes thinking and therefore talking, but if the mind has not b=\r\neen\nbrought under control, even if there is no one to talk to, the mind wil=\r\nl\ntalk to itself; memory in particular will surge up and will fill the mind=\r\n\nwith thoughts of the dead past. The mind in solitude will then be in a far=\r\n\nworse condition than in society. Memory is a more dangerous companion than=\r\n\nthe society of sattvic friends, who may sometimes talk on irrelevant\nmatte=\r\nrs, but this may prove a help to the sadhaka,in that it serves to break\nhis=\r\n brooding over a chain of unhappy events which are dead and gone, and\nwhose=\r\n resuscitation may depress the mind, which he endeavours to keep\ncheerful f=\r\nor the sake of a successful sadhana.\n\n=93When Sita was asked by the wives o=\r\nf the Rishis who was her husband among\nthe then assembled Rishis in the for=\r\nest, she denied each one as he by turn\nwas pointed to her, but simply speec=\r\nhlessly hung down her head when Rama\nhimself was pointed out. Her silence w=\r\nas eloquent. The Vedas are similarly\neloquent in =91Neti=92, =91Neti=92 (=\r\n=91not this=92, =91not this=92) and then remain silent.\nTheir silence is th=\r\ne Real state. This is the meaning of teaching through\nsilence.When the sour=\r\nce of the =91I=92-thought is reached, it vanishes and what\nremains over is =\r\nthe Self.=94 -- Talks 130\n\n=93Mouna is not closing the mouth. It is the sta=\r\nte which transcends speech and\nthought. Hold some concept firmly and trace =\r\nit back. By such concentration\nsilence results. When practice becomes natur=\r\nal it will end in silence.\nMeditation without mental activity is silence.=\r\n=94 -- Talks 231\n\n=93Does distance have any effect on Grace?=94 asks the Am=\r\nerican visitor, and Sri\nBhagavan answers: =93Time and space are within you.=\r\n You are always the Self\nyou are seeking. How do time and space affect it?=\r\n=94 -- Talks 127\n\n=93How to transcend the mind?=94 The Master answers: =93M=\r\nind is by nature\nrestless. Begin liberating it from its restlessness: give =\r\nit peace; make it\nfree from distractions; train it to look inward; make thi=\r\ns a habit. This is\ndone by ignoring the external world and removal of the o=\r\nbstacles to the\npeace of mind.=94 -- Talks 26\n\n=93External contacts =97 con=\r\ntacts with objects other than itself =97 make the mind\nrestless. Loss of in=\r\nterests in the not-Self (vairagya) is the first step.\nThen the habits of in=\r\ntrospection and concentration follow, ending in\nsamadhi.=94 -- Talks 26\n\n=\r\n=93An examination of the ephemeral nature of the external phenomena leads t=\r\no\nvairagya. Hence enquiry is the first and foremost step to be taken, which=\r\n\nwill result in contempt for wealth, fame, ease, pleasure, etc. The =91I=92=\r\n-\nthought becomes clearer for inspection.=94 -- Talks 27\n\n=93If, however, t=\r\nhe aspirant is not temperamentally suited to the vichara\nmarga, he must dev=\r\nelop bhakti (devotion) to an Ideal =97 maybe God, Guru,\nHumanity in general=\r\n,ethical laws, or even the idea of Beauty. When one of\nthese has taken poss=\r\nession of the individual, other attachments grow weaker\nand dispassion (vai=\r\nragya) develops. Thus ekagrata (concentration) grows\nsimultaneously and imp=\r\nerceptibly.\n\n=93In the absence of vichara and bhakti, control of breath (pr=\r\nanayama) may be\ntried. This is known as Yoga marga. If the breath is held t=\r\nhe mind cannot\njump at its pets =97 the objects. Thus there is rest for the=\r\n mind so long as\nthe breath is held.

Just as a man who has been robbed=\r\n and\nblindfolded by robbers and thrown in a jungle enquires his way and ret=\r\nurns\nhome, so also the ajnani who is blinded by ignorance enquires his way =\r\nfrom\nthe Jnani and returns to his source.=94 -- Talks 108\n\n=93Please help m=\r\ne to realise the Self. It is no use reading books.=94 Bhagavan\nanswers, =93=\r\nQuite so. If the Self be found in books, it would have been\nrealised long a=\r\ngo.

Of course books have impelled the question.=94 -- Talks\n117\n\n=93H=\r\ne who instructs an ardent seeker to do this or that (work) is not a true\nma=\r\nster.

The expectation to see and the desire to get some=\r\nthing\nare all the working of the ego. You have fallen into the snare of the=\r\n ego,\nwhich says all this.

Buddhi or intellect is the\nthinki=\r\nng or discriminating faculty. But these are mere names. Ego, mind and\nintel=\r\nlect are all the same. Whose mind? Whose intellect? The ego=92s. Is the\nego=\r\n real? No. We confound the ego and call it intellect or mind.=94 -- Talks\n2=\r\n37\n\n=93To realise the Self effort is necessary. Just as water is got by bor=\r\ning\nwells, so also you realise the Self by investigation.=94 -- Talks 240\n\n=\r\n=93Meditation is sticking to one thought. That single thought keeps away ot=\r\nher\nthoughts; distraction of mind is a sign of its weakness. By constant\nme=\r\nditation it gains strength, i.e., weakness of fugitive thoughts gives\nplace=\r\n to the enduring background free from thoughts. This expanse devoid of\nthou=\r\nghts is the Self.

We look =\r\naround this\nmagnificent world of diversity and desire the things which impr=\r\ness us most,\nand so do our best to obtain them.We sacrifice a lot and suffe=\r\nr any amount\nof inconvenience for the sake of the desired object till we ge=\r\nt it. Yet our\ntrouble does not end with this acquisition, for new aims and =\r\nobjects rise\nbefore us and lure us into new desires and what we call new ne=\r\neds, for which\nwe have again to exert and again to suffer; and so on and on=\r\n endlessly. Thus\nwe remain bound hand and foot to the world without rest an=\r\nd without\nsatisfaction. But the Jnani, having cultivated and achieved desir=\r\nelessness,\nhas not the least interest in the world around him, so that his =\r\nperceptions\ndo not leave any impression on his mind. Even if he evinces an =\r\ninterest in\nan object it is only one of curiosity, much like that of a chil=\r\nd in its\nsurroundings, which passes away the moment it turns its back on th=\r\nem.\n\n=93A Self-realised being cannot help benefiting the world His very exi=\r\nstence\nis the highest good.=94 -- Talks 210\n\nNote: This should satisfy thos=\r\ne who criticise the Jnani as a useless\nascetic, should they be fortunate en=\r\nough to read it.The wisdom that flows\nfrom his lips and the purity of his l=\r\nife and conduct stand as shining ideals\nfor humanity to emulate, or aspire =\r\nfor, which no amount of preaching\nSocialism,Communism and philanthropy can =\r\ndo. What has all this preaching\ncreated except more antagonism, more divisi=\r\nons,more jealousy, and thus more\nhatred in the world. If these preachers re=\r\nally mean well and are sincere,\nthey should turn into true ascetics and bec=\r\nome Saints themselves and see the\ndifference between their old preaching an=\r\nd the good they can do with their\nholiness and purity by their mere presenc=\r\ne.

Hold it without sleeping or without all=\r\nowing thoughts to\npossess you. If that is held firm it does not matter even=\r\n though the world\nis seen. The seer remains unaffected by the phenomena. (T=\r\nalks, 196).\n\nYour duty is to be; and not to be this or that. =91I AM THAT I=\r\n AM=92 sums up the\nwhole truth. The method is, summed up in =91BE STILL=92.=\r\n What does stillness\nmean? It means =91destroy yourself =92. Because any fo=\r\nrm or shape is the cause\nof trouble. Give up the notion =91I am so and so=\r\n=92. (Talks, 363).\n\nIt is in the mind that birth and death, pleasure and pa=\r\nin,in short, the\nworld and ego, exist. If the mind is destroyed all else ar=\r\ne destroyed too.\nNote that it should be annihilated, not just made latent. =\r\nFor the mind is\ndormant in sleep. It does not know anything. Still, on waki=\r\nng up you are as\nyou were before.There is no end of grief. But if the mind =\r\nbe destroyed the\ngrief will have no background and will disappear along wit=\r\nh the mind.\n(Talks, 195).\n\n=91Be still and know that I am God=92. To be sti=\r\nll is not to think. Know, and\nnot think, is the word! (Talks, 131).\n\nSolitu=\r\nde is in the mind of man. One might be in the thick of the world and\nmainta=\r\nin serenity of mind; such a one is in solitude. Another may stay in\nthe for=\r\nest but still be unable to control his mind. He cannot be said to be\nin sol=\r\nitude. Solitude is a function of the mind. A man attached to desire\ncannot =\r\nget solitude wherever he many be; a detached man is always in\nsolitude. (Ta=\r\nlks, 20).\n\nJnana-marga and bhakti-marga are one and the same. Selfsurrender=\r\n leads to\nrealisation just as enquiry does. Complete self-surrender means t=\r\nhat you\nhave no further thought of =91I=92.Then all your vasanas are washed=\r\n off and you\nare free. You should not continue as a separate entity at the =\r\nend of either\ncourse. (Talks, 31).\n\nDvaita and Advaita are relative terms. =\r\nThey are based on the sense of\nduality. The Self is as It is. There is neit=\r\nher dvaita nor advaita, I AM\nTHAT I AM. Simple Be-ing is the Self. (Talks, =\r\n433).\n\nThe Self is known to everyone but not clearly. You always exist. The=\r\n Be-ing\nis the Self. =91I am=92 is the name of God. Of all the definitions =\r\nof God, none\nis indeed so well put as the Biblical statement =91I am that I=\r\n am=92 in Exodus\n3, Verse 14. None is so direct as the name JEHOVAH... I AM=\r\n. The Absolute\nBe-ing is what is... It is the Self. It is God. Knowing the =\r\nSelf, God is\nknown. In fact God is none other than the Self. (Talks, 106).\n=\r\n\nThe Bible says =91Be still and know that I am God=92.Stillness is the sole=\r\n\nrequisite for the realisation of the Self as God. (Talks, 338).\n\nBut men w=\r\nant absolute and permanent happiness. This does not reside in\nobjects, but =\r\nin the Absolute. It is Peace, free from pain and pleasure... it\nis a neutra=\r\nl state. (Talks, 28).\n\nNirvana is Perfection. In the Perfect State there is=\r\n neither subject nor\nobject; there is nothing to see, nothing to feel,nothi=\r\nng to know. Seeking\nand knowing are the functions of the mind. In Nirvana t=\r\nhere is nothing but\nthe blissful pure consciousness =91I am=92.

Such happiness is relative and is better c=\r\nalled pleasure. But we want absolute and permanent happiness. This does not=\r\n reside in objects but in the Absolute.

Until it is realised, effort is nec=\r\nessary. (This is the state of samadhi, which is blissful). After tasting su=\r\nch bliss even once, one will repeatedly try to regain it. Having once exper=\r\nienced the bliss of peace, no one would like to be out of it, or engage him=\r\nself otherwise. It is as difficult for the Jnani to engage in thought as it=\r\n is for an ajnani to be free from thought.

It is true that the Divine will prevail=\r\ns at all times and under all circumstances. The individuals cannot act of t=\r\nheir own accord. Recognise the force of the Divine will and keep quiet. Eac=\r\nh one is looked after by God. He has created all. You are among 2,000 milli=\r\nons. When He looks after so many will He omit you? =93Again there is no nee=\r\nd to let Him know your needs.

Does not your Creator and Protector know that you =\r\nare weak? You say God helps those who help themselves. Certainly, help your=\r\nself and that is itself according to God=92s will. Every action is prompted=\r\n by Him only. As for prayers for others it looks so unselfish on the surfac=\r\ne of it. But analyse the feeling and you will detect selfishness there also=\r\n. You desire others=92 happiness so that you may be happy. Or you want the =\r\ncredit for having interceded on others=92 behalf.God does not require inter=\r\nmediaries.

But His presence is better rec=\r\nognised in purified minds. The pure one reflects God=92s actions more clear=\r\nly than the impure mind. Therefore people say that they are the chosen ones=\r\n. But the chosen man does not himself say so. If he thinks that he is the i=\r\nntermediary, then it is clear that he retains his individuality and that th=\r\nere is no complete surrender.=94 -- Talks 594&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93Are not the Brahm=\r\nins considered to be the priests or intermediaries between God and others?=\r\n=94 Bhagavan: =93Yes, but who is a Brahmin? A Brahmin is one who has realis=\r\ned Brahman. Such an one has no sense of individuality in him.

Just as ther=\r\ne are objects in space, so there are thoughts in the mind.... One cannot ho=\r\npe to measure the universe and study the phenomena. It is impossible. For t=\r\nhe objects are mental creation; it is like trying to stamp with one=92s foo=\r\nt on the head of one=92s shadow; the farther one moves the farther goes the=\r\n shadow=92s head.=94 -- Talks 485&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=93Look how every per=\r\nson believes in his own existence. Does he look in the mirror to see his be=\r\ning? His awareness of his existence gives him the assurance of it. But he c=\r\nompares it with the body, etc. Why should he do that? Is he aware of his bo=\r\ndy in sleep? He is not, yet he does not cease to exist while in sleep. He h=\r\nas therefore only to be aware of his being and this will be evident to him.=\r\n=94 -- Talks 363&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93You speak of the vision of Siva. Vision is alw=\r\nays of an object, which implies the existence of the subject.Whatever appea=\r\nrs must also disappear. A vision can never be eternal.

Noth=\r\ning can be without Him. Therefore enquire =91Who am I?=92 Sink deep and abi=\r\nde as the Self. That is Siva as BEing.Do not expect to have visions of Him.=\r\n=94 -- Talks 450&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93There is no being who is not conscious and the=\r\nrefore who is not Siva. Not only he is Siva but also all else. Yet he think=\r\ns in sheer ignorance that he sees the universe in diverse forms. But if he =\r\nsees the Self he will not be aware of his separateness from the universe. S=\r\niva is then seen as the universe. But (unfortunately) the seer does not see=\r\n the background. T&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;hink of the man who sees=\r\n only the cloth and not the cotton of which it is made, or the pictures and=\r\n not the screen; or the letters which he reads and not the paper on which t=\r\nhey are written.&lt;/span&gt;=A0Siva is both the Being assuming the forms in the =\r\nuniverse as well as the consciousness that sees them. That is to say Siva i=\r\ns the background underlying both the subject and the object =97 Siva in rep=\r\nose and Siva in action. Whatever it is said to be, it is only Consciousness=\r\n, whether in repose or in action.=94 -- Talks 450&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=93The Cosmic Mind, being not limited by the ego, has noth=\r\ning separate from itself and is therefore only aware.

When the same becomes restless, it=\r\n is afflicted by thoughts. Mind is only the dynamic power (shakti) of the S=\r\nelf. There is no difference between matter and spirit. Modern science admit=\r\ns that all matter is energy. Energy is power or force (shakti). Therefore a=\r\nll are resolved in Siva and Shakti, i.e., the Self and the Mind.=94 -- Talk=\r\ns 268&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93Should I meditate on the right chest in order to meditate=\r\n on the Heart?=94 Bhagavan: =93The Heart is not physical. Meditation should=\r\n not be on the right or the left. It should be on the Self. Everyone knows =\r\n=93I am=94. It is neither within nor without, neither on the right nor the =\r\nleft: =91I am=92 =97 that is all.=94 -- Talks 273&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93The silence o=\r\nf solitude is forced. Restrained speech in society amounts to silence. For =\r\nthe man then controls his speech. If the speaker is engaged otherwise speec=\r\nh becomes restrained. Introverted mind is otherwise active and is not anxio=\r\nus to speak.=94 -- Talks 60&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan says that going to places of =\r\nsolitude for the purpose of cultivating the habit of silence is not of much=\r\n value; for it is a forced state for lack of company; whereas control of th=\r\ne tongue in society is true silence, and thus true self-control.=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=93Mouna as a disciplinary measure is meant for limiting the mental activ=\r\nities due to speech. If the mind is otherwise controlled disciplinary mouna=\r\n is unnecessary. For mouna becomes natural.=94 -- Talks 60&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Why=\r\n do sadhakas cultivate silence? In order to silence the mind. But this is h=\r\nolding the stick by the wrong end; for it is not speech that causes thinkin=\r\ng, but thinking that causes speaking. Conversation, no doubt, provokes thin=\r\nking and therefore talking, but if the mind has not been brought under cont=\r\nrol, even if there is no one to talk to, the mind will talk to itself; memo=\r\nry in particular will surge up and will fill the mind with thoughts of the =\r\ndead past. The mind in solitude will then be in a far worse condition than =\r\nin society. Memory is a more dangerous companion than the society of sattvi=\r\nc friends, who may sometimes talk on irrelevant matters, but this may prove=\r\n a help to the sadhaka,in that it serves to break his brooding over a chain=\r\n of unhappy events which are dead and gone, and whose resuscitation may dep=\r\nress the mind, which he endeavours to keep cheerful for the sake of a succe=\r\nssful sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;=93When Sita was =\r\nasked by the wives of the Rishis who was her husband among the then assembl=\r\ned Rishis in the forest, she denied each one as he by turn was pointed to h=\r\ner, but simply speechlessly hung down her head when Rama himself was pointe=\r\nd out. Her silence was eloquent. The Vedas are similarly eloquent in =91Net=\r\ni=92, =91Neti=92 (=91not this=92, =91not this=92) and then remain silent. T=\r\nheir silence is the Real state. This is the meaning of teaching through sil=\r\nence.When the source of the =91I=92-thought is reached, it vanishes and wha=\r\nt remains over is the Self.=94 -- Talks 130&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93Mouna is not=\r\n closing the mouth. It is the state which transcends speech and thought. Ho=\r\nld some concept firmly and trace it back. By such concentration silence res=\r\nults. When practice becomes natural it will end in silence. Meditation with=\r\nout mental activity is silence.=94 -- Talks 231&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93Does distance h=\r\nave any effect on Grace?=94 asks the American visitor, and Sri Bhagavan ans=\r\nwers: =93Time and space are within you.

Be=\r\ngin liberating it from its restlessness: give it peace; make it free from d=\r\nistractions; train it to look inward; make this a habit. This is done by ig=\r\nnoring the external world and removal of the obstacles to the peace of mind=\r\n.=94 -- Talks 26&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93External contacts =97 contacts with objects ot=\r\nher than itself =97 make the mind restless. Loss of interests in the not-Se=\r\nlf (vairagya) is the first step. Then the habits of introspection and conce=\r\nntration follow, ending in samadhi.=94 -- Talks 26&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93An examinati=\r\non of the ephemeral nature of the external phenomena leads to vairagya. Hen=\r\nce enquiry is the first and foremost step to be taken, which will result in=\r\n contempt for wealth, fame, ease, pleasure, etc. The =91I=92- thought becom=\r\nes clearer for inspection.=94 -- Talks 27&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93If, however, the aspi=\r\nrant is not temperamentally suited to the vichara marga, he must develop bh=\r\nakti (devotion) to an Ideal =97 maybe God, Guru, Humanity in general,ethica=\r\nl laws, or even the idea of Beauty. When one of these has taken possession =\r\nof the individual, other attachments grow weaker and dispassion (vairagya) =\r\ndevelops. Thus ekagrata (concentration) grows simultaneously and impercepti=\r\nbly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93In the absence of vichara and bhakti, control of breath (p=\r\nranayama) may be tried. This is known as Yoga marga. If the breath is held =\r\nthe mind cannot jump at its pets =97 the objects. Thus there is rest for th=\r\ne mind so long as the breath is held. The mind improves by practice and bec=\r\nomes finer, just as the razor=92s edge is sharpened by stropping.=94 -- Tal=\r\nks 27&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=93If the origin is sat onl=\r\ny, why is it not felt?=94 Bhagavan: =93The salt in lump is visible, but inv=\r\nisible in solution; still it is cognised by its taste. Similarly sat (or tr=\r\nuth), though not perceived by the intellect is still realisable in other wa=\r\nys. How? Just as a man who has been robbed and blindfolded by robbers and t=\r\nhrown in a jungle enquires his way and returns home, so also the ajnani who=\r\n is blinded by ignorance enquires his way from the Jnani and returns to his=\r\n source.=94 -- Talks 108&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93Please help me to realise the S=\r\nelf. It is no use reading books.=94 Bhagavan answers, =93Quite so. If the S=\r\nelf be found in books, it would have been realised long ago. Is it not a wo=\r\nnder that we should seek the Self in books?

There is nothing to come down or manifest itself. What =\r\nis needed is losing the ego. That which is, is ever present. Even now you a=\r\nre It, and not apart from It. The blank is seen by you.

Because of the emergence of thoughts we surmise a thing from wh=\r\nich they start. That we term mind. When we probe to see what it is, there i=\r\ns nothing like it. Buddhi or intellect is the thinking or discriminating fa=\r\nculty. But these are mere names. Ego, mind and intellect are all the same. =\r\nWhose mind? Whose intellect? The ego=92s. Is the ego real? No. We confound =\r\nthe ego and call it intellect or mind.=94 -- Talks 237&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=93To reali=\r\nse the Self effort is necessary.

That single thought keeps away other thoug=\r\nhts; distraction of mind is a sign of its weakness.

The interes=\r\nt of the child in things ends with the things. These leave no impressions i=\r\nn the child=92s mind. The same is the case with the Jnani.=94 -- Talks 9&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Note: Desires are the cause of all our trouble. We look around this =\r\nmagnificent world of diversity and desire the things which impress us most,=\r\n and so do our best to obtain them.We sacrifice a lot and suffer any amount=\r\n of inconvenience for the sake of the desired object till we get it. Yet ou=\r\nr trouble does not end with this acquisition, for new aims and objects rise=\r\n before us and lure us into new desires and what we call new needs, for whi=\r\nch we have again to exert and again to suffer; and so on and on endlessly. =\r\nThus we remain bound hand and foot to the world without rest and without sa=\r\ntisfaction. But the Jnani, having cultivated and achieved desirelessness, h=\r\nas not the least interest in the world around him, so that his perceptions =\r\ndo not leave any impression on his mind. Even if he evinces an interest in =\r\nan object it is only one of curiosity, much like that of a child in its sur=\r\nroundings, which passes away the moment it turns its back on them.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=93A Self-realised being cannot help bene=\r\nfiting the world His very existence is the highest good.=94 -- Talks 210&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Note: This should satisfy tho=\r\nse who criticise the Jnani as a useless ascetic, should they be fortunate e=\r\nnough to read it.The wisdom that flows from his lips and the purity of his =\r\nlife and conduct stand as shining ideals for humanity to emulate, or aspire=\r\n for, which no amount of preaching Socialism,Communism and philanthropy can=\r\n do. What has all this preaching created except more antagonism, more divis=\r\nions,more jealousy, and thus more hatred in the world. If these preachers r=\r\neally mean well and are sincere, they should turn into true ascetics and be=\r\ncome Saints themselves and see the difference between their old preaching a=\r\nnd the good they can do with their holiness and purity by their mere presen=\r\nce.

Hold it without sleeping or without allowing =\r\nthoughts to possess you.&lt;/span&gt;=A0If that is held firm it does not matter e=\r\nven though the world is seen. The seer remains unaffected by the phenomena.=\r\n (Talks, 196).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Your duty is to be=\r\n; and not to be this or that. =91I AM THAT I AM=92 sums up the whole truth.=\r\n The method is, summed up in =91BE STILL=92. What does stillness mean? It m=\r\neans =91destroy yourself =92. Because any form or shape is the cause of tro=\r\nuble. Give up the notion =91I am so and so=92. (Talks, 363).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;It is in the mind that birth and death, pleasure and pain,in short, the w=\r\norld and ego, exist. If the mind is destroyed all else are destroyed too. N=\r\note that it should be annihilated, not just made latent. For the mind is do=\r\nrmant in sleep. It does not know anything. Still, on waking up you are as y=\r\nou were before.There is no end of grief. But if the mind be destroyed the g=\r\nrief will have no background and will disappear along with the mind.

Know, and not think, is the word=\r\n! (Talks, 131).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solitude is in the mind of man. One might be =\r\nin the thick of the world and maintain serenity of mind; such a one is in s=\r\nolitude. Another may stay in the forest but still be unable to control his =\r\nmind. He cannot be said to be in solitude. Solitude is a function of the mi=\r\nnd. A man attached to desire cannot get solitude wherever he many be; a det=\r\nached man is always in solitude. (Talks, 20).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Jnana-marga and bhak=\r\nti-marga are one and the same. Selfsurrender leads to realisation just as e=\r\nnquiry does. Complete self-surrender means that you have no further thought=\r\n of =91I=92.Then all your vasanas are washed off and you are free. You shou=\r\nld not continue as a separate entity at the end of either course. (Talks, 3=\r\n1).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Dvaita and Advaita are relat=\r\nive terms. They are based on the sense of duality. The Self is as It is. Th=\r\nere is neither dvaita nor advaita, I AM THAT I AM. Simple Be-ing is the Sel=\r\nf. (Talks, 433).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Self is known to everyone but not clea=\r\nrly. You always exist. The Be-ing is the Self. =91I am=92 is the name of Go=\r\nd. Of all the definitions of God, none is indeed so well put as the Biblica=\r\nl statement =91I am that I am=92 in Exodus 3, Verse 14. None is so direct a=\r\ns the name JEHOVAH... I AM. The Absolute Be-ing is what is... It is the Sel=\r\nf. It is God. Knowing the Self, God is known. In fact God is none other tha=\r\nn the Self. (Talks, 106).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Bible says =91Be still and know that=\r\n I am God=92.Stillness is the sole requisite for the realisation of the Sel=\r\nf as God. (Talks, 338).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But men want absolute and permanent happines=\r\ns. This does not reside in objects, but in the Absolute. It is Peace, free =\r\nfrom pain and pleasure... it is a neutral state. (Talks, 28).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Nirv=\r\nana is Perfection. In the Perfect State there is neither subject nor object=\r\n; there is nothing to see, nothing to feel,nothing to know. Seeking and kno=\r\nwing are the functions of the mind. In Nirvana there is nothing but the bli=\r\nssful pure consciousness =91I am=92.
