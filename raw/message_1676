It gives mastery &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; over the delusion of this universe and helps one come out of maya. Note that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Vishnu is the rishi for the middle part (madhyama charitra).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The beeja kliim is known as kaama beeja or desire seed. It helps overcome &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; desires and cleanse one. Note that Rudra is the rishi for the final part &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (uttara charitra).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://groups&quot;&gt;http://groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot;&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;/a&gt; group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://vedicastro&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro&lt;/a&gt;. home.comcast. net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yahoo.com&quot;&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 02, 2009 1:14 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: a question on Chandi Paath (Durga Saptashati)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes Prasad Bhai,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; as you mentioned, it is a samputa and there are many instances where this &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; concept is used. let us see if we can get opinion of some members having &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; knowledge of this.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@ &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste Utpal ji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    This is called &#39;samputam&#39; (Lit. meaning a covered box or enclosing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with folded palms as in anjali). The given mantra in this case is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; enclosed with praNava and respective beejakshara.
