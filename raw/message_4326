Therefore seek the\nroot-=E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99,question yourself =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99, find out its source. =\r\nThen all these\nwill vanish and the pure Self will remain over.

So the need for the investigation of the\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thou=\r\nght.\n(Talks, 139).\n\nThere is only one =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 all along; but wh=\r\nat rises up from time to time is the\nmistaken =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought; =\r\nwhereas the intuitive =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 always remains Self-shining,\ni.e.=\r\n, even before it becomes manifest.

They are absent in sleep, and =\r\nbefore seeing the\nobjective world, there is a state of awareness which is y=\r\nour pure Self. That\nmust be known (Talks, 311).\n\nSoul, mind and ego are wor=\r\nds. There are no real entities of the kind.\nConsciousness is the only truth=\r\n. (Talks, 245).\n\nJust on waking from sleep and before becoming aware of the=\r\n world there is\nthat pure =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=E2=80=94=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. =\r\nHold it without sleeping or without allowing thoughts to\npossess you. If th=\r\nat is held firm it does not matter even though the world\nis seen. The seer =\r\nremains unaffected by the phenomena. (Talks, 196).\n\nHow is the ego to be de=\r\nstroyed? Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to\nbe destroyed. Who ask=\r\ns this question? It is the ego. Can the ego ever agree\nto kill itself? This=\r\n question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to\nkill it. If you seek =\r\nthe ego you will find it does not exist. That is the\nway to destroy it.\n(Ta=\r\nlks, 615).\n\nYour duty is to be; and not to be this or that. =E2=80=98I AM T=\r\nHAT I AM=E2=80=99 sums up the\nwhole truth. The method is, summed up in =E2=\r\n=80=98BE STILL=E2=80=99. What does stillness\nmean? It means =E2=80=98destro=\r\ny yourself =E2=80=99. Because any form or shape is the cause\nof trouble.Giv=\r\ne up the notion =E2=80=98I am so and so=E2=80=99. (Talks, 363).\n\nThe ego is=\r\n like one=E2=80=99s shadow thrown on the ground. If one attempts to bury\nit=\r\n, it will be foolish. The Self is only one. If limited, it is the ego; if\nu=\r\nnlimited it is the Infinite and is the Reality. (Talks, 146).\n\n=E2=80=98I a=\r\nm that I am=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99 is God... not thinking, =E2=80=\r\n=98I am God=E2=80=99.Realise =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99\nand do not think =E2=80=\r\n=98I am=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Know I am God=E2=80=99... it is said, and not =\r\n=E2=80=98Think I am\nGod=E2=80=99. (Talks, 354).\n\nThe mind is by nature rest=\r\nless. Begin liberating it from its restlessness;\ngive it peace; make it fre=\r\ne from distractedness; train it to look inward;\nmake this a habit. This is =\r\ndone by ignoring the external world and removing\nthe obstacles to peace of =\r\nmind. (Talks, 26).\n\nIs it the mind that wants to kill itself? The mind cann=\r\not kill itself. So\nyour business is to find the real nature of the mind.The=\r\nn you will know that\nthere is no mind. When the Self is sought, the mind is=\r\n nowhere. Abiding in\nthe Self, one need not\nworry about the mind. (Talks, 1=\r\n46).\n\nMere book-learning is not of any great use. After realisation all\nint=\r\nellectual loads are useless burdens and are thrown overboard as jetsam.\nJet=\r\ntisoning the ego is necessary and natural. (Talks, 28).\n\nIt is in the mind =\r\nthat birth and death, pleasure and pain,in short, the\nworld and ego, exist.=\r\n If the mind is destroyed all else are destroyed too. Note\nthat it should b=\r\ne annihilated, not just made latent. For the mind is dormant\nin sleep. It d=\r\noes not know anything. Still, on waking up you are as you were\nbefore.There=\r\n is no end of grief. But if the mind be destroyed the grief will\nhave no ba=\r\nckground and will disappear along with the mind. (Talks, 195).\n\nThe mind is=\r\n only a bundle of thoughts. The thoughts arise because there is\nthe thinker=\r\n. The thinker is the ego. The ego, if sought, will vanish\nautomatically. Th=\r\ne ego and the mind are the same. The ego is the\nroot-thought from which all=\r\n other thoughts arise. (Talks, 195).\n\nTo imagine Muladhara at the bottom, t=\r\nhe Heart at the centre or the head at\nthe top or over all these is all wron=\r\ng. In one word, to think is not your\nreal nature. (Talks, 184).\n\nIs not =E2=\r\n=80=98I am=E2=80=99 also a thought?... The egoless =E2=80=98I AM=E2=80=99 i=\r\ns not a thought. It is\nRealisation. The meaning or significance of =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 is God. The experience of =E2=80=98I\nam=E2=80=99 is to =E2=80=\r\n=98BE STILL=E2=80=99. (Talks, 226).\n\nInward seeking is the path to be gaine=\r\nd by man=E2=80=99s intellect.The intellect\nitself realises after continuous=\r\n practice that it is enabled by some Higher\nPower to function. It cannot it=\r\nself reach this Power. So it ceases to\nfunction after a certain stage.Then =\r\nthe Supreme Power is still left there\nall alone. That is Realisation; that =\r\nis finality; that is the goal. (Talks,\n502).\n\nIt is thus plain that the pur=\r\npose of the intellect is to realise its own\ndependence upon the Higher Powe=\r\nr and its inability to reach the same. So it\nmust annihilate itself before =\r\nthe goal is reached. (Talks, 502).\n\nWhy is intellect developed? It has a pu=\r\nrpose. The purpose is that it should\nshow the way to realise the Self. It m=\r\nust be put to that use. (Talks, 644).\n\nThe mind becomes peaceful for a shor=\r\nt while and again emerges forth. What is\nto be done?... The peace often gai=\r\nned must be remembered at other times.\nThat peace is your natural and perma=\r\nnent state. By continuous practice it\nwill become natural. That is called t=\r\nhe =E2=80=98current=E2=80=99. That is your true\nnature.(Talks, 303).\n\nPeopl=\r\ne think that freedom (moksha) is somewhere yonder and should be sought\nout.=\r\n They are wrong. Freedom is only knowing the Self within yourself.\nConcentr=\r\nate and you will get it.
