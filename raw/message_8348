Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo\n&gt; \n&gt; To Priyank  Maharaj,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A little pointer,\n&gt; &quot;they do sadhana for all gods&quot;\n&gt; For all forms so=\r\nunds better, and I always prefer to do for one form\n&gt; first, paagal kutton =\r\nki tarah till that form runs after the devotee to\n&gt; perform worship because=\r\n now he/she can&#39;t afford to be away from the\n&gt; devotee. It becomes a play, =\r\na play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; understand.\n&gt; \n&gt; A little point =\r\nabout love these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; the sun, was doi=\r\nng homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; open field with no =\r\nshade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; was sweating profuse=\r\nly as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; sweat coming into his e=\r\nyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; me to hide so that you =\r\nare comfortable???\n&gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked hi=\r\nmself,\n&gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this ver=\r\ny\n&gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n=\r\n&gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; su=\r\nnbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; look=\r\n at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The man wa=\r\ns humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; because after al=\r\nl, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &quot;shine on, I love=\r\n &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; (That last line w=\r\nas a joke.)\n&gt; \n&gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in sum=\r\nmers we hate\n&gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is=\r\n so\n&gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him\n=\r\n&gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt;=\r\n breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; ex=\r\nist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; Hell, he bu=\r\nrns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet what =\r\ndo most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; births combi=\r\nned.\n&gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And\n=\r\n&gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; \n&gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doe=\r\nsn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just b=\r\necause she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What lo=\r\nve.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he=\r\n is in\n&gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rare=\r\nly met\n&gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god t=\r\no\n&gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt;=\r\n don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt;=\r\n I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; Well, =\r\nhe slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; mother wil=\r\nl decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; bata-oon ki =\r\nmujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; chahiye, apni=\r\n bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; quite a lot of peo=\r\nple I have met.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are sure t=\r\no get the one you\n&gt; love????\n&gt; You love then claim that somebody to be your=\r\ns, yeah right, another\n&gt; slap!!\n&gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;=\r\ns sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but d=\r\nare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will=\r\n be delivered, but then\n&gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big=\r\n enough to know whats\n&gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who j=\r\naane.  Rather my love\n&gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come =\r\nand tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (=\r\ngod) tells me first\n&gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i=\r\n already have that\n&gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; To top it all he says s=\r\nince he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; he say anything to his g=\r\nod? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; have surrendered, then it s=\r\nhould be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; mean you sit on your ass warmin=\r\ng it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; everything god will do, kyun bha=\r\ni bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; hui hai??\n&gt; \n&gt; Surrender is you do =\r\nyour duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; god&#39;s, the results are=\r\n &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; If you actually manage t=\r\no surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; counselor, believe you me=\r\n. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 2=\r\n5000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the greatest men, t=\r\nhe greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; always maintained be god&#39;s do=\r\ng. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; when he sees his master, that=\r\n is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; master , to bring him chicken, =\r\nor mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t=\r\n bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants ma=\r\nster, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with =\r\ngod, and what do we do?????\n&gt; We are never happy with what the master bring=\r\ns, because we were\n&gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar=\r\n\n&gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; \n&gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master ,=\r\n we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; then we claim to others , oh no no,=\r\n I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; If you only want him=\r\n, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; We are selfish dogs, a=\r\nlways SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; that masterji brings us=\r\n that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; blanket, that milk, but we r=\r\narely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; wag at his thought. Tails of g=\r\nreat dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; about the great dogs, and preten=\r\nd that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; nope. That is mental masturbation,=\r\n its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and the=\r\nn you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will=\r\n salute you.
