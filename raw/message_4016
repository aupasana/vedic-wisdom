These are Prana, Udana, samana, vyana, apana.=\r\n Out of these &#39;Prana vaayu&#39; helps in respiration. \n\n3) The air flowing in a=\r\nnd out of lungs during the process of repiration (Inhalation and exhalation=\r\n) is also called Prana vaayu. As this air is essential for life maintainanc=\r\ne\n\n4) Cool, clean and dustfree air which flows in morning. This is dustfree=\r\n, pollution free and is moist. Due to this, this is considered good for hea=\r\nlth. \n\nPrana:\n\n1) Life\n\n2) Some times it is also used for Prana-shakti. The=\r\n Physical and mental energy stored in our body. A type of this is termed as=\r\n spiritual energy.\n\n3) The Inhalation and exhalation process. \n\nIt is advis=\r\ned to wakeup in Brahmmuhurta ( roughly around 4:30 am, or about 30-45 minut=\r\nes before sunrise) Because of following reasons\n\n1) This time is believed t=\r\no be ruled by Devatas. So one gets the blessings of devatas in this time.\n\n=\r\n2) This time is believed to have saatvik energy. This purifies the mind.\n\n3=\r\n) This time air is dust free, clean and without pollution. This purifies th=\r\ne body.\n\n4) During this time All the doshas (Vaata-pitta and kapha) are in =\r\nbalanced proportion. So our body is healthy and free from diseases. Waking =\r\ntoo late will increase kapha in body and waking too early will increase vaa=\r\nta in body. very common problems like constipation, insomnia, depression, l=\r\naziness, low immunity, cold can be avoided and infact cured just by waking =\r\nup in this time\n\nfurther, During this time, the concentration of Oxygen is =\r\nnot so High that it will cause oxidation. For oxidation of cells, much high=\r\ner concentration is needed. \n\nAnd, the concentration of CO2 and O2 never fl=\r\nuctuate too much so that we have to worry about their concentration until a=\r\nnd unless the difference is more than 10% in case of CO2 and 20% in case of=\r\n O2. (These are approx figures). With in this range we will not even notice=\r\n any difference in our surroundings or any type of discomfort.\n\nI hope it h=\r\nelps.\n\nSorry for mistakes. \nRegards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami vivekanada explains that prana=\r\nyama is about controlling the prana -life force \n&gt; see his exact words in h=\r\nis book Raja yoga\n&gt; While touring USA he spoke about prana and Ether from V=\r\nedas\n&gt; he told space is filled with ether and ether can be turned into pran=\r\na and vice versa\n&gt; the news paper published it \n&gt; the famous scientist Tesl=\r\na saw this and wrote a letter to the Einstein couple\n&gt; the einstein couple =\r\ncontemplated on it and found the e=3Dmc2 formula of how matter can be conve=\r\nrted to energy and nuclear bomb was found\n&gt; so the world believes Einstein =\r\nfound the theory of relativity while it was truly embedded in Vedhas and Sw=\r\nami Vivekanda brought it to light to the world and the credit went to Einst=\r\nein\n&gt; do a internet search and you can find the Swamis publication in paper=\r\n archives\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: MUKESH SONI &lt;=\r\nmukesh_csp@...&gt;\n&gt; To: trivedijv@...; mahalaxmyey@...\n&gt; Sent: Mon, March 15,=\r\n 2010 2:23:56 PM\n&gt; Subject: Curiosity ???  #1: If U know, Share !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Pl find updated query. it is also posted at our yahoo group.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Prana=\r\nam!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Curiosity ##1:\n&gt; &gt;How more =E2=80=98Pran-Vayu=E2=80=99 blows in=\r\n =E2=80=98brama-moohrat=E2=80=99 ???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;I knew some facts through read=\r\ning books that- \n&gt; &gt;#:  More =E2=80=9CPran-Vayu=E2=80=9D blows in =E2=80=98=\r\nbrama-moohrat=E2=80=99 environment. \n&gt; &gt;#:  =E2=80=9Cgetup early=E2=80=9D h=\r\nas more beneficial to Mind body and soul. \n&gt; &gt;#:  =E2=80=9Cbrama-moohrat=E2=\r\n=80=9D period is known before 2 hours of sun-rise. \n&gt; &gt;#: =E2=80=9CPranvayu=\r\n=E2=80=9D means Oxygen.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;I also read - \n&gt; &gt;#: Oxygen is produce thro=\r\nugh =E2=80=9Cphoto-synthesis=E2=80=9D in presence of sun. \n&gt; &gt;#: Production=\r\n of oxygen done by Trees in day time only. \n&gt; &gt;#: More =E2=80=9CCarbon-diox=\r\nide=E2=80=9D is produce in night by trees. \n&gt; &gt;#: Less oxygen! less efficie=\r\nncy !!! \n&gt; &gt;#: Less =E2=80=9Coxygen=E2=80=9D in night, more =E2=80=9Ccarbon=\r\n-dioxide=E2=80=9D in night.\n&gt; &gt;    Because  there is no presence of sun !!!=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;So, how more =E2=80=98Pran Vayu=E2=80=99 !!! blows in=E2=80=98bra=\r\nma-moohrat=E2=80=99 ??? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;I am seeking answer, if anyone has informa=\r\ntion, please share with us.    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yours \n&gt; &gt;Mukesh Soni  \n&gt; &gt;________=\r\n________________________\n&gt;   \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  The INT=\r\nERNET now has a personality.
