He needs and deserves o=\r\nur help.&quot;\n\n- Dr. David Frawley (Oct. 14, 2007)\n\n\n\n\nThe Teachings of the Bha=\r\ngavad Gita\n\nThe one who controls the senses by the trained and purified min=\r\nd and\nintellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service is\nco=\r\nnsidered superior.

(3.09)\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\nQ=\r\nuestion from one of Dr. Morales&#39; students:\n\n\nNamaste,\n\nAs so many of us the=\r\nse days seem to be doing much of this work\nall at once, how do we structure=\r\n our spiritual practices to better\nfit in to this traditional model? Especi=\r\nally in the West, we tend to\nget a little overzealous about everything, alm=\r\nost looking at the\nSystem of Yoga as something to push through or conquer. =\r\nI think it\nis wonderful that we get so excited about our spirituality, but =\r\ndo we\nneed to slow down, back-up a little, and be on a more natural\n&quot;schedu=\r\nle&quot;? Or can we just be fully aware of the Four Ashramas and All\nthe Eight L=\r\nimbs of Yoga and continue to pursue each one sincerely and\nwith devotion re=\r\ncognizing this shift?\n\nMany thanks to Acharyaji Dr. Frank Morales.\n\nOm Shan=\r\nti,\n\nSita\n\n\n\n\nDr. Morales&#39; Answer:\n\n\nDear Sita,\n\nNamaste. It does seem that=\r\n there are an infinite number of demands\non our schedules today compared to=\r\n the past! People today are\nriddled with jobs, classes, active Internet liv=\r\nes, family, a barrage\nof information coming at us, etc., etc. To add Yoga, =\r\nmeditation and\na satisfying spiritual life on top of all this often seems p=\r\nretty\ndaunting.\n\nThe idea of spiritual life is ultimately one of balance. T=\r\nhe path of\nYoga teaches us that balance in all things is necessary to make\n=\r\nspiritual progress. In the Bhagavad Gita, for example, Sri Krishna\nsays:\n\n&quot;=\r\nOne can have no success in Yoga if one eats too much or eats too\nlittle. No=\r\nr can one be successful if one sleeps too much or does not\nsleep enough.&quot; (=\r\nB.G. 6:16)\n\nWe are meant to practice Yoga in a way that is healthy, realist=\r\nic,\nand conducive to advancement. Thus, we have to avoid extremes in our\nli=\r\nfe, and live our life in such a way that we can come to a happy\ncompromise =\r\nwith A) our sadhana (practice) and B) our duties in life.\n\nAs far as knowin=\r\ng where the line lies between balance and obsession,\nthat will vary in acco=\r\nrdance with the individual. A good indicator\nthat you may be over-extending=\r\n yourself in sadhana at the expense of\nthe other important aspects of your =\r\nlife is precisely when sadhana\nbegins to be seen as a burden rather than a =\r\njoy, and to produce\nanxiety rather than peace.\n\nWhen we are performing asan=\r\nas, for example, we know that we have\npushed our bodies too far when an asa=\r\nna has gone from being merely\nchallenging to being painful. At that point, =\r\nwe are being given a\nhint by our body that it is time to pull back a little=\r\n, and if we go\nfurther, we may end up injuring ourselves.\n\nIn the same way =\r\nthat we need to hear and respect what our body is\ncommunicating to us in as=\r\nana, we also need to hear what our inner\nself is telling us with our sadhan=\r\na practice. It is important always\nto challenge ourselves in a healthy and =\r\nprogressive manner. But if\nwe go beyond that fine line from challenge to un=\r\nhealthy extremes,\nthen we need to adjust ourselves accordingly and reassess=\r\n how much we\ncan do in accordance with our capabilities, the time we have, =\r\nour\nother demands in life, and our goal in spiritual practice.\n\nIf, on the =\r\nother hand, our problem is not just that we feel that\nwe&#39;re pushing ourselv=\r\nes too much spiritually, but that we actually\nwant to perform more sadhana =\r\nbut simply do not have the time, then\nthis is a different concern. This is =\r\nstill a matter of balance, but it\nis now one of a balance of priorities. In=\r\n this case, there are several\noptions that one can follow. These include: A=\r\n) reassessing just how\nimportant other specific, non-spiritual activities a=\r\nre to one&#39;s\nlife. Are there some activities =96 even just one or two =96 th=\r\nat can be\nput on hold or scaled down to give you more time? Can you take on=\r\ne\nless class, work a few less hours a week, or make some other minor\nadjust=\r\nments? B) Another course of action is maximizing the time you\ndo have, doin=\r\ng things more efficiently as much as is feasible.\n\nWhat spiritual practitio=\r\nners often find is that, interestingly, when\nwe take somewhat of a leap of =\r\nfaith and put our spiritual life first,\nwhat then happens is that the rest =\r\nof our life quite naturally\nbecomes more balanced and efficient. When we ma=\r\nke room in our lives\nfor meditation, Yoga, and spirituality in general, we =\r\nconsequently\nfind the energy, inspiration, focus, and determination to maxi=\r\nmize\nwhat we&#39;re doing in the rest of our lives.\n\nWhile the four ashramas (t=\r\nhe four successive stages of life in\nHinduism: a) student life, b) married =\r\nlife, c) retired life, d) a life\nof complete dedication to spirituality) ar=\r\ne certainly excellent guides\nas to how we should structure our lives in acc=\r\nordance with where we\nfind ourselves in the ashrama time-frame, as people l=\r\niving in the\nmodern world, we also have to make whatever adjustments are ne=\r\ncessary\ngiving thought to our present demands and lifestyles.\n\nFor many of =\r\nus, for example, we might be in the grihastha (married)\nstage, but also fin=\r\nd ourselves as students (brahmacharya). Or some\nmight be in the student sta=\r\nge, but also be married and having to work\nat least part time. So, ideally =\r\nwe are meant to follow one ashrama at\na time, but if we need to make some a=\r\ndjustments for our own situation,\nthat&#39;s fine.\n\nThe best way to see stages =\r\nand categories in Vedic culture (whether\nashramas, varnas, yugas, etc.) is =\r\nto see the boundaries between each\nto be somewhat fluid. Rather than seeing=\r\n such stages as strict,\ncompartmental categories where one ends and the oth=\r\ner abruptly\nbegins, the following might be a good analogy to understand the=\r\nse\nstages better:\n\nSuch stages are similar to the area between the land and=\r\n the sea on a\nbeach. While one can clearly distinguish land from water, at =\r\nthe\nsame time it is difficult to say exactly where one begins and the\nother=\r\n ends. In the same way, if we find ourselves clearly in one\nashrama, while =\r\nstill performing some duties of another ashrama out of\nnecessity, that&#39;s fi=\r\nne. Guidelines like ashrama are meant to enhance\nour spiritual life, and no=\r\nt hamper it.\n\nFor the eight limbs of Yoga, in the beginning stages we often=\r\n have no\nchoice but to incrementally add one limb after another over a peri=\r\nod\nof time=85again, mostly do to a lack of time in our lives. However, it\ni=\r\ns not the case that we need to perfect our practice of one limb\nbefore proc=\r\needing to another. Rather, we&#39;re meant ultimately to be\nfollowing all eight=\r\n limbs simultaneously =96 from Yama/Niyama to\nSamadhi.\n\nI hope this was hel=\r\npful. Take care.\n\nOm Shanti,\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\n\n\n____________=\r\n__________________________________\n\n\nAnnouncements:\n\n\n1.
