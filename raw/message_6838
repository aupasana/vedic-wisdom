BPHS as available to us today gives homas based on=\r\n Veda \nmantras, which is very good too.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; This is all=\r\n subjective talk.Can you define  &quot;purity&quot; or &quot;required \n&gt; purity&quot;?Without d=\r\nefining that ,marketing self Homams is a futile \n&gt; exercise.\n\nFirst, we are=\r\n not &quot;marketing&quot; anything. Everything needed is available \nfreely on the in=\r\nternet and one doesn&#39;t even need to register with us to \ndownload the mater=\r\nials. They can anonymously download and try out. I \nfind out that someone i=\r\ns doing it, only if they voluntarily send me a \nmail to tell me so or to as=\r\nk a question!\n\nSecond, the &quot;futile exercise&quot; has already enabled atleast 20=\r\n00 people to \ndo homam by themselves and so many people emailed me saying t=\r\nhey&#39;ve been \ndoing homam for a few months and see a lot of positive change =\r\nin \nthmselves.\n\nThird, whatever sadhana one does, homam or japam or service=\r\n to people or \nwhatever, internal purity is what enables it to work.\n\n*    =\r\n    *        *\n\nNow, regarding the definition of &quot;purity&quot;, well, it can be =\r\ndefined in \nmany ways. You said: &quot;one should remember bhagavad gita - Do yo=\r\nur duty \nwithout expecting anything in return&quot;. In other words, based on wh=\r\nat one \nsees as one&#39;s dharma, one should perform actions firmly (as though =\r\none \nis passionate about a particular end result), and yet absolutely \nprep=\r\nared to face any end result in the end (i.e. if the end result is \ndifferen=\r\nt from the goal, one doesn&#39;t become sad and thinks of what to do \nNOW). Suc=\r\nh a person is most effective and untouched by karma.\n\nI can define purity a=\r\ns the level at which the above principle guides \none&#39;s instincts, thoughts,=\r\n words and actions. Not just making lofty \nstatements to impress others, bu=\r\nt having enough self-control internally \nto always focus on the current act=\r\nion, do the best possible action and \nbe unaffected by the result in the en=\r\nd. How well one can follow that \nprinciple is a measure of how pure one is.=\r\n Other people may not be able \nto see how pure one is, but one&#39;s own consci=\r\nence does.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe catch is that the purer one is, one kn=\r\nows one&#39;s dharma (duty) \nclearer. Each person&#39;s dharma is different, based =\r\non one&#39;s debts from \nprevious lives and one&#39;s skills. Nature expects differ=\r\nent things from \ndifferent people. Knowing one&#39;s dharma is not easy. An imp=\r\nure and highly \nconditioned consciousness sees its dharma through the color=\r\ned glass of \nthat conditioning and sees it incorrectly. Nevertheless, if on=\r\ne keeps \nperforming best actions with nishkama (i.e. prepared for any end \n=\r\nresult), eventually one&#39;s conditioning drops, one becomes purer, one&#39;s \ncon=\r\nscience speaks louder and louder and one knows one dharma clearer and \nclea=\r\nrer.\n\nConditioning or vasana is what makes you like and dislike things, wan=\r\nt \nand avoid things/people etc. It is what makes it difficult to accept all=\r\n \nend results of actions equally. It is what makes it difficult to engage \n=\r\nin some actions.\n\nAs one does sadhana, one does not make much progress for =\r\na while. Once \none crosses a threshhold, one falls into the groove and star=\r\nts making \nprogress. One&#39;s dharma starts to become clearer and one&#39;s condit=\r\nioning \nstarts to drop.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Venkat Rao &lt;mail2venkyrao@...&gt; \n=\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranaam Narasimha ji\n&gt;\n&gt; Planetary kavachas are not prescribed b=\r\ny Parasara as a remedy.The BPHS \n&gt; book i have gives specific remedial meas=\r\nures for each planetary \n&gt; malevolence\n&gt;\n&gt;  (With advancing Kali yuga, know=\r\nledge has given way to ignorance in \n&gt; many religions and now finally in Hi=\r\nnduism too!

In the beginning, on=\r\ne may start with blind faith, but \n&gt; eventually one has to know by experien=\r\nce. Otherwise, it is not of much \n&gt; use. The problem in the world right now=\r\n is that there are many \n&gt; relgions led by people who have not experienced =\r\ngod in any manner and \n&gt; yet leading people. This has resulted in people fi=\r\nghting and killing \n&gt; in the name of god.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Anywa=\r\ny, coming back to your question, I did not say planetary kavachas \n&gt; are a =\r\nmuch. In fact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kavacham are \n&gt; better f=\r\nor most people. In fact, any prayer can protect one, if one \n&gt; does with en=\r\nough intensity for enough duration.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; I never sai=\r\nd or will say that doing a particular ritual or mantra is \n&gt; the only way t=\r\no solve a particular problem or to experience a \n&gt; particular aspect of god=\r\n. Just as one can reach a mountain top from \n&gt; various sides using various =\r\npaths, one can reach god using various \n&gt; paths. God is not elsewhere, but =\r\nwithin us. But, the conditioning \n&gt; accumulated thru many lives makes us lo=\r\nok at things with attraction \n&gt; and aversion and mind vibrates with attract=\r\nion, aversion, pride, \n&gt; shame, anger, jealosy etc. If mind becomes nearly =\r\nstill, one can be in \n&gt; bliss and the divine energy within expresses outsid=\r\ne. The goal of \n&gt; various relgions is to take the mind to that state.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhere are many ways to facilitate that. Chanting a sacred combinations \n&gt; of=\r\n syllables with a focused mind is one way. In my opinion, one can \n&gt; achiev=\r\ne one-pointedness of mind with any syllable combination. Mind \n&gt; achieving =\r\none-pointedness with any mantra and/or mental imagery is a \n&gt; good thing. B=\r\nut depending the mantra/imagery, a different kind of \n&gt; energy envelopes th=\r\nat focused mind, purifies it and affects it. It \n&gt; just so happens that man=\r\ny great realized yogis came on the blessed \n&gt; land of India and cataloged m=\r\nany mantras and imagery. In other \n&gt; religions also, many people have exper=\r\nienced one-pointedness of mind \n&gt; on a thought/imagery/sound combination an=\r\nd experienced divinity. A \n&gt; muslim can take a surah from Quran and meditat=\r\ne with it. In fact, some \n&gt; sufi saints did experience divinity like that. =\r\nAlso, there are paths \n&gt; other than meditation. Serving others and trying t=\r\no see god in all is \n&gt; a valid path too. Oneday, mind can experience god th=\r\nat way too.\n&gt;\n&gt; While other areas of the world had their share of realized =\r\nsouls, \n&gt; India had just too many of them. What is known today as Hinduism =\r\nhas a \n&gt; rich library of knowledge from their experiences and revelations. =\r\nOne \n&gt; can try a path that was traversed by others and is well-understood. =\r\nIt \n&gt; does not mean those on the other side of the mountain are doomed.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; doing homams or not doing homams or any other hin=\r\ndu worship method\n&gt;\n&gt; Japam and homam are not the monopoly of any religion =\r\nand not just \n&gt; &quot;Hindu worship methods&quot;. People who meditated with special =\r\nchants and \n&gt; experienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every p=\r\nart of \n&gt; the world and in every religion.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for homam, sacredness of =\r\nfire and the ability to connect to the \n&gt; divine faster when using fire, wa=\r\ns known to many religions. Not only \n&gt; Hindus, but native Americans worship=\r\nped god in fire, Zoroastrians did \n&gt; it, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some =\r\nBuddhists did it, some south \n&gt; Americans did it, some Scandinavians did it=\r\n, and so on. There are \n&gt; references in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac,=\r\n Jacob and Moses \n&gt; having worshipped god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:2=\r\n0 says &quot;And \n&gt; Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean=\r\n beast, \n&gt; and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the alta=\r\nr&quot;. \n&gt; The Korban Olah (&quot;whole offering&quot;) of Judaism, where a whole animal =\r\n\n&gt; was burnt in fire, is very similar to &quot;poornaahuti&quot; (whole offering) \n&gt; =\r\nof homam where a full coconut symbolizing head or ego is burnt in \n&gt; fire. =\r\nThe seven candles of minorah, an integral part of judaism, \n&gt; remind us of =\r\nthe seven tongues of Agni.\n&gt;\n&gt; New Testament refers to baptism with fire (b=\r\naptism is purification by \n&gt; sprinkling or dipping in holy water). John the=\r\n Baptist says, &quot;I indeed \n&gt; baptize you with water unto repentance, but He =\r\nwho is coming after me \n&gt; is mightier than I =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C He wi=\r\nll baptize you with the Holy Spirit and \n&gt; fire.&quot; (MATTHEW 3:11). Purificat=\r\nion with fire is superior to \n&gt; purification with water. Note that fire is =\r\nclubbed with Holy Spirit \n&gt; here. In Veda also, fire is used as a symbol of=\r\n Self.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many seekers in many religions achieved the ascension of individ=\r\nual \n&gt; consciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire. Wi=\r\nth \n&gt; advancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many \n&gt; =\r\nreligions and now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like \n&gt; su=\r\nb-period within Kali yuga is coming again.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, the under construction =\r\nwebsite http://FireYoga.net has some more \n&gt; information along these lines.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Twitte=\r\nr ID: @homam108\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Venkat Rao &lt;mail2venkyrao@&gt; \n&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Pranaam Narasimhaji,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In this world,population of Hindus a=\r\nre less compared to Muslims and \n&gt;&gt; there are people following different re=\r\nligion.Most of the other \n&gt;&gt; religion do not incorporate worshipping planet=\r\ns - be it  with \n&gt;&gt; -sincere worship or insincere worship or doing homams o=\r\nr not doing \n&gt;&gt; homams or any other hindu worship method.If that is the cas=\r\ne how do \n&gt;&gt; we see planets protecting them.Please do not answer this with =\r\nanswers \n&gt;&gt; like &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;fate&quot; as they are nothing but excuses since yo=\r\nur \n&gt;&gt; mail below claims to be very scientific and  result oriented for \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n performed actions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Eg-\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times ev=\r\neryday and does it for 40-60 \n&gt;&gt; days, then some kind of results can be exp=\r\nected.

Kavachas of various dei=\r\nties (or \n&gt;&gt; planets) are protective sheaths covering one&#39;s consciousness a=\r\nnd \n&gt;&gt; stopping harmful influences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Grahas (literal meaning: those wh=\r\no grasp or get hold of) give good \n&gt;&gt; and bad results by grasping one&#39;s con=\r\nsciousness and affecting it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each planet has positives and negatives,=\r\n in general and also based on \n&gt;&gt; the chart. If one chants the kavacha of a=\r\n planet many times, \n&gt;&gt; eventually a protective sheath is formed around one=\r\n&#39;s consciousness \n&gt;&gt; with the nature and energy of that planet. This will o=\r\nbviously offer \n&gt;&gt; protection that is consistent with the nature of that pl=\r\nanet, in \n&gt;&gt; general and in one&#39;s chart. But, please remember that reading =\r\nthe \n&gt;&gt; kavacha of any planet will NOT harm you. Even the kavacha of 8th lo=\r\nrd \n&gt;&gt; or 6th lord will not harm one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he=\r\n chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will \n&gt;&gt; protect one from loss of courage (3rd=\r\n), problems to shoulders (3rd), \n&gt;&gt; untimely death (i.e. loss of longevity/=\r\n8th), problems in anus/genital \n&gt;&gt; area (8th) etc. There may be other thing=\r\ns based on other factors like \n&gt;&gt; aspects, occupancy etc. Based on his inhe=\r\nrent nature, Venus may also \n&gt;&gt; protect in the matters of love, romance, cr=\r\neativity etc also. \n&gt;&gt; Bottomline is that the aspects of one&#39;s personality =\r\nthat the planet \n&gt;&gt; is conducive to will be protected by the planet&#39;s energ=\r\ny.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, bu=\r\nt \n&gt;&gt; no harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some \n&gt;&gt; as=\r\npects they want to protect and doing their kavacha will protect \n&gt;&gt; those a=\r\nspects.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor =\r\nof lagna \n&gt;&gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will=\r\n be to \n&gt;&gt; chant the kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; kavachas I have seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from \n&gt;&gt; SrimadBhaga=\r\nvatam) and Chandi Kavacha are the most potent kavachas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But please no=\r\nte that chanting a kavacha once or twice or even once or \n&gt;&gt; twice a day is=\r\n hardly sufficient. If one has enough purity already, \n&gt;&gt; most mantras work=\r\n right away. But most of us have very dense \n&gt;&gt; conditioning and the energy=\r\n of mantras gets dispersed. The energy of \n&gt;&gt; the planet/deity of the kavac=\r\nha we chant cannot form a sheath around \n&gt;&gt; us easily. It requires intense =\r\nsadhana for most people. If one chants \n&gt;&gt; a kavacha 10-30 times everyday a=\r\nnd does it for 40-60 days, then some \n&gt;&gt; kind of results can be expected. I=\r\nntense sadhana with any mantra is \n&gt;&gt; needed for most people to see some re=\r\nsults. Getting things done by a \n&gt;&gt; professional priest is also not that us=\r\neful, as there are very very \n&gt;&gt; few priests with the required purity, the =\r\nability to identify with \n&gt;&gt; your problem and the ability to transfer the e=\r\nnergy. For most people, \n&gt;&gt; the best solution is to learn and chant by them=\r\nselves.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotish=\r\nWritings\n&gt;&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 AM, monkeymonkeykin=\r\ng10 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I sincerely hope our moderator forgives=\r\n this question which I also \n&gt;&gt; posted on the jyotish forum...I am a bit un=\r\nclear about Kavacha for \n&gt;&gt; the planets.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, if a planet suc=\r\nh as Rahu is giving one to have problems \n&gt;&gt; during his dasha, would one re=\r\ncite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other \n&gt;&gt; &quot;counter-balancing&quot; planet that =\r\nwas strong in one&#39;s chart?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Raj\n\n"}}
