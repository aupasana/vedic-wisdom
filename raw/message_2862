Though their ability to think is highly restricted compared to us, th=\r\ney do have the ability and some amount of free will. For example, a cat tha=\r\nt has just been fed and not hugry at all may spot a mouse and either kill i=\r\nt or leave it. It is a decision that that cat makes.\n \nThe actions done by =\r\nexercising free will accumulate as the karma of an animal. However, these m=\r\nay usually be too small to not give a human birth. There is another point t=\r\no be made.\n \nThe karmas of an animal get intertwined with the karmas of ani=\r\nmals that it associated with during its lifetime (e.g. killing, being kille=\r\nd, raising children, mating etc). When an animal&#39;s next life is decided bas=\r\ned on all of its karmas, Nature finds a solution that enables a payback of =\r\nkarmas by all parties with intertwined karmas. Thus, a deer may be born as =\r\na fox and vice versa.\n \nAfter going through the cycle many times, an animal=\r\n&#39;s kaarmik path may cross with some human beings and it may get an opportun=\r\nity to be born as a human being.\n \nBTW, we should realize that some human b=\r\neings are actually not better than the stereotype of animals. They live for=\r\n eating, mating and other basic needs and do not use the thinking ability a=\r\nnd free will that much. Of course, such people may have been animals in man=\r\ny lives and recently born as human beings. The mental conditioning stays fr=\r\nom previous lives and slowly changes based on the latest life experiences a=\r\nnd lessons.\n \n2) Your actions are NOT governed by your past karmas. Instead=\r\n, the possible field from which you can *choose* your current actions is *l=\r\nimited* by your past karmas. Though past does not determine present, past d=\r\noes restrict present. Based on what one has done before, there is a strong =\r\nmental conditioning to do certain things and the &quot;forces of habit&quot; are diff=\r\nicult to tame. Even when one wants, the external circusmstances may make it=\r\n very difficult. When one exerts freee will to fight the &quot;forces of habit&quot; =\r\nand do something unselfish, dhaarmik and useful to others, one grows spirit=\r\nually and accumulates good karma. One slowly comes out of the grip of the f=\r\norces of habit by forming new habits.\n \nThis is a slow process, but it is s=\r\nomething that one has to start sometime.\n \nEvn in really bad situations, pe=\r\nople have several options, more than what they may think they have. However=\r\n, the forces of habit close their eyes to certain options and make them see=\r\n only certain options. If one fights the forces of habit by exerting free w=\r\nill, one may be able to see options one did not see before and do something=\r\n better than before.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n \n---- Girish &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namask=\r\naram Narasimhaji and all others as well,\n&gt; I had a very elementary question=\r\n on Karma for which I have not been able to get a satisfactory answer so fa=\r\nr. Request you to kindly answer them for me. I have read books on Vedanta a=\r\nnd Advaita but the answer still eludes me or may be I am not able to compre=\r\nhend the hidden meaning because of my limited knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Karma as d=\r\nefined in wiki &quot;Karma (Sanskrit: &#2325;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;  k=C2=A8=C2=\r\n=A2rma (help=C2=A1=C2=A4info), k=C2=A8=C2=A2rman- &quot;act, action, performance=\r\n&quot;[1]; Pali: kamma) in Indian religions is the concept of &quot;action&quot; or &quot;deed&quot;=\r\n, understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e=\r\n., the cycle called sa&#7747;s=C2=A8=C2=A1ra)&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If the soul is in the g=\r\narb of an animal, lets say a Dog or a cat or any other non human entity , w=\r\nhat karma can it do so that it can progress to the next level. I mean We hu=\r\nmans can understand what is good and what is bad, but animals lack the sixt=\r\nh sense (or atleast we think so) fail to differentiate this and hence what =\r\nis that they are supposed to do so that they perform their karmas to the be=\r\nst to go forward?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) If my actions are already governed by my past kar=\r\nmas then how do I justify the good and bad that I do? I mean whatever good =\r\nor bad that I do is already predefined . In such a case how can I be held a=\r\nccountable for a good or a bad deed? Because its the karma that is driving =\r\nme to do something. So this becomes a infinite loop. as Adi Shankara says i=\r\nn Bhaj Govindam , &quot;Punarapi jananam , punarapi maranam&quot;... there seems to b=\r\ne no way out of this\n&gt; \n&gt; Please forgive me for my ignorance but I felt I n=\r\need to get this very elementary query clarified .\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Girish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
