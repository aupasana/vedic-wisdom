This person was telling me about th=\r\ne 64 kalas. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, =\r\nbut let me try and reproduce whatever I could understand.\n=C2=A0\nHe showed =\r\nme an old diagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a cen=\r\ntre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of =\r\nthe 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; placed at various pla=\r\nces on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. \nHe said these 64 represent=\r\n 64 different kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born i=\r\nn this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of the=\r\nse Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this phy=\r\nsical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why=C2=A0he is purn=\r\na avatar.\n=C2=A0\nEven Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain ma=\r\nstery of one more then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going in=\r\nto other subtle realms. \n=C2=A0\nFor an ordianry person, even mastery (by ma=\r\nstery I mean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an e=\r\nxceptional feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nNow this 16/64 is theoritically=C2=A0the maximum knowledge of all as=\r\npects of=C2=A0the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Whic=\r\nh is roughly 1/4th. \n=C2=A0\nWhile talking about this, he was also trying to=\r\n explain to me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in =\r\nwhat degree should each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him=\r\n to be able to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he wa=\r\ns talking mostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which =\r\na=C2=A0 really spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained whet=\r\nher he had use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha tattwas&quot; of=\r\n this physical plane of existence. \n=C2=A0\nAnyway I know this may all sound=\r\n very jumbled up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limit=\r\nation of understanding. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n--- On=\r\n Tue, 11/11/08, Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Ram=\r\nakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of=\r\n Duality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today)\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com\nDate: Tuesday, 11 November, 2008, 11:33 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarasimha =\r\ngaru,\n=C2=A0\nNamaste.\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; When a being like Krishna is \n&gt;&gt; born with =\r\n16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \n&gt;&gt; When=\r\n a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \n&gt;&gt; th=\r\nings in the dual world that are impossible for others.\n\nI heard Kalas in th=\r\ne context of moon (moon phases).

Even great jnaanis are \noccasionally deluded by Her power. One can unders=\r\ntand unmanifested non-dual \nBrahman, but one cannot hope to understand the =\r\ndual world fully ever. She is \ncapable of deluding even the greatest sadhak=\r\na with a wrong idea as soon as \none ventures into duality. She can mislead =\r\n*anyone* on *anything*. What She \ndoes and why She does that is so difficul=\r\nt to fathom. The only way to deal \nwith Her is to surrender to Her power *f=\r\nully*.\n\n&gt; on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity\n\nBTW, though we a=\r\nre all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. \nIn the non-dual=\r\n field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we \nhave differe=\r\nnces due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what \nand how mu=\r\nch we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \nborn with=\r\n 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \nWhen a=\r\n being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \nthings =\r\nin the dual world that are impossible for others.\n\nRealizing the non-dual S=\r\nelf is something that is possible for anyone, but \nthere are limits imposed=\r\n on what things one can do in the dual world, based \non the force of previo=\r\nus conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one \n(non-dual) level and all ar=\r\ne different at another (dual) level.\n\nBut it is tough to know for sure what=\r\n one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic \npoint holds. But I just wanted to poin=\r\nt that all are not indeed the same. We \nshould be disinterested in knowing =\r\nwho is what, not because all are the \nsame, but because we have no surefire=\r\n way to know who is what.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=\r\nic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net=\r\n\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----=\r\n- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@nambisan. net&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n\n|| Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino =\r\nBhavantuh ||\n\nDoes it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will c=\r\nall him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devot=\r\nee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting =\r\nhim he was always talking\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by=\r\n day. There was a weekly\n&gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. H=\r\ne was singing devotional songs created\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping whi=\r\nle singing.

One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go thro=\r\nugh bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but=\r\n bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This w=\r\nas surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had so=\r\nme super\n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only.

My wife was annoyed and\n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?=\r\n&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such a hasty\n&gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Pa=\r\nramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta.

I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty deci=\r\nsion. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that M=\r\nr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test =\r\nhim before accepting him. I also decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediatel=\r\ny told my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never come=\r\n to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never\n&gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me w=\r\nhere I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nperfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it =\r\nis possible?

What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How=\r\n dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday =\r\nwas my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mornings to=\r\nday and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my bl=\r\nanket and told me that-=C3=A2?o Go to your friend=C3=A2?Ts\n&gt; &gt; house. He\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me.

This person was telling me about the 64 kalas. Not that I could unders=\r\ntand everything that he was telling me, but let me try and reproduce whatev=\r\ner I could understand.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He showed me an old dia=\r\ngram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre like a wh=\r\nirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64 kalas.=\r\n Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; placed at various places on the ci=\r\nrcle. At the centre was atmavidya. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He said these 64 represent 6=\r\n4 different kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born in =\r\nthis phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of these=\r\n Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this physi=\r\ncal body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why&nbsp;he is purna =\r\navatar.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna=\r\n purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16 would mean leaving the physic=\r\nal body and going into other subtle realms. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;F=\r\nor an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I mean perfected knowledge)=\r\n of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptional feat. Such a man is re=\r\ngarded as unique, genius, beyond words.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Now th=\r\nis 16/64 is theoritically&nbsp;the maximum knowledge of all aspects of&nbsp=\r\n;the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is roughly =\r\n1/4th. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While talking about this, he was also =\r\ntrying to explain to me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather ho=\r\nw and in what degree should each tattwa interact with a person in his syste=\r\nm for him to be able to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. T=\r\nhen he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age =\r\nat which a&nbsp; really spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascerta=\r\nined whether he had use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha ta=\r\nttwas&quot; of this physical plane of existence. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A=\r\nnyway I know this may all sound very jumbled up and incoherent, but thats e=\r\nntirely because of my own limitation of understanding. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; =\r\nFONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 11/11/08, =\r\nRamakrishna &lt;I&gt;&lt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOC=\r\nKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Ramakrishna &l=\r\nt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of D=\r\nuality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, 11 November, 2008, 11:33 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=\r\n=3Dyiv486352971&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadd=\r\ning=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Narasimha garu,&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&gt; Wh=\r\nen a being like Krishna is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anyt=\r\nhing* with the objects of the dual world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When a being like Sa=\r\ni Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; things in=\r\n the dual world that are impossible for others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I heard Kala=\r\ns in the context of moon (moon phases).

Even great jnaanis are &lt;BR&gt;occasionally deluded by Her power. One =\r\ncan understand unmanifested non-dual &lt;BR&gt;Brahman, but one cannot hope to un=\r\nderstand the dual world fully ever. She is &lt;BR&gt;capable of deluding even the=\r\n greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as &lt;BR&gt;one ventures into dualit=\r\ny. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She &lt;BR&gt;does and why She do=\r\nes that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal &lt;BR&gt;with Her is to =\r\nsurrender to Her power *fully*.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the other hand we are all a =\r\npart of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, though we are all part of the same Divinity, w=\r\ne are all not the same. &lt;BR&gt;In the non-dual field, we are all the same. But=\r\n, in the field of duality, we &lt;BR&gt;have differences due to previous vasanas\n=\r\n (conditioning) , which decide what &lt;BR&gt;and how much we can do within the d=\r\nual world. When a being like Krishna is &lt;BR&gt;born with 16 kalas, He can do *=\r\nanything* with the objects of the dual world. &lt;BR&gt;When a being like Sai Bab=\r\na is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;things in the dual worl=\r\nd that are impossible for others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Realizing the non-dual Self is som=\r\nething that is possible for anyone, but &lt;BR&gt;there are limits imposed on wha=\r\nt things one can do in the dual world, based &lt;BR&gt;on the force of previous c=\r\nonditioning. Thus, all are the same at one &lt;BR&gt;(non-dual) level and all are=\r\n different at another (dual) level.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But it is tough to know for sure=\r\n what one&#39;s caliber is.

This is an unbelievable experience that I&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writin=\r\ng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n exactly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am =\r\ngoing back to the period of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly =\r\nread this only when you are in religious mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post =\r\noffice near&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to=\r\n 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=C3=A2?Tt; I had friendship with some&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel=\r\n, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator=\r\n. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ra=\r\nmkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nabout&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a =\r\nweekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; gathering\n at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANG=\r\nA. He was singing devotional songs created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years ol=\r\nd. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seasho=\r\nre daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only a=\r\nbout Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he su=\r\nddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some gue=\r\nst have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; son&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go=\r\n now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surpri=\r\nse his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one anot=\r\nher incident he told me that there\n will be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed ab=\r\nout&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One da=\r\ny I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; told me n=\r\not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\npunctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship o=\r\nnly. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I=\r\n should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came.=\r\n It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n deeply from my heart to accept me as his =\r\nfollower and bestow his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day=\r\n morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwhile taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nwaking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morni=\r\nng that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev.=\r\n My wife was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me =\r\na lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decisi=\r\non?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Ca=\r\nlcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru sh=\r\nould be living one, who can guide us,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; u=\r\ns Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A=\r\ncharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD=\r\n--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments\n were right at her place as people=\r\n in general not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I=\r\n was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decisio=\r\nn. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I rem=\r\nember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ntheir disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee=\r\n, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You =\r\nhave also not seen him. He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\ne where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nwithin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my select=\r\nion for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it is possible?

What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ Ho=\r\nw dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours.
