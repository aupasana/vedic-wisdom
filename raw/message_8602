Especially the one\n&gt; &gt; which is modeled in th=\r\ne form of a bear, and claps its hands as soon as\n&gt; &gt; it is powered on. Its =\r\nhands hold two plates which strike each other ,\n&gt; &gt; the bear&#39;s eyes light u=\r\np as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we\n&gt; &gt; are ready to go.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Student : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other types also, like=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; when you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts operating, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating some cu=\r\nddly\n&gt; &gt; lines. It is loved by girls.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, exactly. You,=\r\n right now, are the teddy bear, which girls\n&gt; &gt; and everybody loves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Student : =85=85=85=85. the fuck?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : aww!! How cute , my=\r\n little child is thinking in terms of\n&gt; &gt; profanities. Do you know why you =\r\nare here?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : *thinks in mind about all the philosophical st=\r\nuff he has read,\n&gt; &gt; and knew this question was widely discussed and asked,=\r\n and thus becomes\n&gt; &gt; happy&quot;=85. why?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Because , somebody=\r\n fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave\n&gt; &gt; this fucking business aside f=\r\nor a moment. Lets go back to the\n&gt; &gt; discussion, the end of which will be v=\r\nery fun.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Don&#39;t twist my words, I said right now you are akin to a te=\r\nddy\n&gt; &gt; bear. You have been that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear =\r\nwho\n&gt; &gt; claps, basically all the battery powered toys earlier. In philosoph=\r\nical\n&gt; &gt; terms they are called &quot;births&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : How may I ask?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : What is your name?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Chaman Sharma ( na=\r\nme changed due to security & other humorous\n&gt; &gt; reasons)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher :=\r\n LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma\n&gt; &gt; as the bear (the battery p=\r\nowered toy) who claps and claps and claps,\n&gt; &gt; that &quot;I am Chaman Sharma, I =\r\nam a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old\n&gt; &gt; , i like this girl, I love =\r\nplaying sports, I live here, I read this, I\n&gt; &gt; hate that, I this, and I th=\r\nat&quot;, okay?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about hims=\r\nelf*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going to happen soone=\r\nr than\n&gt; &gt; later, do you know what happens or what that means?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stu=\r\ndent : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t die.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Very good, y=\r\nou have read that off of a book, ever realized it?\n&gt; &gt; Are you not afraid o=\r\nf death?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : No, I am not afraid of death.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The ligh=\r\nts turn off in the room, there is total darkness, for 5 minutes\n&gt; &gt; there i=\r\ns no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then a pair of deep\n&gt; &gt; red eyes=\r\n appear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voice ever asks Mr\n&gt; &gt; Chaman,=\r\n &quot;why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear is death, and only\n&gt; &gt; the l=\r\nights have gone out, I haven&#39;t even started with you yet, if you\n&gt; &gt; say yo=\r\nu are not going to die, then why so scared?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suddenly the lights t=\r\nurn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off,\n&gt; &gt; with Chaman shivering=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : You said you were not afraid.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : I nev=\r\ner meant it, like that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Then in what way did you mean it=\r\n? Take it as a lesson that\n&gt; &gt; practical stuff in this spirituality busines=\r\ns is far greater than all\n&gt; &gt; your books combined. You get lost while readi=\r\nng, you think you are\n&gt; &gt; different. To me you are no worse than the thousa=\r\nnd others I meet,\n&gt; &gt; in-fact they are better off without the texts you hav=\r\ne studied.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Agreed, but don&#39;t scare me like that. Again.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : I will, if you make such ridiculous claims again. Anyway=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; where were we? The death of the teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the te=\r\nddy\n&gt; &gt; remains, the outer shell remains, but teddy is dead. The outer shel=\r\nl is\n&gt; &gt; either buried or burnt, in essence done away with, because it is o=\r\nf no\n&gt; &gt; use. Right?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Right\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Wrong. Let=\r\ns get back to the toy. Consider this, when you\n&gt; &gt; remove the battery from =\r\nthe toy, what happens? The toy is literally\n&gt; &gt; useless, it can&#39;t clap, it =\r\ncan&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t do shit.\n&gt; &gt; Thus, at death, Mr Chaman,=\r\n you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s body. You\n&gt; &gt; never die, you are only the=\r\n battery powering this personality which\n&gt; &gt; leads to powering your body.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: How can you even=85=85\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Lets consider th=\r\nat you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.\n&gt; &gt; When you plug the batterie=\r\ns into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,\n&gt; &gt; without the battery the c=\r\nar is idle, but as soon as I put the battery\n&gt; &gt; in, the car goes=85=85.. b=\r\neep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : sits in silence kn=\r\nowing well that interrupting now will be the\n&gt; &gt; biggest mistake ever.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Teacher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it in=\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; lets say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a s=\r\nong,\n&gt; &gt; or acts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student :=\r\n Teddy is idle, literally useless.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. I=\r\nt was the same battery that powered the\n&gt; &gt; car, it was the same battery th=\r\nat powered the teddy bear, and it is the\n&gt; &gt; same battery that can power an=\r\ny toy, correct?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Correct\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : While the bat=\r\ntery is in the car, it believes itself to be the\n&gt; &gt; car. It believes &quot;yess=\r\nsss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm\n&gt; &gt; torque, top speed 320kmph, =\r\n4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my\n&gt; &gt; passengers seat, I am the=\r\n king baby, look at how hot I am&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: Oh dear god=85.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Teacher : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nuseless piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; believes itself to be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I am mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; even clap my hands &quot;, and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; is=85..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Useless, and dead.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Thats=\r\n a useless conclusion, it is known by the world, not\n&gt; &gt; realized. Every to=\r\nm dick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point\n&gt; &gt; is the battery c=\r\nonfuses itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : So t=\r\nhe battery is the soul?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* W=\r\nho said that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : You did.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : *another phate=\r\nk on the head of the student* When did I say?\n&gt; &gt; You read it in one of you=\r\nr fancy articles and commentaries and satsangs\n&gt; &gt; that people do, genius, =\r\nand you read it all too wrong, you read it and\n&gt; &gt; thus think you &#39;know&#39;, y=\r\nou never practiced, fools you people are. Most\n&gt; &gt; of the time you people a=\r\nre fed bullshit and you gobble it up like pigs\n&gt; &gt; in mud. That reminds me =\r\nwe haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  pizza in a long\n&gt; &gt; time, lets order one. LOL\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Sorry=85\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Don&#39;t be, you are my child, I=\r\n love you. Anyways , back to our\n&gt; &gt; discussion on toys. The confusion of t=\r\nhe battery. And thus Chaman, you\n&gt; &gt; confuse yourself to be Chaman. This is=\r\n the 67432th time , you have been\n&gt; &gt; plugged into a a toy (read body) and =\r\nthe confusion prevails. Focus on\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;confusion&quot; aspect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stude=\r\nnt : Then who am I?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : You are the ever lasting consciousne=\r\nss, the universal bliss,\n&gt; &gt; the infinite, the ever pervading light of the =\r\nuniverse!!! Breathe in and\n&gt; &gt; out and feel the bliss!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : =\r\nYess!!! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*\n&gt; &gt; *Smells huge=\r\n amounts of odor*=85=85 What is that smell?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : I just farte=\r\nd, feels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Ewwww=\r\nw=85.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have=\r\n spent lives\n&gt; &gt; in search of who we are, and you will know just by breathi=\r\nng in and out,\n&gt; &gt; and thinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and =\r\nall that???\n&gt; &gt; Befkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : But you only =\r\nsaid that  &quot;You are the ever lasting\n&gt; &gt; consciousness, the universal bliss=\r\n, the infinite, the ever pervading\n&gt; &gt; light of the universe!!! Breathe in =\r\nand out and feel the bliss!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : It is called a test, and n=\r\needless to say you have scored a\n&gt; &gt; compartment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Hey ra=\r\nm=85=85=85.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : So back to who you are, you are just like th=\r\ne battery who is\n&gt; &gt; the source of that body and the personality and confus=\r\nes itself to be &quot;\n&gt; &gt; I am Chaman Sharma, age 20, resident of vasant vihar,=\r\n have a girlfriend,\n&gt; &gt; am a male, love to party, own a mercedez, worship a=\r\n a little, interested\n&gt; &gt; in god and whatever &quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : So who a=\r\nm I?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : You are duracell=85..How do they write post a mathe=\r\nmatics\n&gt; &gt; solution=85=85=85Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quite easily do=\r\nne.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Thats one more self identification of being duracell=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: =\r\n*Feels quite proud*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : And THAT is one more self identifica=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Hey Ram!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Ram Ram.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stu=\r\ndent : So I theoretically understand it , but how do I actually\n&gt; &gt; realize=\r\n it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : You do Sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Sitting in a yog=\r\nic pose and focusing on the lotus and all?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : I will fuckin=\r\ng beat you to your death if you repeat this\n&gt; &gt; bullshit ever again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Student: Sorry=85\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : No need to be. That is what is mean=\r\nt by Sadhana to most\n&gt; &gt; people. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Student : You shed some light on it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher: What do you thi=\r\nnk I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is\n&gt; &gt; basically in essence, and =\r\nmark these all important words.\n&gt; &gt; &quot; YOU trying to convince yourself that =\r\n&quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Births are spent on this my boy, births not li=\r\nves, it takes a lot of\n&gt; &gt; effort to tell and convince yourself that you ar=\r\ne just not you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : and how do you do that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher=\r\n : By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You\n&gt; &gt; eventually yo=\r\nurself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus\n&gt; &gt; realizing the=\r\n deity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the\n&gt; &gt; one (the sourc=\r\ne of all the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man\n&gt; &gt; ki tarana, do=\r\nes it not?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the =\r\nbattery and not\n&gt; &gt; this personality?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but the day &quot;=\r\nyou&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, to\n&gt; &gt; yourself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: I am b=\r\neginning to understand a little, can you explain where\n&gt; &gt; does a deity sta=\r\nnd in this whole battery concept?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : If you are the battery=\r\n, the battery has to have a source, you\n&gt; &gt; are not svayambhu that you exis=\r\nt on you own. The deity is like a huge\n&gt; &gt; power station in your comparison=\r\n. It is almost infinite, but since it is\n&gt; &gt; a power station it is bound to=\r\n have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa\n&gt; &gt; sized battery it is endless.=\r\n Chaman&#39;s source is his parents, but\n&gt; &gt; chaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery)=\r\n parent is the power station.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Hmmm=85.. that&#39;s why she i=\r\ns worshipped as ma?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a gi=\r\nrl who has realized that\n&gt; &gt; he/she himself is the battery and then went on=\r\n to become one with a\n&gt; &gt; power station and thus sees himself/herself in ev=\r\nerything because the\n&gt; &gt; power station is the source of everything , of all=\r\n batteries. And since\n&gt; &gt; he/she actually knows that all elements too are c=\r\nurrents and everything\n&gt; &gt; else too, he/she actually sees it as that. And t=\r\nhus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let\n&gt; &gt; say I fully well don&#39;t see a difference betwee=\r\nn me and this table, thus\n&gt; &gt; I am this table, thus If i wish to make it fl=\r\ny, I can do it, because I\n&gt; &gt; am actually it. To you it is a table, to me i=\r\nt is just a current, who is\n&gt; &gt; just &quot;me&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: Oooohhhhhhhh=\r\n=85=85.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but thats how your eye=\r\ns perceive him\n&gt; &gt; to be as, an old man with frail clothing, belongs to shi=\r\nrdi etc etc, but\n&gt; &gt; inside he is far beyond what you or I can comprehend. =\r\nHe first realized\n&gt; &gt; he was a battery by doing penance, thus killing himse=\r\nlf in the process,\n&gt; &gt; the he realized that the battery is as good as the p=\r\nower station because\n&gt; &gt; the current is the same, so he became one with tha=\r\nt, and then he went\n&gt; &gt; beyond and came back to guide as he was chosen, jus=\r\nt like many others\n&gt; &gt; are, like my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakris=\r\nhna and all\n&gt; &gt; others=85=85=85\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : And the source of the po=\r\nwer station is?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : The one- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it ca=\r\nn&#39;t be put into words\n&gt; &gt; because he is infinite and the words are finite. =\r\nIt is purely on\n&gt; &gt; defining him religious wars, riots between religions , =\r\nand intellectual\n&gt; &gt; discussions and debates on this thing called internet =\r\nhappen, but\n&gt; &gt; he/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people focus on=\r\n that , and\n&gt; &gt; get lost, but focus on the power station (deity) and it wil=\r\nl take you to\n&gt; &gt; big daddy.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine an endless field of current in com=\r\nparison of the power station ,\n&gt; &gt; an endless current which exists and all =\r\nothers are a figment of it. The\n&gt; &gt; power stations are a part of it, the cu=\r\nrrent has taken the form of one\n&gt; &gt; concentrated zone.. But even this conta=\r\nins error of speech, so chuck it.\n&gt; &gt; The ultimate is only realized when yo=\r\nu are one with the power station so\n&gt; &gt; lets focus there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student =\r\n: So the one has taken forms of different power stations to help\n&gt; &gt; the ba=\r\ntteries who are spread out to help unite back with it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : B=\r\nrilliant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: So all our lives we debate/fight and cut each o=\r\nther off to\n&gt; &gt; claim which power station (deity) is more powerful over the=\r\n other and\n&gt; &gt; superior to all others, when in truth our eyes perceive them=\r\n(deities) to\n&gt; &gt; be different, when they are in essence one(Satya shri akaa=\r\nl) and\n&gt; &gt; laughing back at us?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : ho ho ho=85.. Go on.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Student : And we try to worship 10 different ones and always think th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; we should worship as many to get maximum benefit for our mistakingly=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; confused identities of teddy , the car and all other toys?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Te=\r\nacher : *smokes slowly*=85 I am listening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: So the biggest=\r\n fools are those who are lost in debates and\n&gt; &gt; pseudo breathing in and ou=\r\nt and raising kundalinis with peacock feathers\n&gt; &gt; and punches to the spine=\r\n, reading stuff and debating on concepts which\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t know a thing =\r\nabout?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically you, s=\r\nhe is the\n&gt; &gt; battery. the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of =\r\n&quot;my\n&gt; &gt; kundalini&quot;, err=85. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyway=\r\ns ,\n&gt; &gt; many make this error, but it is essential because other wise you ca=\r\nn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; explain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are =\r\nher,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;you&quot; will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshippin=\r\ng lets\n&gt; &gt; say a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your f=\r\null\n&gt; &gt; glory . Whatever you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; limitations of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: So then how d=\r\no realized souls stay in their bodies post their\n&gt; &gt; realization?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTeacher: Intentional identification with the personality by permission\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfrom the power station to fulfill some higher purpose of the power\n&gt; &gt; stat=\r\nion to guide more batteries to realize that they are not toys. But\n&gt; &gt; they=\r\n can leave in an instant, because they know realities that are much\n&gt; &gt; hig=\r\nher than our world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : So what is moksha?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher =\r\n: It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven&#39;t merged\n&gt; &gt; back w=\r\nith a power station yourself first. You tell me when you have\n&gt; &gt; merged ba=\r\nck, how do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You\n&gt; &gt; yourself =\r\nhave become one with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even\n&gt; &gt; the batte=\r\nry has dissolved, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remember\n&gt; &gt; it, bec=\r\nause you are not there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : I can&#39;t explain it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tea=\r\ncher : We can&#39;t, It is like explaining the color red to a blind man.\n&gt; &gt; Yo=\r\nu will say mars  is red or the red light is red, he will say I have\n&gt; &gt; bee=\r\nn blind from birth I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. You will\n&gt; &gt; sa=\r\ny tomato, he will say fuck off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Yes, so It can&#39;t be expl=\r\nained.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : it can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculousl=\r\ny convoluted\n&gt; &gt; topic. To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a=\r\n car, one toy\n&gt; &gt; is a helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is=\r\n the same, but\n&gt; &gt; the car is very different form the toy, thus if you expl=\r\nain a high level\n&gt; &gt; concept to both, both will understand differently and =\r\nhave a go at it\n&gt; &gt; with debates and what not, which leads to more confusio=\r\nn. Better is both\n&gt; &gt; realize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that=\r\n you are duracell\n&gt; &gt; first, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, =\r\nYou are duracell.\n&gt; &gt; Now time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance =\r\nnaked on the road.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : What?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : You thought =\r\n4 times.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student: But I will be disgraced.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Nope=\r\n, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will laugh at\n&gt; &gt; Chaman, who is y=\r\nour 67432nd incarnation, you have done this thousand\n&gt; &gt; times before, so w=\r\nhat??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : I hate you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : I love you too.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Student : You are serious on this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Very\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\ntudent: : This is why some of the higher ones don&#39;t give a shit about\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\noaming naked and doing wild stuff, just to keep people away from them.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but a lot of frauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Student : Fine, I will do it. But you will handle my parent&#39;s reac=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Teacher : Done.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After the student did the act, nobo=\r\ndy seemed to recall the act the next\n&gt; &gt; day, yet every one saw it that day=\r\n, and seemed to make faces at the\n&gt; &gt; student for an hour or so. How everyb=\r\nody forgot is a different story\n&gt; &gt; altogether.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do sadhana, before=\r\n your battery is pulled out, replugged into another\n&gt; &gt; toy and yet again, =\r\nyour confusion will prevail driving you to do things\n&gt; &gt; that will push you=\r\n further and further down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jai Shree Radheya!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
