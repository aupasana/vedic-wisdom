Vimalananda in the Aghora series points out that each one of us=\r\n has an limited Bhutagni+ Jatharagni combination. The sum total is constant=\r\n.If one wishes to take up serious sadhana he will have to choose the middle=\r\n path with respect to food and reduce the quantity to being not too less no=\r\nr too heavy. If the fire is the stomach spends a lot of time digesting larg=\r\ne quantities of food it will not be effectively used by the brain in digest=\r\ning the spiritual food.\n\nLord Krishna in the Gita says.\n\nChapter 6 Verse 16=\r\n\n\n&quot;There is no possibility of one&#39;s becoming a yog&#299;, O Arjuna, if one =\r\neats too much or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough&quot;=\r\n\n\n\nThis is also the reason for fasting on Ekadashi days/Shani Pradosham day=\r\ns and using the day for total meditation.Also probably this is the reason N=\r\narasimha ji has asked one to maintain preferabbly an empty stomach atleast =\r\n2 hrs before the homa in the manual.Many other meditation techniques like S=\r\nudarshana Kriya ( AOL) ,Shambhavi Mahamudra ( Isha) also require not to hav=\r\ne eaten 3 hrs before the Kriya.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;srinivas&quot; &lt;sow4reap@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste =\r\nPVR Garu,,\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw your pics in your Ast.website and compared with the t=\r\nwitter pic (Sorry). Seems you have reduced lot of weight. Is there anything=\r\n that we need to take care of our food habits while performing any sadhana.=\r\nI have been doing Ganapathi Homam by your inspiration.I don&#39;t have any rest=\r\nriction in eating except non-veg,egg and bringal.I take a good breakfast al=\r\nong with milk,lunch,evening snacks and a nice dinner in a profuse manner as=\r\n most of people does.Will this food habits have anything connection in bloc=\r\nking the Spiritual goals.Kindly throw light on us.
