Moreover, t=\r\nhe liberating experience may come after a lot of sadhana.\n&gt;   \n&gt; Go ahead a=\r\nnd do it. Happy birthday!\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) Whether the puja lamp can be lit at t=\r\nhe start of the day (as is the\n&gt; &gt; usual practice) and pitr tarpana done af=\r\nter lighting lamp (of course, in a\n&gt; &gt; different place other than the puja =\r\nmandir)?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, pitri tarpana can be done after lighting the lamp or do=\r\ning a homam.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Namaste Rajesh,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 1. Is =\r\nit ok to do tarpan ( pouring water for tarpan and all) besides havankund? o=\r\nr at the same place of havankund?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2. While doing tarpan =\r\nvidhi, is it ok if in the middle of tarpan vidhi, =C3=82 i put ghee to hava=\r\nnkund for maintaining fire so that=C3=82 sopari ( which is used=C3=82 for p=\r\nurnahuti)=C3=82 can be burned totally?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Wait till the homam is complet=\r\nely finished and everything burns. Then start the other ritual.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3. =\r\nI am normally doing vishnu homam and tarpan vidhi both in my bedroom. In pi=\r\ntru tarpan manual it is written that during shraddha paksha ( this fortnigh=\r\nt) there is no harm in doing tarpan vidhi in house also..is this ok?\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nIt is ok. However, it is better to do pitri tarpana in another place. Peopl=\r\ne&#39;s minds are quite vulnerable when they are asleep, to various influences.=\r\n When you do a pitri tarpana or otherwise contemplate on the ancestors who =\r\nare blocked from higher realms of being, you may be leaving some thoughts r=\r\nelated to them and their weaknesses in that place. That is normally harmles=\r\ns, but a very sensitive person sleeping there may be somewhat disturbed by =\r\nit.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 4.=C3=82 Lacking knowledge of sanskrit,=C3=82 chanting of shlok=\r\nas from manual and giving tarpan is becoming most of the time mechanical. I=\r\n feel no devotion there.=C3=82 Is it ok,=C3=82 if=C3=82 i pray in my mind=\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 in my mother tongue=C3=82 to all devas, pitrus and rishis to =\r\naccept my pitru tarpan and requesting them to not to be obstacles in my spi=\r\nritual progress and material progress?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, it is ok. You did not kno=\r\nw the procedure earlier, but now you know it. You do not know the meanings =\r\nnow, but you will know it later, when the time comes. Knowledge and ability=\r\n to act on it come in stages. Grab whatever comes to you..\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 5. My go=\r\ntra is Kaudinya gotra? it can not be seen=C3=82 in pitru manual? can u help=\r\n me which rishi=C3=82 my gotra belong to?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The name of your gotra rish=\r\ni then is Koundinya. :-)\n&gt;  \n&gt; The rishi tarpana section in the Pitri tarpa=\r\nna manual only includes the Saptarshis. You can add your gotra rishis if yo=\r\nu want.

Now, the pot already has akshats lying=\r\n at the bottom, is it fine to add sesame seeds as well to the same pit, or =\r\nseparate pot is to be used?\n&gt;  \n&gt; You can use the same pot/vessel/kalasham.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Also, if the water has reduced in the pot after offerings to Devas=\r\n and Rishis, is it OK to add more water to the pot (if same as asked in pre=\r\nvious question) before start offering to Pitris?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, you can add mor=\r\ne water.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Namaste Bhupendra ji,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; At t=\r\nhe end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said in conclusion:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there =\r\nsome mp3 that would help in learning how to say this?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Good point.
