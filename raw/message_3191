There should be about 700 offerings in saptas=\r\nhati like this.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, outside of the 700 offerings, there are t=\r\nhings like kavacham, argala, keelakam, raatri sooktam and devi sooktam. In =\r\nkavacham, no offerings are made. In argala and keelakam, only ghee is offer=\r\ned by adding swaahaa after each verse. I suggested reading raatri sooktam a=\r\nnd devi sooktam without swaahaa, because adding swaahaa at the end of a Ved=\r\nic verse with intonation is tricky. The swaahaa may require a modifcation i=\r\nn the intonation or even the anuswara of the last syllable of the Vedic ver=\r\nse to which you add swaahaa. That is why I suggested reading raatri sooktam=\r\n and devi sooktam without swaahaa.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the 700 verses of saptashati, t=\r\nhere is no issue in adding swaahaa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Free Jyotish S=\r\noftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Anup Ray &lt;aray_usa@yahoo. com&gt; w=\r\nrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Ravi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your response. \n&gt; &gt; I guess Na=\r\nrasimhaji advised on not using swaha inappropriately if we are not well-ver=\r\nsed in Sanskrit language.

I found the following text in the Chan=\r\ndi manual &quot;Whenever you encounter an =E2=80=9Cuvaacha=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C=\r\noochuh=E2=80=9D followed by a number, you may want to consider offering a f=\r\nlower or a fruit piece. For example, a rose petal or a raisin (kismis) may =\r\nbe offered. \n&gt; &gt; If you read all the 13 chapters adding =E2=80=9Cswaahaa=E2=\r\n=80=9D at each number in the text, you will end up making 700 offerings.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; When I tried to look into the 13 chapters, I encountered less than 60 &quot;u=\r\nvaacha&quot;. I tried scanning thru the durga saptashati for &quot;oochuh&quot; but am una=\r\nble to find the same. Maybe I am not looking at the correct verses.
