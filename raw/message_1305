Someone sent me a =\r\nfew snippets \n&gt; from an \n&gt; &gt; interview posted on her website. Please see be=\r\nlow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa =\r\nas \n&gt; her guru. It \n&gt; &gt; is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to=\r\n &quot;do fire \n&gt; ceremonies and \n&gt; &gt; show what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the =\r\nwhole world will\nbe \n&gt; peace&quot;. This \n&gt; &gt; is similar to what my guru was tol=\r\nd by Divine Mother when she \n&gt; appeared to \n&gt; &gt; him during Shata Chandi hom=\r\nam at Chennai.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She told him that many people are and will be born =\r\nwho will \n&gt; perform a short \n&gt; &gt; fire ritual on a regular basis, establish =\r\nsanatana dharma and \n&gt; peace in the \n&gt; &gt; world and also make quick spiritua=\r\nl progress individually in that \n&gt; process. \n&gt; &gt; Shree Maa&#39;s statement abou=\r\nt what Ramakrishna told her is along \n&gt; similar \n&gt; &gt; lines.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My gur=\r\nu was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular \n&gt; Chandi homam \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is \ndone \n&gt; 3 =\r\ntimes a \n&gt; &gt; day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous=\r\n \n&gt; places and \n&gt; &gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For =\r\nexample, \n&gt; there is no \n&gt; &gt; need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simpl=\r\ne ritual with bare \n&gt; minimum \n&gt; &gt; offerings is enough, but it needs to be =\r\nperformed 3 times \n&gt; everyday. When a \n&gt; &gt; few such centres are established=\r\n, it will apparently lead to a \n&gt; chain of \n&gt; &gt; events that will help re-es=\r\ntablish sanatana dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though not 3 times a day, these people ha=\r\nve done a Chandi homam \n&gt; everyday for \n&gt; &gt; 3 years in the same place and f=\r\ninished 1000 such homas. That is \n&gt; fantastic! \n&gt; &gt; It is the sadhana and p=\r\nurity of sadhakas that creates energy and \n&gt; brings \n&gt; &gt; deities to a place=\r\n. While several ancient temples are without any \n&gt; divine \n&gt; &gt; presence the=\r\nse days, new places of divine presence may be created \n&gt; by pure \n&gt; &gt; souls=\r\n engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the \n&gt; world.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam \n&gt; durin=\r\ng which \n&gt; &gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading =\r\n\n&gt; homam was \n&gt; &gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39;s birth anniversary and the time of =\r\nsankalpa\n\n&gt; was within \n&gt; &gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha ti=\r\nme of the birth \n&gt; anniversary. \n&gt; &gt; All of this was a coincidence and we w=\r\nere unaware of this \n&gt; significance when \n&gt; &gt; we decided the muhurta. It is=\r\n interesting to know that \nRamakrishna \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; mention fire ceremonies =\r\nspecifically to somebody and that his \n&gt; words are \n&gt; &gt; similar to the word=\r\ns of Mother.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Master, has a small ash=\r\nram here near the Bay Area\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is the very interesting par=\r\nt (snippets from her website\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pasted for your benefit), from an interv=\r\niew found here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonomy_menu/54/86\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You ha=\r\nve to\ngo \n&gt; now for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our country, and all other country, you have to g=\r\no do fire \n&gt; ceremonies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and =\r\nat that time the \n&gt; whole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American \n&gt; descen=\r\nt),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her and all \n=\r\n&gt; that;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was\narduous \nat \n&gt; best,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where\nhe \n&gt; stu=\r\ndied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi =\r\n\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of =\r\n\n&gt; worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities in the=\r\n \n&gt; process.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, =\r\na three year fire\n\n&gt; ceremony\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and worship of the Goddess, without set=\r\nting foot outside from \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; humble temple grounds they established in=\r\n Martinez,\nCalifornia.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------=\r\n---------\n\n|| Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\nYahoo!

Some\n divine plan &lt;br&gt;&gt; is=\r\n strongly behind this movement which is evident by activities of  &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nManish &amp; Narasimha, Ravishankar, Shri Maa and others who have &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nstarted it on regular basis.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; This were my thoughts. i sudd=\r\nenly realised a Yesterday the &lt;br&gt;&gt; coincidence mentioned above and thou=\r\nght it proper to put in front &lt;br&gt;of &lt;br&gt;&gt; all the list.&lt;br&gt;&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Warm Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;pvr@&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Shree Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets &lt;br&gt;&gt; fr=\r\nom an &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; interview posted on her website.. Please see below.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa as &lt;br&gt;&gt; her guru. It &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; is interesting that Ramakr=\r\nishna told her she had to &quot;do fire &lt;br&gt;&gt;\n ceremonies and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\nhow what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will&lt;br&gt;be &lt;br&gt;&gt; pe=\r\nace&quot;. This &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Moth=\r\ner when she &lt;br&gt;&gt; appeared to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; him during Shata Chandi homa=\r\nm at Chennai.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; She told him that many people are =\r\nand will be born who will &lt;br&gt;&gt; perform a short &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; fire ritua=\r\nl on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and &lt;br&gt;&gt; peace in the &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; world and also make quick spiritual progress individually in t=\r\nhat &lt;br&gt;&gt; process. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakr=\r\nishna told her is along &lt;br&gt;&gt; similar &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; lines.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; My guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; Chandi homam &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; should be established around the world=\r\n, where Chandi homam is &lt;br&gt;done &lt;br&gt;&gt; 3 times a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; day. Thes=\r\ne places do not need to be near any\n temples or famous &lt;br&gt;&gt; places and =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For exampl=\r\ne, &lt;br&gt;&gt; there is no &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; need to offer silk sarees etc in fire=\r\n. A simple ritual with bare &lt;br&gt;&gt; minimum &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; offerings is eno=\r\nugh, but it needs to be performed 3 times &lt;br&gt;&gt; everyday. When a &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; chain of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; events that will help re-establish sanatana dhar=\r\nma.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Though not 3 times a day, these people have =\r\ndone a Chandi homam &lt;br&gt;&gt; everyday for &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; 3 years in the same=\r\n place and finished 1000 such homas. That is &lt;br&gt;&gt; fantastic! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; brings &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; deities to a place. While several ancient temples a=\r\nre without any &lt;br&gt;&gt; divine &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; presence these days, new place=\r\ns of divine presence may be\n created &lt;br&gt;&gt; by pure &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; souls e=\r\nngaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the &lt;br&gt;&gt; world.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata=\r\n Chandi homam &lt;br&gt;&gt; during which &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mother appeared and gave =\r\ninstructions to my guru on spreading &lt;br&gt;&gt; homam was &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; taken=\r\n on Ramakrishna&#39;s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; wa=\r\ns within &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of=\r\n the birth &lt;br&gt;&gt; anniversary. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; All of this was a coincidenc=\r\ne and we were unaware of this &lt;br&gt;&gt; significance when &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; we d=\r\necided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that &lt;br&gt;Ramakrishna &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n did &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and tha=\r\nt his &lt;br&gt;&gt; words are &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; similar to the words of Mother.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as h=\r\ner&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snip=\r\npets from her website&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pasted for your benefit), from an i=\r\nnterview found here&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxon=\r\nomy_menu/54/86&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to&lt;br&gt;go &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; now for&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; our country, and all other country, you hav=\r\ne to go do fire &lt;br&gt;&gt; ceremonies&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and show what is trut=\r\nh, what is dignity, and at that time the &lt;br&gt;&gt; whole&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\norld will be peace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; descent),&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that same page describes his backgroun=\r\nd, how he met her and all &lt;br&gt;&gt; that;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but another inte=\r\nresting snippet in there:-&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was&lt;br&gt;arduous &lt;br&gt;at &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; best,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s =\r\ninterior where&lt;br&gt;he &lt;br&gt;&gt;\n studied&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with a number of g=\r\nurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi &lt;br&gt;&gt; and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of &lt;br&gt;&gt; wo=\r\nrship&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities=\r\n in the &lt;br&gt;&gt; process.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; ce=\r\nremony&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and worship of the Goddess, without setting foot o=\r\nutside from &lt;br&gt;the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; humble temple grounds they establishe=\r\nd in Martinez,&lt;br&gt;California.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;|| =\r\nOm Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
