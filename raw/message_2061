One of the of=\r\nt discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; If events have already been =\r\ncreated like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen in our plane=\r\n of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo tha=\r\nt makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in reality does not exist!\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; I am =\r\nnot questioning that what you wrote in the mail about events having already=\r\n happened, because same has been said by other great spiritual people in th=\r\ne world. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; But my question is because I cannot reconcile this wi=\r\nth a freewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world refo=\r\nrms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings in peace, harmony et=\r\nc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? But then if the Ka=\r\nlki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then such a self correctin=\r\ng option is already negated out.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a very=\r\n large viewpoint no one has any choice in the sense that finally everyone w=\r\nill end up merging with the divine.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not =\r\nreally as free as we love to think.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestes=\r\nt homam, purity and overcoming ego\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a v=\r\nery short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in =\r\nthe following mail:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/=\r\nmessage/ 761\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not pro=\r\nficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of th=\r\ne ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who and=\r\n a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with white =\r\nclothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and h=\r\ne hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, eas=\r\ny-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost i=\r\nn some serious thought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in=\r\n the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not=\r\n that the future that is to come has not already happened. It has already h=\r\nappened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You know =\r\nwhat I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. =\r\nI said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say =\r\nwhat I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or arti=\r\nculate. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sw=\r\neet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But=\r\n he could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say t=\r\nhat future has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to pe=\r\nople later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become rea=\r\ndy in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it =\r\non the screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you sa=\r\nying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I =\r\nam saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will happen when f=\r\nuture comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, becaus=\r\ne it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew w=\r\nhy he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the ho=\r\nrse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was pr=\r\nobably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things, =\r\nthis probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who =\r\nhad not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and came to=\r\n some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Time seem=\r\ns linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of =\r\nconssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its mean=\r\ning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a=\r\n small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. =\r\nWhen we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerf=\r\nul energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel normally. This int=\r\nense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can=\r\n be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left=\r\n to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had experi=\r\nenced the same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced=\r\n the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who w=\r\nas doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected =\r\nopportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing=\r\n within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and wor=\r\nshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all=\r\n the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy =\r\nremarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest=\r\n homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just=\r\n felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This boy performed a =\r\nreally simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But=\r\n it seemed like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest ther=\r\ne. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and ge=\r\nt more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doin=\r\ng it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritu=\r\nal practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage in exte=\r\nrnal practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purit=\r\ny is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist a=\r\nttraction to external things better and you can resist internal enemies lik=\r\ne lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thi=\r\nnking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all proble=\r\nms.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively =\r\nchallenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you -=\r\n including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is=\r\n god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these prop=\r\nerties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion=\r\n &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s pr=\r\noperties, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for t=\r\naking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best ca=\r\nre of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does n=\r\not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s p=\r\nroperty and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job =\r\nwith what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or wh=\r\nat is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant w=\r\nho takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of worldl=\r\ny life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       ICC World Twenty20 Eng=\r\nland &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!
