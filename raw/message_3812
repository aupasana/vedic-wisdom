But again Dharma is personal. One&#39;s Dharma gets refined=\r\n by following detachment in actions.\n\n------\nHere is a repost of PVRji on D=\r\nharma and Attachment:\n\n\nAs Vimalananda says, dharma is indeed personal. Kri=\r\nshna clearly says in\nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerou=\r\ns to follow someone\nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the path of dharma basically=\r\n means engaging in the right\naction/duty. Right action varies from person t=\r\no person, from time to time\nand from place to place. It is dependent on wha=\r\nt nature expects from you,\nwhich in turn is based on who you have been in t=\r\nhe past, what actions you\ndid in the past while identifying with the action=\r\n, who you affected in the\npast (and how) with the actions that you identifi=\r\ned with, what debts you\ncreated in the process, and what mental tendencies =\r\nyou accumulated until\nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic=\r\n debts, nature wants a person\nto kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma. If, based on one&#39;s mental\ntendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a p=\r\nerson to spread the message of\nuniformity of all religions, that becomes on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature w=\r\nants a person to spread the\nritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;=\r\ns dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=\r\nts a person to make a lot of\nmoney and construct a temple, that becomes one=\r\n&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a being may change from one life to anothe=\r\nr.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his guru=\r\ns,\nelders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much wei=\r\nght\non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremend=\r\nous\ndestruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great ext=\r\nent,\nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great war=\r\nrior,\nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and=\r\n\nrespected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n\nWhen=\r\n the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\nRamakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\nprevious life, a=\r\nccording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this\nnew time and pl=\r\nace. He was born to renounce material life despite his\naristocratic upbring=\r\ning and live the simple life of a monk and inspire\ngenerations to embrace a=\r\n simple life of mental detachment and service to\nothers. When he is born ag=\r\nain (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\nsaid), his dharma based on th=\r\ne time and place may be something else.\n\n* * *\n\nThe tricky question is: How=\r\n does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\nSome people have interpreted Krishn=\r\na&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma\nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in =\r\nthe light of castism. Though the concept\nof caste (varna) has been there in=\r\n Hinduism for a long time, the concept of\ncaste mobility was very much ther=\r\ne. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\nkilling birds. He became a brahmana an=\r\nd a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a\nkshatrita and a powerful king. He bec=\r\name a brahmana and and a maharshi\nlater. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitu=\r\nde. One starts off with the varna\nof father, because that is what one is ex=\r\nposed to in childhood. As one\ndevelops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna ba=\r\nsed on what one does.\n\nThus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which=\r\n tells you to know your\ndharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there ar=\r\ne not just 4 dharmas in\nthe world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\nKnow=\r\ning what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\nenough=\r\n, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our\nmind =\r\nthat tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\nnoise fr=\r\nom other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\nconfused.=\r\n\n\nWe should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition a=\r\nnd\ndecide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but do=\r\ning\nthe best we can is all that we can do!\n\nMore than following dharma, wha=\r\nt is of utmost importance is to engage in\nactions without identification. *=\r\nThat* alone ensures that we are not\naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not incre=\r\nasing the load. We should not build\ntoo much attachment to what we are doin=\r\ng. We should engage in the best\npossible actions (based on our best judgmen=\r\nt on what our dharma in the given\nsituation is), with as little attachment =\r\nand self-identification with the\naction as possible. When the action is fin=\r\nished, we should leave the result\nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;=\r\nwhat will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma=\r\n yoga (unfication through\nuntached action) will simplify our ego and purify=\r\n our consciousness slowly.\nAs we become purer, our mind will work sharper a=\r\nnd tell our dharma clearer.\nThere is a positive feedback here. This will sl=\r\nowly enable us to see our\ndharma clearly and follow it without incurring ne=\r\nw karmas. This is not easy,\nbut not as difficult as people think.\n\nThe bott=\r\nomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of\n&quot;this =\r\nis my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with\nlittle a=\r\nttachment.\n\n* * *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition =\r\nare the inputs.\nAnother external input is the words of scriptures and learn=\r\ned men. One can\nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to =\r\none&#39;s spiritual\nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can ta=\r\nke the words of\nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerel=\r\ny.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing =\r\ngurus\nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified =\r\nhis\ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dh=\r\narma\nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadh=\r\nana,\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the ma=\r\nterial\nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who is not in tune wit=\r\nh nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s\ndebts are and what nature=\r\n expects from one can err in the judgment of what\none&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s=\r\n guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into\none&#39;s inner core, such =\r\na guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline is that I (or anybody)=\r\n cannot outline a set of principles and\ndeclare that as the dharma. No, dha=\r\nrma changes from person to person, from\ntime to time and from place to plac=\r\ne. Also, there are no thumbrules to find\nout what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one=\r\n can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s\ndharma by increasing internal puri=\r\nty. By doing various kinds of spiritual\nsadhana (like homam, japam etc) and=\r\n engaging in actions without much\nattachment, one can slowly purify oneself=\r\n and refine one&#39;s understanding of\none&#39;s individual dharma.\n\n\n\n\n-------\n\n&quot;S=\r\nense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long as one=\r\n does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at=\r\n 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;I agree with Dinesh. Only very advance=\r\nd sadhakas will be able to identify rnas / karmic debts and know how/where/=\r\nwhy they are to be paid off. The rest of us have to follow dharma, which in=\r\ncludes standing up for what is right and righteous and not being defeatist =\r\nor fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could have written off the wrongs of the K=\r\nauravas as a massive rnu, but of course, Krishna urged him to take up the d=\r\nharma of kshatriyahood and slay without mercy.

Mr. FL is under great pres=\r\nsure due to that.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react in=\r\n the situations:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act =\r\nHe can-\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress,=\r\n resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and ex=\r\nternal activities concerning that issue.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In this case, He =\r\nstrongly identifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, R=\r\nepenting etc...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; OR\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden c=\r\nhance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practi=\r\nce) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be paid back and practica=\r\nlly starts training the mind with that knowledge. He follows up for the mon=\r\ney but with the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to his family and=\r\n friends that he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But i=\r\nn his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfi=\r\nlled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If t=\r\nhey needed to come back, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nulli=\r\nfy some past rinas then they will not come back.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; With the =\r\nSecond Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be able=\r\n to break free from this particular chain.

If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not=\r\n be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the=C3=82 thing in =\r\nyour mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a nak=\r\ned female(or male as=C3=82 may be the case)=C3=82 body is like a landscape =\r\npicture just like any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara fall=\r\ns, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly=C3=82 =\r\nfeel that the picture=C3=82 is very beautiful=C3=82 but you need not be aro=\r\nused by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases to think of sex all=\r\n the while.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes you may still encounter it, but that is another story=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Man=\r\nish\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; On Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at=\r\n 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

For now I ha=\r\nve very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to re=\r\nad more! \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but =\r\nAghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One o=\r\nf the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=82 Aghora (aghori) does not =\r\nsee anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manif=\r\nestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is per=\r\nmanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam saty=\r\na hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name=\r\n of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to r=\r\nemind oneself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only th=\r\ne Lord is real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this=\r\n ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a suppo=\r\nsedly great thing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, ca=\r\nn&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the prai=\r\nses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell =\r\non temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and =\r\nwant to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing t=\r\nhat seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are tempora=\r\nry illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n i=\r\nllusions&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are abou=\r\nt to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.

His mind rejects all *impermanen=\r\nt manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying the=\r\nm as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attract=\r\nion/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he tak=\r\nes it to extremes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is =\r\nan illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both=\r\n impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Se=\r\nlf, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual=\r\n where feces is eaten.=C3=82 But, please remember that eating feces is not =\r\nthe main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceivi=\r\nng an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main poi=\r\nnt. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a pe=\r\nrson&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) =\r\nwhile eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will=\r\n not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain propert=\r\nies and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is S=\r\nelf and he is eating Self.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedanti=\r\nn also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food=\r\n, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless,=\r\n such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s th=\r\ninking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of=\r\n Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cra=\r\ncker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the sam=\r\ne truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But=\r\n aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in=\r\n a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forci=\r\nng one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic ver=\r\nse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and =\r\nnicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while=\r\n eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice=\r\n) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, =\r\nif the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it wi=\r\nll be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual=\r\n experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished b=\r\ny everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadha=\r\nnas succeeds.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is do=\r\ning a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for s=\r\nex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the=\r\n middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and=\r\n keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for ove=\r\nrcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract=\r\n one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that t=\r\nhe fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how=\r\n to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the roo=\r\nt cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana an=\r\nd sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may c=\r\nombine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose a=\r\nn aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does=\r\n his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may =\r\nthink that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do=\r\n japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogra=\r\nmmed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no lo=\r\nnger feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and se=\r\nx may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no l=\r\nonger evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small th=\r\noughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to\n dense=\r\nr and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadh=\r\nana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so m=\r\nuch time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and t=\r\nhrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, =\r\nthe person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experienc=\r\nes and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down=\r\n some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine t=\r\nhose structures.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof =\r\nmethod? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging i=\r\nn the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for medit=\r\nation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), =\r\nif one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Bottomline is that a=\r\nn aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fi=\r\nght with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carp=\r\net and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not appli=\r\ncable to all.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n  *\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and w=\r\nhat is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb V=\r\nedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. Howe=\r\nver, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More =\r\ndangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong unders=\r\ntanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=82 Aghora stands fo=\r\nr neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursu=\r\ning thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upani=\r\nshads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the tru=\r\nth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritu=\r\nal paths and explains the basic reality.

His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis=C3=\r\n=82 mention=C3=82  great details about all the=C3=82 nine avaranas and diff=\r\nerent forms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.=C3=82 In=\r\n the Dhyana Krithi=C3=82 of those, in the very=C3=82 first line he says, &#39;K=\r\namalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=C3=82 That line tells me that=C3=\r\n=82 even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.=C3=82 \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So my question was in that perspective. Anyway,=\r\n your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surround=\r\ned by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of=\r\n reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do=\r\n during navaratri of 2010.

Krishna clearly says in&lt;br&gt;Bha=\r\ngavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone&lt;br&gt;e=\r\nlse&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFollowing the path of dharma basically means engagi=\r\nng in the right&lt;br&gt;action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, =\r\nfrom time to time&lt;br&gt;and from place to place. It is dependent on what natur=\r\ne expects from you,&lt;br&gt;\n\nwhich in turn is based on who you have been in the=\r\n past, what actions you&lt;br&gt;did in the past while identifying with the actio=\r\nn, who you affected in the&lt;br&gt;past (and how) with the actions that you iden=\r\ntified with, what debts you&lt;br&gt;\n\ncreated in the process, and what mental te=\r\nndencies you accumulated until&lt;br&gt;now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If, based on one&#39;s mental ten=\r\ndencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person&lt;br&gt;to kill evil persons, th=\r\nat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental&lt;br&gt;\n\ntendencies and karm=\r\nic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of&lt;br&gt;uniformity of a=\r\nll religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;mental tende=\r\nncies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the&lt;br&gt;\n\nritual of =\r\nhomam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;mental=\r\n tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of&lt;br&gt;mon=\r\ney and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the t=\r\nime of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,&lt;br&gt;elders=\r\n and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great exte=\r\nnt,&lt;br&gt;to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great w=\r\narrior,&lt;br&gt;\n\nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lo=\r\nved and&lt;br&gt;respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill t=\r\nhem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one =\r\nof&lt;br&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in=\r\n a&lt;br&gt;\n\nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different=\r\n in this&lt;br&gt;new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despi=\r\nte his&lt;br&gt;aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and in=\r\nspire&lt;br&gt;\n\ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and se=\r\nrvice to&lt;br&gt;others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ram=\r\nakrishna&lt;br&gt;said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something =\r\nelse.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tricky question is: How does one decide wha=\r\nt is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words sayi=\r\nng &quot;follow your own dharma&lt;br&gt;and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light o=\r\nf castism. Though the concept&lt;br&gt;\n\nof caste (varna) has been there in Hindu=\r\nism for a long time, the concept of&lt;br&gt;caste mobility was very much there. =\r\nValmiki was a shudra who lived by&lt;br&gt;killing birds. He became a brahmana an=\r\nd a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a&lt;br&gt;\n\nkshatrita and a powerful king. H=\r\ne became a brahmana and and a maharshi&lt;br&gt;later. Basically varna shows one&#39;=\r\ns aptitude. One starts off with the varna&lt;br&gt;of father, because that is wha=\r\nt one is exposed to in childhood. As one&lt;br&gt;\n\ndevelops in life, one gets on=\r\ne&#39;s own varna based on what one does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, the misinterpretation of=\r\n Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your&lt;br&gt;dharma from your caste is =\r\nwrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in&lt;br&gt;\n\nthe world. Each perso=\r\nn has individual dharma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very v=\r\nery difficult. If one is pure&lt;br&gt;enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In f=\r\nact, all of us have a part of our&lt;br&gt;mind that tells us what our dharma is,=\r\n but it is surrounded by a lot of&lt;br&gt;\n\nnoise from other parts of our minds =\r\nwhich tell other things. Thus, we get&lt;br&gt;confused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should make th=\r\ne best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and&lt;br&gt;decide what i=\r\ns our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing&lt;br&gt;\n\nthe bes=\r\nt we can is all that we can do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than following dharma, what is =\r\nof utmost importance is to engage in&lt;br&gt;actions without identification. *Th=\r\nat* alone ensures that we are not&lt;br&gt;accumulating new karmas, i.e. not incr=\r\neasing the load. We should not build&lt;br&gt;\n\ntoo much attachment to what we ar=\r\ne doing. We should engage in the best&lt;br&gt;possible actions (based on our bes=\r\nt judgment on what our dharma in the given&lt;br&gt;situation is), with as little=\r\n attachment and self-identification with the&lt;br&gt;\n\naction as possible. When =\r\nthe action is finished, we should leave the result&lt;br&gt;to god. We should not=\r\n think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it&lt;br&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adhe=\r\nrence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through&lt;br&gt;\n\nuntached action) will=\r\n simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.&lt;br&gt;As we become pure=\r\nr, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.&lt;br&gt;There is a po=\r\nsitive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our&lt;br&gt;\n\ndharma cle=\r\narly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,&lt;br&gt;but n=\r\not as difficult as people think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline is: Even if one is n=\r\not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of&lt;br&gt;&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refin=\r\ned with time if one engages in action with&lt;br&gt;\n\nlittle attachment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*=\r\n * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the=\r\n inputs.&lt;br&gt;Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned m=\r\nen. One can&lt;br&gt;derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to o=\r\nne&#39;s spiritual&lt;br&gt;\n\nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one ca=\r\nn take the words of&lt;br&gt;the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it s=\r\nincerely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and tho=\r\nught killing gurus&lt;br&gt;\n\nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Kris=\r\nhna who clarified his&lt;br&gt;dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was =\r\nconfused about his dharma&lt;br&gt;and wanted to renounce the world and go to a s=\r\necluded place to do sadhana,&lt;br&gt;\n\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevail=\r\ned upon him to stay in the material&lt;br&gt;world and do the work of Mother for =\r\nhim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is=\r\n, what one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the j=\r\nudgment of what&lt;br&gt;\n\none&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul wit=\r\nh a clear insight into&lt;br&gt;one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect gu=\r\nidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outlin=\r\ne a set of principles and&lt;br&gt;\n\ndeclare that as the dharma. No, dharma chang=\r\nes from person to person, from&lt;br&gt;time to time and from place to place. Als=\r\no, there are no thumbrules to find&lt;br&gt;out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one ca=\r\nn refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n\ndharma by increasing internal pu=\r\nrity. By doing various kinds of spiritual&lt;br&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc=\r\n) and engaging in actions without much&lt;br&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify=\r\n oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of&lt;br&gt;\n\none&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-------&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to p=\r\nersist so long as one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi =\r\nBanerjee &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:banerj=\r\neea@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:banerjeea@...&quot;&gt;banerj=\r\neea@gmail. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n=\r\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;I agree with Dinesh.

Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not repay it due to=\r\n reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and many dates but fa=\r\nils and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to=\r\n that.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react in the sit=\r\nuations:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act =\r\nHe can-&lt;br&gt;&gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under str=\r\ness, resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal an=\r\nd external activities concerning that issue.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In this ca=\r\nse, He strongly identifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it =\r\nback, Repenting etc...&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; OR&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 2] Mr. FL can r=\r\neally grab the golden chance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (=\r\nKIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be=\r\n paid back and practically starts training the mind with that knowledge. He=\r\n follows up for the money but with the attitude of detachment. Although he =\r\nshows to his family and friends that he is extremely concerned and it was f=\r\noolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some pa=\r\nst life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and s=\r\nhe will take care. If they needed to come back, she will do it or if they w=\r\nere to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they will not come back.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create =\r\nNew Rinas and will be able to break free from this particular chain. He may=\r\n have successfully PAID BACK his debt.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; With the first Appr=\r\noach, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly with Money and its owners=\r\nhip and hence all the actions done due to that, so He may have created NEW =\r\nRINAS which will be needed to settled on a later date.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nHowever I am not sure for what I have written.
