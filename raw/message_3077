If you do not have any \nidea, I may suggest the supreme cosmic being form of Mahaganapathi. Forget \ntrunk, tusks etc. Imagine a man with 1000 heads, 1000 hands and 1000 legs, \nin whom the entire creation exists. Imagine a man who eats whenever and \nwhatever each person in this world eats. Imagine a man who drinks whenever \nand whatever each person in this world drinks. Imagine a man who talks \nwhenever and whatever each person in this world talks. Imagine a man who \ndesires whenever and whatever each person in this world desires. Imagine a \nman who does whenever and whatever each person in this world does. Imagine a \nman who knows whenever and whatever each person in this world knows.\n\nImagine that a supreme being comes into the fire and accepts your offerings \nthrough fire. Try to surrender to that being and remove your mind&#39;s focus on \n*impermanent* things such as body, name, fame etc.\n\n(2) Sthoola sareera is the gross physical body with bones, muscles, nerves, \nblood etc and covered by skin. Sookshma sareera or subtle body is the \nessence inside that you cannot perceive with eyes, ears, nose etc. It \ncontains the life force and supports its movement. It contains various nadis \n(channels in which life force and self-awareness flow) and chakras (realms \nof self-awareness). Life force and self-awareness flow in it. Kaarana \nsareera or causal body is the sum total of one&#39;s karmas, i.e. all the \nconditioning accumulated in chitta over many lives.\n\n&gt; then how is this experience different from hallucination\n\n(3) Fantastic question! First, please read the following post:\n\nInternal god and external god\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n\nSuppose one is trying to see Sun and unable to see Sun directly. Suppose one \nis seeing Sun&#39;s reflection in a mirror. Sun is the so-called &quot;external&quot; god. \nMirror is your self-awareness or ego. As long as your ego exists, you will \nonly see an &quot;internal&quot; reflection of &quot;external&quot; god. Coloring and dirt on \nthe mirror may make Sun look duller and different. Similarly, conditioning \nof the mind and impurities in self-awareness may make one visualize god \ndifferently.\n\nOne sees a brighter Sun in the mirror as it is cleaned. Similarly, one&#39;s \nperception of god becomes better as one&#39;s mental conditioning reduces and \nself-awareness gets purified.\n\nNow, it is possible that one does not clean the mirror and simply paints a \nbright Sun on the dirty mirror. Similarly, one can just hallucinate various \nmystical experiences. That is certainly possible. However, a bright Sun \npainted on a dirty mirror does not give light and the mirror remains dirty. \nSimilarly, one hallucinating deities or other experiences will remain with a \nlot of mental conditioning. One&#39;s ego will remain, one&#39;s fears, anxieties, \npride, attractions, aversions etc will all remain. On the other hand, one \nwith a cleaner mirror really reflecting Sun better will see everything with \nmore brightness. Similarly, one with a real experience of god will becomes \nclearer in one&#39;s vision of what is impermanent and what is permanent and \nmake progress towards overcoming fears, anxieties, pride, attractions, \naversions etc.\n\nIn both the cases, what one sees is within the mirror. Similarly, what one \nexperiences is within the mind. But, in one case (hallucination), the focus \nis on the experience and the underlying weaknesses and root problems (dirt \nand color of the mirror) are not fixed. In the other case (real experience), \nthe focus is on fixing the underlying the weaknesses and root problems and \nexperience happens as a result.\n\nAs you engage in the rituals, visualize god to the best of your ability and \ntry to surrender to the best of your ability. Slowly, as the dirt cleans up, \nSun will shine bright through the mirror and shed light everywhere. \nEventually, if you are destined, the mirror (ego) may disappear and you may \ndirectly see Sun, without any limiting mirror (ego).\n\nThe key point is to clean up the egoistic impulses and other conditioning in \nthe mind while trying to visualize god. Holding a clean mirror or magnifying \nglass close to the dirty mirror may reflect Sun&#39;s rays onto it and they may \nclean up some dirt. Similarly, spending some time close to homam fire may \nreflect god&#39;s light onto one&#39;s limited self and clean up some conditioning.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 03, 2009 12:42 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Name and form\n\n\n&gt; Namaste to all,\n&gt;\n&gt; 1)Can somebody tell me how to choose some form of ganpati for mahaganpati \n&gt; homam.There are already so many forms of Ganesh,so how to chooose some \n&gt; form if i do not have any idea. Vimalanda in 2nd part says that in the \n&gt; begining we need to create deity with the help of our astral deity, so for \n&gt; that i think i need to know the proper roop for the homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2)if somebody could please explain what are these astral,subtle body & \n&gt; kaaran,sthool sharir, they are used a lot.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3)If in the beginning we see the deity from our very own astral body, then \n&gt; how is this experience different from hallucination, because we are not \n&gt; experiencing any which is something special. We are seeing which we are \n&gt; constantly forcing upon our mind.Had the deity been somewhere outside only \n&gt; then we were achieving something. Please clear my doubts on this. i hope \n&gt; my question is clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Jitender\n\n\n"}}
