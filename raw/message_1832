I am using Baraha Unicode software. Any way, I have to type completely, s=\r\nince Baraha is not supporting vedic swaras for Tamil language (Tamil langua=\r\nge has its own limitations for subtle sounds) and I have to find suitable/ =\r\nsubtle ways to get the same word to get the same pronounciation. This docum=\r\nent will be a quick reference guide (or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;) containing only mant=\r\nras and no instructions. I will send the same to Narasimha before end of th=\r\ne week so that he can publish it in his website. He can also add it to the =\r\nmain manual.\n\nRegards,\nShankar\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nar=\r\nasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks to th=\r\ne efforts of Ravi Poruri and Kishore Chitrapu, we now have Mahagnapathi hom=\r\nam manual and Shiva homam manual available with mantras written in Telugu, =\r\nKannada and Malayalam scripts (in addition to Sanskrit and English scripts)=\r\n. The instructions and explanations continue to be in English, but the mant=\r\nras are written in these languages for ease of reading.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We have also =\r\nmade available a quick reference guide (or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;) containing only m=\r\nantras and no instructions. If you already read the manual and feel comfort=\r\nable with the procedure and only want a printout of mantras to refer to, yo=\r\nu can download it and use it. It is also available for Mahaganapathi homam =\r\nand Shiva homam in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit and English scripts=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just go to the homam website below and go to Mahaganapathi homam or=\r\n Shiva homam link to download these additions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Other homam manuals wi=\r\nll also be available in this format soon. Ravi and Kishore are slowly worki=\r\nng on one manual after another.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Baraha software from baraha.com was u=\r\nsed for Indian languages (big thanks to them!). They have Vedic swaras avai=\r\nlable only in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. If you want the manual in any =\r\nother Indian language, please send a nice note requesting the friendly deve=\r\nlopers of baraha o add support for vedic swaras in that language. As they a=\r\ndd this support in other languages, we will create more homam manuals.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; In the long run, I want manuals to be fully translated to various Indian =\r\nlanguages, i.e. instructions and explanations also in Telugu, Kannada, Mala=\r\nyalam etc. But that may take a long time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
