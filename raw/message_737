If a  person\nis focusing constantly on the &quot;I ness&quot;  and on\nthemselves it is pretty self oriented , the opposite\nof what is needed.. However sometimes, one has to\nrealize how much &quot;I&quot; is there.\nWhen a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord talks\nto him personally,and that they are a direct vehicle\nto serve the Lord.\nthat is good indication the person is suffering from a\ncertain level of delusion/maya. In fact the world is\nfull of people who are either deluding themselves or\ntrying to delude others. \nBut it doesn&#39;t matter because the Supreme Lord knows\nwhat is in everyones heart and has the perfect plan\nfor our purification and realizations.Of course there\nare many paths to the same end.\n\nHere is one verse/quote from Lord Caitanya-\n\n&quot;One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a\nhumble state of mind,\n thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street;\n one should be more tolerant than a tree,\n devoid of all sense of false prestige, \nand should be ready to offer all respect to others.\n In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name\nof the Lord constantly.\nBest wishes\nLakshmi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; Pride of vidya maya (the illusion of knowledge) is\n&gt; far better than pride of \n&gt; avidya maya (the illusion of ignorance). One who\n&gt; learns vedas, upanishad and \n&gt; vedangas and is proud of one&#39;s knowledge and one who\n&gt; engages in rituals and \n&gt; is proud of one&#39;s rituals, are better than many\n&gt; people who are in utter \n&gt; ignorance and yet proud of this or that. However, my\n&gt; point is that both are \n&gt; far away from realization.\n&gt; \n&gt; True knowledge is one that makes one lose pride.\n&gt; True knowledge is one that \n&gt; increases the surrender. True knowledge is one that\n&gt; does not bind further, \n&gt; but liberates one.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you correctly pointed out, recognizing the\n&gt; problem of pride is the first \n&gt; step in improving. As you said, pride does not leave\n&gt; one even during \n&gt; spiritual sadhana! One may be proud of one&#39;s\n&gt; sadhana, even without fully \n&gt; realizing it consciously. One does not have to dig\n&gt; deep. One needs to only \n&gt; scratch the surface of one&#39;s mind, thoughts and\n&gt; instincts to see the lion of \n&gt; ego alive, kicking and roaring.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as one recognizes the problem and\n&gt; *consciously* tries to take the \n&gt; &quot;sarvam krishaarpanamastu&quot; statement at the end of\n&gt; rituals seriously and \n&gt; literally, one is on the right path and one will\n&gt; eventually overcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish keeps telling me, &quot;Narasimha, do not\n&gt; underestimate anyone. Each being \n&gt; in this universe has a birth right to liberation. If\n&gt; She wishes, a split \n&gt; second is enough to liberate one. Do not have any\n&gt; bias. There is a divine \n&gt; spark in *everyone*. Try to light that spark in\n&gt; people. Leave the rest to \n&gt; Her.&quot; Every person has a potential. Just some\n&gt; conscious effort is needed to \n&gt; fulfil that potential.\n&gt; \n&gt; First recognize pride and ego in your actions,\n&gt; thoughts and instincts. Then \n&gt; make a conscious effort to overcome it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):\n&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 06, 2008 6:08 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Maha Ganapati\n&gt; Homam / Re-igniting Fire\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; namaste\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Bharati !!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I too thought about it the same way as you\n&gt; mentioned. but as you and\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu Mentioned, God&#39;ll decide our worth\n&gt; and why should we\n&gt; &gt; bother about that. we should be doing just HER\n&gt; work without any sense\n&gt; &gt; of pride and It is Much much much more difficult\n&gt; to achieve than\n&gt; &gt; said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha has really made the difference with me\n&gt; and i am sure with\n&gt; &gt; many others as well. he has clarified some really\n&gt; nagging doubts. He\n&gt; &gt; has effectively convinced me that Pride is the one\n&gt; what needs to be\n&gt; &gt; controlled and finally annihilate. in my case,\n&gt; whenever i did some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, i would feel some pride which used to go\n&gt; unnoticed by me\n&gt; &gt; most of the times. Now atleast i&#39;ve started\n&gt; acknowledging it and\n&gt; &gt; that, in my opinion is the first step. once you\n&gt; acknowledge some\n&gt; &gt; errors then only you can take a corrective steps.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He has also blew away a big burden from my heart\n&gt; and that is the\n&gt; &gt; burden of Longing for subtle experiences.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and there are some other things which was\n&gt; clarified very effectively\n&gt; &gt; which i would mention some other time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; the following sentences of his would be really\n&gt; inspirational for many\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about mundane things like respect,\n&gt; disrespect,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;silliness, smartness, eloquence, disorganized\n&gt; writings etc. We are\n&gt; &gt;&gt;not here to impress anyone, including our gurus or\n&gt; sishyas. We are\n&gt; &gt;&gt;here to do sadhana, become pure, realize our\n&gt; mission, finish the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;mission and then give up the body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; some ligther thought from me: During Havan, it is\n&gt; you and\n&gt; &gt; MahaGanapati (or some other deitiy). so even if\n&gt; some unwanted things\n&gt; &gt; happens, you can talk to the deity and say &quot;it is\n&gt; you who is\n&gt; &gt; performing through me so i need not worry. it is\n&gt; you who needs to\n&gt; &gt; worry about that afterall.
