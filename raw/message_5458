This type of feeling will flash to almost everybody&#39;s mind oneday =\r\nor the other. At this juncture I am always reminded of the following text I=\r\n have come acrossed while going through one book of Sri B V Raman.\nI quote =\r\n\n                  &quot;POVERTY\n&quot;&quot;Poverty is a horrible spectre more grim-like =\r\nthan death.  Death puts an end to life and settle all worldly states.  What=\r\n happens after death,  nobody knows.  It is supposed to put an end to all t=\r\nhe worldly miseries.  Sorrows and anxieties.  Hence  there are  some people=\r\n who prefer death to abject poverty.  A poor man leads a wretched life.  He=\r\n is compelled to live in squalid and unhealthy houses.  The children have n=\r\no facilities for education, health and decent existence.  The poor man is g=\r\nenerally shunned everywhere.  He is an unwelcome guest at the doors of the =\r\n`well-to-do-`classes  His legitimate activities are obstructed by financial=\r\n difficulties and want of sympathy.  Poverty is a hot-bed of crime and vice=\r\n and the impervious sensation of hunger and thirst drive the poor to disgra=\r\nceful acts.  Whatever philosophers may say, the pangs of poverty are diffic=\r\nult to bear.&quot;&quot;\nCurtesy----Sri B V RAMAN\n\nIt would be great help to the need=\r\ny if we can do some  help when approached / as and when we get opportunity =\r\nof helping the needy person. It will be definitely pleasing the GOD.  We ma=\r\ny call it donation, dharmam as is called in Sanathana Dharma .  Several peo=\r\nple became poor to verypoor families over generations  for various \nreasons=\r\n (BATHIKI CHEDDA VALLU). They may not even approach anybody\nfor the sake of=\r\n false prestige(EGO Factor).\n\nMy humble request is try to help the needy wh=\r\nich need not involve financial support always.  Even giving moral support a=\r\nlso counts a lot some times.\n\nAtleast let us have sympathy for the poor for=\r\n their present state and cooperate for their survivol/uplifting .\nFinally w=\r\ne have to accept that Nature is always right and whatever we do we only rea=\r\np the fruits of our actions/inactions.
