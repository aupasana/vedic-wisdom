He \nconsulted so many physicians  and  was  getting  his  treatment =\r\n\ndone. He did not stop consulting galaxy of medical experts; he \nconsumed h=\r\neavy loads of drugs and underwent hundreds of \ninjections.   \n             =\r\n                                                        \n                  =\r\n \nBut the ache persisted with great vigour than before. At last a monk \nwho=\r\n has supposed to  be  an  expert  in treating  such patients was \ncalled fo=\r\nr by the millionaire. The monk  understood  his  problem  \nand said that fo=\r\nr sometime he should concentrate only on green \ncolours  and  not  to fall =\r\nhis eyes on any other colours. The \nmillionaire got together a group  of  p=\r\nainters  and purchased \nbarrels of green color and directed that every obje=\r\nct his eye was \nlikely   to   fall   to   be   painted   in   green   colou=\r\nr   \njust   as  the  monk  had \ndirected.                                  =\r\n                          \n                    \n                           =\r\n                                          \n                   \nWhen   the  =\r\n monk  came  to  visit  him  after  few  days,  the  \nmillionaire&#39;s  servan=\r\nts ran with buckets of green paints and poured \non him since he was in red =\r\ndress, lest their master not see any \nother colour and his eye ache would c=\r\nome \nback.                         \n                                       =\r\n                              \n                   \nHearing  this  monk  lau=\r\nghed said &quot;If only you had purchased a pair \nof green spectacles,  worth  j=\r\nust  a  few  rupees, you could have \nsaved these walls and trees and pots a=\r\nnd all other  articles and \nalso could have saved a large share of his fort=\r\nune. You cannot paint \nthe  world green.&quot; Let us change our vision and the =\r\nworld will \nappear accordingly. It is  foolish to shape the world, let us s=\r\nhape \nourselves first.   \n\nLets change our vision..!!   \n  \nBest Wishes\n\nSh=\r\niva \n\n\n\n"}}
