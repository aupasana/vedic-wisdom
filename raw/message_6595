Or, if he has no worldly desires, he is born in a family of Yogis who\n=\r\nhave pure\nintellect due to their practice of enquiry into the nature of Bra=\r\nhman, for\nsuch a birth is hard to obtain.\n\n81. A student, diligent in recit=\r\ning the Vedas, reads or recites them even in\nhis dreams through the force o=\r\nf habit. Similarly, one who practises\nmeditation, continues it even in his =\r\ndreams.\n\n84. A woman devoted to a paramour, though engaged in household dut=\r\nies, will\nall\nthe time be dwelling in mind on the pleasures with him.\n\n85. =\r\nWhile enjoying in mind the pleasure of the company of her lover, her\nhouseh=\r\nold\nduties though not much disturbed, are managed indifferently.\n\n86. The w=\r\noman with attachment to a paramour cannot fully do the work as a\nwoman atta=\r\nched to her domestic duties does, with enthusiasm.\n\n91. If he controls and =\r\nconcentrates his mind, he is a meditator and not a\nknower of\ntruth. To know=\r\n a pot the mind need not be controlled.\n\n95. Once the nature of the Self ha=\r\ns been conclusively determined, the knower\ncan\nspeak of it, think of it or =\r\nmeditate on it at will.\n\n96. (Doubt): The knower too, like a meditator, for=\r\ngets worldly affairs in\nhis\ncontemplation. (Reply): Let him forget. This fo=\r\nrgetfulness is due to his\nmeditation\nand not because of his knowledge of th=\r\ne Self.\n\n97. Meditation is left to his will, for his release has been achie=\r\nved\nthrough\nknowledge. From knowledge alone comes release. This the scriptu=\r\nres announce\nwith\ndrum-beats.\n\n98. (Doubt): If a knower does not meditate, =\r\nhe would be drawn to external\naffairs.\n(Reply): Let him happily engage hims=\r\nelf in them. What is the objection for a\nknower\nto be so engaged ?\n\n99. (Do=\r\nubt): This sort of reasoning is wrong, for there the scriptures will\nbe vio=\r\nlated.\n\n(Reply): If so, what is right reasoning please ? (Doubt): Right rea=\r\nsoning is\nto follow the injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures. (Re=\r\nply): But\nthey do not apply to the enlightened.\n\n100. All these injunctions=\r\n and prohibitions are meant for those who believe\nthemselves to belong to a=\r\n certain caste or station and stage of life.\n\n102. The clear-sighted knower=\r\n from whose heart all attachment has vanished\nis a\nliberated soul whether h=\r\ne performs or not concentration or action.\n\n103. He whose mind is free from=\r\n all desires or former impressions has\nnothing to\ngain from either action o=\r\nr inaction, meditation (Samadhi) or repetitions of\nholy\nformulas.\n\n104. The=\r\n Self is associationless and everything other than the Self is a\ndisplay of=\r\n the magic of Maya. When a mind has such a firm conviction,\nwherefrom will =\r\nany desire\nor impression come in it ?\n\n130. Those who give up meditation on=\r\n the attributeless Brahman and undertake\npilgrimages, recitations of the ho=\r\nly formulas and other methods, may be\ncompared\nto =E2=80=98those who drop t=\r\nhe sweets and lick the hand=E2=80=99.\n\nX. THE LAMP OF THE THEATRE\n\n9. That =\r\nconsciousness which reveals at one and the same time the agent, the\naction\n=\r\nand the external objects is called =E2=80=98witness=E2=80=99 in the Vedanta=\r\n.\n\n10. The witness, like the lamp in a dancing hall, reveals all these as =\r\n=E2=80=98I\nsee=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I hear=E2=80=99,=E2=80=98I smell=E2=80=99=\r\n, =E2=80=98I taste=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I touch=E2=80=99 as pieces of knowled=\r\nge.\n\n11. The light in the dancing hall uniformly reveals the patron, the au=\r\ndience\nand the\ndancer. Even when they are absent, the light continues to sh=\r\nine.\n\n12. The witness-consciousness lights up the ego, the intellect and th=\r\ne\nsense-objects.\nEven when ego etc., are absent, it remains self-luminous a=\r\ns ever.\n\n13. The unchangeable witness is ever present as self-luminous cons=\r\nciousness;\nthe intellect functions under its light and dances in a variety =\r\nof ways.\n\n14. In this illustration the patron(sponsrer) is the ego, the var=\r\nious\nsense-objects are the audience, the intellect is the dancer, the music=\r\nians\nplaying on their instruments are the sense-organs and the light illumi=\r\nning\nthem all is the witness-consciousness.\n\n15. As the light reveals all t=\r\nhe objects remaining in its own place, so the\nwitnessconsciousness,itself e=\r\nver motionless, illumines the objects within\nand without (including the ope=\r\nrations of the mind).\n\nXI. THE BLISS OF YOGA\n\n21. As the happiness derived =\r\nfrom sense-objects is covered by thousands of\nafflictions, it is misery onl=\r\ny. There is therefore no happiness in the\nlimited.\n\n37. Our happiness and m=\r\nisery, however, are not to be known by inference;\nboth\ntheir presence and a=\r\nbsence are directly experienced.\n\n39. If sleep does not produce an experien=\r\nce of bliss why do people make so\nmuch efforts to procure soft beds etc., ?=\r\n\n\n42. But the happiness experienced in deep sleep is not obtained from any\n=\r\nobject. A man may go to sleep expecting to be happy, but before long he\nexp=\r\neriences a happiness of a higher order.\n\n45. To remove that weariness the J=\r\niva rushes towards his real Self and\nbecoming\nunited with it experiences th=\r\ne bliss of Brahman in sleep.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.org/othervedantab=\r\nooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636833df67f0c5b04a644c490\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-FAMILY: Verdana,=\r\n Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;MARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3=\r\nem&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda Publis=\r\nhed by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;48.
