When lot of his disciples were seen m=\r\nissing from the daily devotional services, Srila Bhakti Siddhantha Saraswat=\r\ni Thakur (Srila Prabhupada&#39;s Guru Maharaj) found out that most of them were=\r\n lying down in the noon. He asked them to eat khichdi (grains are not allow=\r\ned on ekadasi, still he insisted) and go ahead with the daily devotional se=\r\nrvices. He told them it is essential to realize that fasting is important f=\r\nor devotional service, but it is not bigger than devotional service.\n&gt; \n&gt; r=\r\negards\n&gt; Prasad\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shankar789=\r\n&quot; &lt;shankar789@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am trying to do fasting for sadhana purpos=\r\nes.
