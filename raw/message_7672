It is difficult to describe the feeling that=\r\n She evokes, but it&#39;s like a flood of pure, distilled essence of&nbsp;beaut=\r\ny and you feel like there is nothing more to be done, no goal to reach, no =\r\npath to walk, no battles to fight -&nbsp;simply bask in the depth of the mo=\r\nment because therein lies fullfilment and a whole new world! She banishes t=\r\nhe very roots of the sense of strife and ugliness from your system... the k=\r\nnowledge that She exists is enough to\n incapacitate you from asking anythin=\r\ng more.

They bestow =\r\ndifferent aspects of Supreme Knowledge. &lt;BR&gt;Worshipping them for winning a =\r\ncourt case or getting a job (which many &lt;BR&gt;people try to do today) is like=\r\n trying to use a missile to crush an ant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding your dream, it m=\r\nay be genuine or merely a projection of your &lt;BR&gt;mind. Remember that mind i=\r\ns very powerful and projects various conscious &lt;BR&gt;and sub-conscious condit=\r\nioning as its experiences, especially in a &lt;BR&gt;dream.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you feel th=\r\nat the dream is a genuine experience of the devata, then &lt;BR&gt;keep doing\n th=\r\ne mantra and see what happens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you had the same experience with a=\r\nnother mahavidya, it is possible &lt;BR&gt;that your mind is just projecting. If =\r\nyour mind has affinity to a soumya &lt;BR&gt;devata with certain nature, it may i=\r\nmagine whichever devata you worship &lt;BR&gt;to have that nature!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If your=\r\n mind is imagining an Ugra devata as a benign smiling form, &lt;BR&gt;perhaps you=\r\n should stick to a Soumya Devata. If the devata really gives &lt;BR&gt;you a dars=\r\nhan in a fierce form, is your mind capable of handling it? If &lt;BR&gt;your mind=\r\n can visualize and perceive an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce &lt;BR&gt;form and y=\r\net feel deep love and surrender for her, then only you are &lt;BR&gt;suitable for=\r\n such a sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good luck in your sadhana!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yo=\r\nurself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://sa=\r\nraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hello,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One of the Ma=\r\nhavidyas I got a mantra from an astrologer and did it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for 40 days,=\r\n but with 5 days of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana, it&#39;s was so cool , but got a real viso=\r\nn in dream of what they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; call ugra devata , but Smiling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; at =\r\nme???
