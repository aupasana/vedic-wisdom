What I am trying to ask is..should one surrender\n\n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n any God we come across or loyalty towards one God is important? If\n\n&gt; &gt; lo=\r\nyalty is important then can I read Durga Saptashati and say although I\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n am praying to you mother I surrender to Lord vishnu only? \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Do not t=\r\nhink of it in terms of loyalty. Gods are not like egoistic people who compe=\r\nte with others and have qualities like possissiveness, jealosy etc. Gods ar=\r\ne different aspects of (and pathways to) the Supreme.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; All gods are s=\r\nlightly different emanations of the supreme cosmic being, who may also be c=\r\nalled &quot;the Self of all&quot;. In order to realize Self, one needs to reach the s=\r\nupreme cosmic being. That can be done through various gods. First develop a=\r\nttachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualities, think of him/her all th=\r\ne time and reach him/her. Then you can reach the supreme cosmic being throu=\r\ngh that god.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; One who is most attached to Vishnu/Lakshmi/Shiva/Durga/=\r\nGanesha/Surya should look at that god as the supreme god from whom all gods=\r\n emanate. All other gods are created from that god and rest in that god. It=\r\n is fine to worship various gods, thinking that they are all different mani=\r\nfestations of the god one is attached to.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If one has not found a god=\r\n one is attached to and about whom one can think like this, then one may ha=\r\nve to look more.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; During navratri is it ok to read devi mahatmyam w=\r\nhen a women has her\n\n&gt; &gt; periods? If no then what can she do to acheive the=\r\n maximum benefit?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; In my personal opinion, it is ok to read mentally.=\r\n If you do external rituals like homam, idol worship etc, however, I sugges=\r\nt not doing them during periods and to read mentally instead. This is parti=\r\ncularly true for homam. While I do not fully understand the rationale throu=\r\ngh personal experience, I like to respect the words of tradition and of peo=\r\nple who know more than me.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; My homam fire is small so just wonderin=\r\ng if it is ok to put chopped basil\n\n&gt; &gt; leaves,chopped betel leaves or shou=\r\nld one put whole leaf only. I always see\n\n&gt; &gt; you use the words whole turme=\r\nric, whole lemon etc hence this doubt. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Yes. Undivided and full part=\r\ns are better, but offering something compatible with the size of your fire =\r\nand making sure that it burns fully and comfortably is the most important c=\r\nriterion. So feel free to pur chopped things.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * * *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Namaste M=\r\nitesh,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; In the tarpana process we invite all ancestors in the coppe=\r\nr vessel\n\n&gt; &gt; but in the end what should we do, request them to go back to =\r\ntheir respective places?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The mantra used for invocation does not ask=\r\n for ancestors to enter the water in the kalasha. It asks them to come to t=\r\nhe area to receive the water offering. When they are satisfied with the ses=\r\name water, they leave. Explicit sendoff is not done in the tradition I am f=\r\namiliar with. If one feels uncomfortable and wants to send off formally, on=\r\ne can say &quot;OM pitruun yathaasthaanam sthaapayaami&quot;.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Also is it ok =\r\nto tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It is not ideal, but it is be=\r\ntter to do sometime than not to do at all.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * * *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Namaste Asho=\r\nk,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At the end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said i=\r\nn conclusion:\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...&quot;\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Can you clarify the meaning also?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The verse &quot;narakeshu samas=\r\nteshu&quot; at the end means: &quot;Whoever are stuck in various hells (inauspicious =\r\nrealms of existence in which mind can be stuck after death) and suffering t=\r\nhere, I am offering this water for them, thinking of their relief.&quot;.

First develop attachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualities, =\r\nthink of him/her all the time and reach him/her. Then you can reach the sup=\r\nreme cosmic being through that god.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One who is most atta=\r\nched to Vishnu/Lakshmi/Shiva/Durga/Ganesha/Surya should look at that god as=\r\n the supreme god from whom all gods emanate. All other gods are created fro=\r\nm that god and rest in that god. It is fine to worship various gods, thinki=\r\nng that they are all different manifestations of the god one is attached to=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If one has not found a god one is attached to and abou=\r\nt whom one can think like this, then one may have to look more.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; During navratri is it ok to read devi mahatmyam when a women h=\r\nas her&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; periods? If no then what can she do to acheive the max=\r\nimum benefit?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In my personal opinion, it is ok to read m=\r\nentally. If you do external rituals like homam, idol worship etc, however, =\r\nI suggest not doing them during periods and to read mentally instead. This =\r\nis particularly true for homam. While I do not fully understand the rationa=\r\nle through personal experience, I like to respect the words of tradition an=\r\nd of people who know more than me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My homam fire is=\r\n small so just wondering if it is ok to put chopped basil&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; lea=\r\nves,chopped betel leaves or should one put whole leaf only. I always see&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you use the words whole turmeric, whole lemon etc hence this do=\r\nubt. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yes. Undivided and full parts are better, but offe=\r\nring something compatible with the size of your fire and making sure that i=\r\nt burns fully and comfortably is the most important criterion. So feel free=\r\n to pur chopped things.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste=\r\n Mitesh,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the tarpana process we invite all ances=\r\ntors in the copper vessel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but in the end what should we do, r=\r\nequest them to go back to their respective places?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The m=\r\nantra used for invocation does not ask for ancestors to enter the water in =\r\nthe kalasha. It asks them to come to the area to receive the water offering=\r\n. When they are satisfied with the sesame water, they leave. Explicit sendo=\r\nff is not done in the tradition I am familiar with. If one feels uncomforta=\r\nble and wants to send off formally, one can say &quot;OM pitruun yathaasthaanam =\r\nsthaapayaami&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also is it ok to tarpana in the nigh=\r\nt say 8 or 9 pm?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is not ideal, but it is better to do=\r\n sometime than not to do at all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Namaste Ashok,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At the end of pitru-tarpanam, the=\r\n following needs to be said in conclusion:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;narake=C3=B1u sam=\r\naste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can you cla=\r\nrify the meaning also?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The verse &quot;narakeshu samasteshu&quot; =\r\nat the end means: &quot;Whoever are stuck in various hells (inauspicious realms =\r\nof existence in which mind can be stuck after death) and suffering there, I=\r\n am offering this water for them, thinking of their relief.&quot;. The next 4 ve=\r\nrses pray for the relief of relatives, non-relatives and relatives in previ=\r\nous lives and people born in one&#39;s lineage without spouse/children and all =\r\nbeings of the universe.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste=\r\n Parijat,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; at the same time....narasimha ji told in =\r\none of the mails........&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;mother knows the best&quot;...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; these have removed the misconceptions i had ...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; what i want to know is when one is devoted to maa why=\r\n does she test ??.....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is it a way to bring one closer to her=\r\n through realizations ??...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; when shes the all =\r\npervading shakti....why thers a need for test ??....also...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nhile testing does she give her child &gt; enuff&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; strength to p=\r\nass the test ??&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i am looking forward to guidan=\r\nce from u people...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Words come with baggage and may mean=\r\n different things to different people depending on their life experiences a=\r\nnd outlook in life.
