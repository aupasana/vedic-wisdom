Shriram Sharma Acharya\nDear ALL,\n\n   The fine sensors of our ears, eyes, nose, tongue and other sense organs\nhave direct linkage with the brain. Their functions are regulated by, and\nalso contribute to the qualities of the brain and the mind. If one of these\nsensors stops or reduces using the power of the brain then its share of\npower is given to the other faculties. For example, born-blinds are often\nfound to possess tremendous memory or gifted voice and expertise in\nmusic.... etc. One can, by determined efforts, direct the power of the mind\nso that it could be used by any one of the normal sense organs for the\ndesired development of the specific faculties associated with it. The\nexample of Kalidasa fits well in this context. His internal desire awakened\nthe willpower and the sincere efforts thereby turned a &#39;dumb fellow&#39; into a\ngreat litterateur and poet of historical eminence. Many examples are also\navailable in the field of physique and sports where extremely weak or\nphysically sick persons transformed themselves into stout wrestlers simply\nby regularity and dedicated exercises of the mind and the body - proving\nthereby, the truth behind the quote &#39;practice makes a man perfect&#39;.\n\nDuring the practice of Nada Yoga, one first tries training the ear(s) - to\nexpand its hearing capacities - by fully concentrating the power of mind on\nthis organ. By regular practice, the otherwise unused (sub) conscious power\nof the brain also awakens during this process and stimulates the subtle\nfunctional centers for extraordinary potentials of hearing. The ears can be\ntrained to &#39;hear&#39; the ultra, infra and even subtler and cosmic levels of\nsound during the advanced stages of these sadhanas. The karna pishacini\nsadhana  of the Tantra Science enables the masters of this sadhana to\nperceive the sounds from any desired place in this universe. Clairaudience\nis also a natural manifestation of spiritual sadhanas of Nada Yoga.\n\nThe methods of awakening the subtle power of supernormal hearing are based\non the above principle of fine perception of pure sound. This practice\ngradually leads to the perception and recognition of subtler levels of\nsound. Through the immense power of their mental concentration such sadhakas\ncan easily access the energy centers in the cosmos and &#39;sense&#39; the signals\nof Nada emanating from there.\n\n\n*Simple Training for Nada** Yoga*\n\nThe perceptions of sound (shabda), vision (rupa), taste (rasa), smell\n(gandha) and touch (sparsha) are manifested in the five sense organs via the\nfive basic elements of Nature. Thus, every entity perceived by the sense\norgans basically arises from a subliminal, non-physical form (existing in\ncetan). In the Nada Yoga, one gradually perceives the physical,\nnon-physical, sublime, supernatural forms of sound.\n\nAll the sadhanas aimed at gaining control over different tanmatras (powers\nof perception) progress well in the sadhakas who possess strong will power,\nsound mental concentration and emotional depth and stability. For instance,\nin the sadhanas of gandha, the sadhaka first practices to smell the odors\nthat inspire sacred emotions. He does so by physically smelling (through the\nnose) the substances like camphor, sandalwood or some flowers... etc for a\nfew seconds and then closes the nose and tries to feel the same odor through\nmental concentration. Similar experiments are done on tasting with and\nwithout tongue during the rasa sadhanas.\n\nOur ears hear the sound of the syllables pronounced by our tongue. One may\nconcentrate upon only the sound without attempting to recognize the syllable\n(or the word) and practice to differentiate between all variations in the\ntype and tuning of such &#39;spoken&#39; sounds to analyze the association of their\npatterns with the meaning conveyed by the corresponding &#39;speech&#39;. After\ncontinuing this practice with increasing focus and efficacy, he could\ndevelop the power to sense the finest level of variations in all kinds of\n&#39;sounds&#39; and to grasp the &#39;message&#39; (meaning) contained therein. The Yogis\ncan understand any language and even the voices of the animals and the birds\nthrough such sadhanas of &#39;hearing&#39; the sonic vibrations.\n..To be Continued ...\n\r\n--0016e64ca834c5313d046120c589\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Source : &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.awgp.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgp.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.awgpsouth.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgpsouth.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author : Pt.
