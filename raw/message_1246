A \nspritual \n&gt; aspirant should start &#39;Puja&#39; or Sadhana without thi=\r\nnking too much \nof \n&gt; externalities like cleaniness, posture, room, M C etc=\r\n. As one \n&gt; progresses, one learns what is good for him/her. Such is marvel=\r\nous \n&gt; way of God, who imparts neccessary and commensurate knowledge to \n&gt; =\r\nsadhaka. More one is in sadhana, more one learns about correct \nmethod \n&gt; o=\r\nf sadhana. What is of utmost importance is &#39;devotion&#39; to god. \n&gt; Greater th=\r\ne devotion, greater degree of learning. This knowledge \nis \n&gt; built in &#39;SEL=\r\nF&#39; as u progress, self becomes prominent, and thus \n&gt; knowledge thorugh sub=\r\ntle ways is revealed to individual. \n&gt; \n&gt; But above does not discount the i=\r\nmportance of formal knowledge of \n&gt; sadhana and puja. That helps a lot. But=\r\n it sometimes happen that \n&gt; people get bogged down by extenalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\negards,\n&gt; Sanjeev\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR.

For \nexample, \n&gt; the divine Mother has severa=\r\nl attendants (e.g. Jaya, Vijaya, \nJayanti, \n&gt; Aparajita etc).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Acc=\r\nording to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Mata was born with \nan \n&gt; amsa of=\r\n Bagalamukhi and some of his sishyas like Yogin Ma, Golap \nMa \n&gt; etc were b=\r\norn with an amsa of Jaya, Vijaya etc. They took care of \n&gt; Sarada Mata. The=\r\nse celestial attendants are born as human beings \nwhen \n&gt; god is born as a =\r\nhuman being.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As one&#39;s sadhana for a deity progresses, that deity&#39;=\r\ns attendants \n&gt; may visit one in celestial form (one may or may not realize=\r\n it).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, one should not think of all these things. It is ok=\r\n to \nbe \n&gt; aware of the possibilities and, if a result occurs, it is ok to =\r\n\ntake \n&gt; cognisance of it. But, expecting and looking forward to a result \n=\r\n&gt; corrupts the sadhana. The sadhana one engages in should be an \n&gt; offering=\r\n to god without anything *expected* in return. Such \nsadhana \n&gt; begets the =\r\nhighest fruits.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Moreover, whether one was visited by a deity&#39;s at=\r\ntendants or not \nis \n&gt; not really a measure of one&#39;s progress. One&#39;s progre=\r\nss is judged \nfrom \n&gt; the internal transformation. When someone praises you=\r\n (correctly \nor \n&gt; incorrectly, does not matter), does it make you proud? O=\r\nf course, \none \n&gt; may act humble externally and yet feel proud internally. =\r\nI am \ntalking \n&gt; about the internal feelings here. Similarly, when someone =\r\n\ncriticizes \n&gt; you (correctly or incorrectly, does not matter), does it mak=\r\ne you \n&gt; unhappy or angry? One may not show it externally and yet feel \ntho=\r\nse \n&gt; emotions internally. I am talking about the internal feelings \nhere. =\r\n\n&gt; Spiritual sadhana is about overcoming internal enemies and \nweaknesses \n=\r\n&gt; and reaching the state of sthita prajnataa. Anything else that \n&gt; happens=\r\n externally is secondary and a coincidence.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n-\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n   From: Ashwin Rawal \n&gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: =\r\nWednesday, February 18, 2009 1:15 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: =\r\nM.C.
