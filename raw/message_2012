We shall=\r\n see if I get my wish. \n\nLet me begin by noting that when we speak of evolu=\r\ntion, the entire conception is contingent upon the mind&#39;s ability to mainta=\r\nin an idea, and hold it in contrast to some other idea. This very ability i=\r\ns duality. Evolution, when considered in this context, has no meaning. The =\r\nduality of preservation versus destruction is itself an illusion, but whenc=\r\ne does this illusion arise? And does the very pageantry of images which we =\r\ncall phenomena come from the same source? If universal collective conscious=\r\nness (if such a thing even exists) is in the habit of flexing in order to g=\r\nain the stamina to hold a conception of its own evolution long enough to re=\r\ncognize it as a desirable state, then some kind of universal harmony can be=\r\n seen as a result of awareness or self-knowledge, order out of chaos. Howev=\r\ner, the concern that this state is in and of itself the ultimate problem, o=\r\nr cause of suffering, is formidable. But here we would be in U.G. Krishnamu=\r\nrti territory, seeing the pursuit of enlightenment itself as problem, enter=\r\ntaining the possibility that the mind is more than myth. But I don&#39;t want t=\r\no go down that road, at the moment. \n\nI am, rather, presently interested in=\r\n the mind&#39;s ability to establish non-syntactical positive conditioning, whi=\r\nch is less analagous to favorably programming computer to complete a task, =\r\nthan a streaming mass of assorted stimuli which somehow have positive or pl=\r\neasurable effects.  Since syntax itself is the recognizablly built-in probl=\r\nem of most models of consciousness, due to its linearity, and since most no=\r\nn-linear theories of consciousness, such as synchronicity, magical thinking=\r\n, etc, are not highly regarded in mainstream circles, merely gaining access=\r\n to the body of thought relative to this subject is no easy task, even with=\r\n the internet. Moreover, if the understanding of the dynamics of kundalini =\r\nitself, for instance, were to emerge as &quot;the\nanswer&quot; to humanity&#39;s problems=\r\n, such an understanding might even prove to be impossible to communicate sy=\r\nntactically, due to the experiential nature of kundalini. The problem is al=\r\nmost like that of 19th century German philosophy&#39;s simulataneous praise of =\r\nUpanishadic pantheistic imagination along with the assessment of the naivet=\r\ne of the authors. Because phenomenology must categorize, it will fail to re=\r\nvel in the ecstasy of Upanishadic imagination. Phenomenology may inform the=\r\n Zeitgeist, and at ever-increasing speed, but it may always lag behind, in =\r\nterms of immediacy of impact, the ecstatic experience itself, which often g=\r\nlimpses unclaimed/uncategorized territory. \n\nBoth evolutionary theory and p=\r\nhenomenology both suffer from some degree of linearity, whereas a system su=\r\nch as Tarot does not. The latter may be seen as a system of space/time loca=\r\nlization or assumption of identity, which hinges on the power of the imagin=\r\nation along with the ability of the body to hold certain types of energy in=\r\n order to execute the role which the mind has conceived. The ability to con=\r\nceive relations between various simulataneous roles or players in a state o=\r\nf harmonious energy exchange is to move toward a theory of Atman, whereas t=\r\nhe inability or unwillingness to do so is Anatman. Both processes are drive=\r\nn by desire, however. It is as if Anatman theory is panning for gold in the=\r\n stream while Atman theory takes what pieces are found and builds temples, =\r\nwhich, of course, Anatman theory may or may not recognize. \n\nThanks,\n\nJeff =\r\nBerger\n\n\n\n"}}
