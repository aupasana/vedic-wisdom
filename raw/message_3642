He never removed the dress and kept the dress on him =\r\nall the time and never considered the possibility of changing into a differ=\r\nent dress. The idea of removing that dress was unbearable to that person. H=\r\ne thought he should wear that dress forever.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dress became so dirty=\r\n and torn that it was time to change it. A person looking extremely scary c=\r\name up to the person oneday to remove the dress. He removed the dress gentl=\r\ny if one co-operated with him and tore it apart violently if one fought bac=\r\nk. After this scary person removed the old dress, another person came and g=\r\nave new clothes. Some people became so afraid and ashamed when they lost ol=\r\nd clothes that they ran away and roamed around naked. If they did not becom=\r\ne afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve soon gotten new clothes and slowly start=\r\ned to enjoy them as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The clothes in this parable are akin to the =\r\nphysical body we occupy. The person looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala -=\r\n personification of Death. Creator is the person giving new clothes. New bo=\r\ndy taken in the next birth is the new clothes.

And I have b=\r\neen reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling wit=\r\nh renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we =\r\nwere taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my min=\r\nd was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3=\r\n) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on =\r\na funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would=\r\n get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonder=\r\nful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so tha=\r\nt he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, =\r\nI had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly=\r\n reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a =\r\nfeat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experienci=\r\nng intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially\n&gt; in/around th=\r\ne abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as e=\r\nquanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon=\r\n after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind,=\r\n and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental im=\r\nagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a fr=\r\niend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I t=\r\nhink of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went a=\r\nway saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 th=\r\nings and in addition he bought some ghee. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was my first time =\r\nat a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dea=\r\nd body at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, b=\r\nut soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunse=\r\nt time), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the=\r\n friends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaa=\r\nsana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that=\r\n I would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39;=\r\n happens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid d=\r\nescription in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so=\r\n I think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!=\r\n!):). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my g=\r\nrandparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessing=\r\ns in my very first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana medita=\r\ntor, I am used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little =\r\nfast. I continued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centre=\r\nd enough. I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY w=\r\nith the purest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my m=\r\nind and found the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father=\r\n accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is =\r\n&#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/exc=\r\nitement too in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did =\r\nnot want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the=\r\n truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I hav=\r\ne done\n&gt; homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I h=\r\nave believed and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purificatio=\r\nn/ nullification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at th=\r\ne same speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure=\r\n mind that I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some pun=\r\nya and his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you=\r\n Maa, so please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this ho=\r\nmam. Please pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; After this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funera=\r\nl pyre (even though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely b=\r\necause the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga =\r\nMantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, a=\r\nnd it should not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could =\r\nnot just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple i=\r\nn colour, and fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - a=\r\nnd was trying to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had devel=\r\noped in his feet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought s=\r\nprung in my mind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who =\r\nwears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..=\r\nso this is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa =\r\nChandi, repeated mentally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering\n o=\r\nf\n&gt; my ignorance. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra =\r\nby explaning the context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scar=\r\ned too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she di=\r\ndnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing=\r\n this.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I had a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I b=\r\nriefed him about what I was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgi=\r\nveness and blessings. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (wi=\r\nth swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre=\r\n. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still c=\r\nontinued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then swit=\r\nched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was full=\r\ny aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. So=\r\nmetimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she wa=\r\ns crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet o=\r\nr a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the direction which w=\r\nas opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a littl=\r\ne curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere a=\r\nround. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, =\r\nbut I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite th=\r\ne deity, but nevertheless\n I\n&gt; continued. Few minutes later, I heard some s=\r\nound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I t=\r\nhink it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It ha=\r\nd come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyar=\r\nd or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It =\r\ncame close to the burning funeral and started jumping and moving around the=\r\n funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die=\r\n. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was=\r\n amused with the fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down o=\r\nn the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the=\r\n funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, t=\r\nhinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would =\r\ncontinue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30=\r\n more minutes. So I\n&gt; continued the mental chanting. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And then m=\r\ny cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to leave. I waited for =\r\neveryone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, j=\r\naggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walked towards the funera=\r\nl. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and asked her to accept my =\r\nofferings. I had offered only three times, and it was sooooo hot that I cou=\r\nld not stand closer and started wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi s=\r\nit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my n=\r\name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them, and even though it=\r\n was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was happening, I was a li=\r\nttle scared because I did not want anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tende=\r\nncies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of the packets in both =\r\nmy hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence and requested her t=\r\no accept this final offering and threw it at the funeral\n&gt; pyre from a dist=\r\nance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simply do the needful a=\r\nnd then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PV=\r\nR) and quickly walked and joined the group. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I was washing =\r\nmy hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a =\r\nred tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of blac=\r\nk sesame seeds or jaggery??). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On the way back home and for the =\r\nentire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I f=\r\nelt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happened was not st=\r\nrong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. Th=\r\nere was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my =\r\nbreath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;won=\r\nder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my own imagination - =\r\nbut the silence was real. And this experience of silence was the most beaut=\r\niful thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that=\r\n he had witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and some=\r\nwhat special. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or =\r\nlove for our father.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now that it is few days since that incident=\r\n, I have questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was=\r\n it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen =\r\nand the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temple=\r\ns? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did =\r\nI visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a h=\r\nalf-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to h=\r\nim? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure if these questions can be answered or if they=\r\n should be answered at all, but based on the above experience, if anyone ha=\r\ns any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, apologies for the length of the note.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Sharad\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

How does one decide if one is hallucinat=\r\ning or not? By checking on other corresponding things. See if you meet some=\r\none in reality vs you hallucinate, the hallucination is something restricte=\r\nd ONLY to your mind, whereas the actual meeting will have added factors to =\r\nit, which are&nbsp;not from&nbsp;within your body/mind.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For example, one day Manish was doing a Ganapati homam. There wer=\r\ne some people sitting near him and watching. At the end of the homa, Manish=\r\n asked one specific person from the&nbsp; group about what he saw during th=\r\ne homa. The person replied, he saw a form of&nbsp;a huge elephant, &quot;shendri=\r\n&quot;&nbsp;color enter the fire for a fraction of a second.&nbsp; Then Manish a=\r\nsked another person from the group about his reaction. This person said tha=\r\nt he did not see anything but he suddenly felt his mind being drawn inside =\r\ndeeper, such that he could not stop his meditation. As if there was some hu=\r\nge force nearby and it was pulling him. Then Manish said, Ganapati had come=\r\n into the fire and exactly at that time one person saw the elephant and ano=\r\nther felt&nbsp;the strong force. Also some more things happened in the comi=\r\nng days which confirmed&nbsp;that it was the real stuff. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;My&nbsp;point is, in case it is a pure hallucination of the min=\r\nd, you will not get simultaneous associated factors happening outside your =\r\nbody/mind which will imapct a third party.

After this scary person removed the old dress=\r\n, another person came and gave new clothes.

The person=\r\n looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator =\r\nis the person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birth is the n=\r\new clothes.

And I have been reading the po=\r\nsts on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggli=\r\nng with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. Wh=\r\nen we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, =\r\nmy mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai -=\r\n 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Hom=\r\nam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I=\r\n would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how =\r\nwonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - =\r\nso that he would\n also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immedi=\r\nately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I =\r\nquickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do =\r\nsuch a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started exp=\r\neriencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the se=\r\nnsations as equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would =\r\nchange&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level=\r\n of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in=\r\n my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so=\r\n I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery =\r\n(now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - =\r\nand he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with t=\r\nhe above 2\n things and in addition he bought some ghee. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the ver=\r\ny first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It was=\r\n a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (b=\r\ny my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in t=\r\nhe direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and =\r\nsat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew=\r\n to sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, and reques=\r\nted them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already observed a br=\r\nown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we=\r\n reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to =\r\nbehave a little differently (silly me!!):). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, =\r\nthe\n Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very=\r\n first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am us=\r\ned to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I cont=\r\ninued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I =\r\nremembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the pure=\r\nst intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and foun=\r\nd the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates=\r\n some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee=\r\n&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too =\r\nin my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to =\r\ngive-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, =\r\nI am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have\n b=\r\nelieved and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nu=\r\nllification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the sam=\r\ne speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind=\r\n that I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya an=\r\nd his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa,=\r\n so please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. =\r\nPlease pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; After this mental dialogue, I though of invoking =\r\nDurga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kal=\r\ni etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortab=\r\nle with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the=\r\n same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which Devi form I invoke=\r\n. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a\n cloud-li=\r\nke pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my mental imagery. I thou=\r\nght of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with the colour of gang=\r\nrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was different, and imm=\r\nediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colour with the colou=\r\nr of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and=\r\n I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did men=\r\ntal Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts about the desire=\r\n and surrendering of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my ignorance. I sought permission from the dei=\r\nty to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also remember clearly,=\r\n that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give=\r\n me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punis=\r\nh me in any way for doing this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I had a =\r\nsmall mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him\n about what I w=\r\nas going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (wit=\r\nh swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre.=\r\n I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still co=\r\nntinued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switc=\r\nhed to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully=\r\n aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Som=\r\netimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was=\r\n crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or=\r\n a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the direction which wa=\r\ns opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little=\r\n curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere ar=\r\nound. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I\n was not disappointed, =\r\nbut I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite th=\r\ne deity, but nevertheless I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continued. Few minutes later, I heard s=\r\nome sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen=\r\n (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). =\r\nIt had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a gra=\r\nveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall=\r\n. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and moving aroun=\r\nd the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral an=\r\nd die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because i=\r\nt was amused with the fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling d=\r\nown on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof o=\r\nf the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myse=\r\nlf, thinking a black hen came instead of a\n dog, but nevertheless I said I =\r\nwould continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he s=\r\naid 30 more minutes. So I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continued the mental chanting. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time =\r\nfor everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the e=\r\nxit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet i=\r\ntself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my i=\r\nmpudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three tim=\r\nes, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonderi=\r\nng how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? =\r\nAnother cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry =\r\nup and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen ex=\r\nactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyo=\r\nne to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39;\n tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied=\r\n the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again=\r\n for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and threw=\r\n it at the funeral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again a=\r\nnd requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (includ=\r\ning the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined=\r\n the group. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I was washing my hands=\r\n and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red ting=\r\ne to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesame=\r\n seeds or jaggery??). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On the way back h=\r\nome and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would=\r\n&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what hap=\r\npened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinkin=\r\ng about &#39;it&#39;. There was\n a certian stillness within my existence that eveni=\r\nng. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, jus=\r\nt a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my o=\r\nwn imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence w=\r\nas the most beautiful thing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The next d=\r\nay, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but =\r\nthe one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my bro=\r\nther was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now that it is few days since that incident, I have q=\r\nuestions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumpin=\r\ng &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fa=\r\nct that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Sha=\r\nkti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualis=\r\ne my dad crawl\n and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-const=\r\nructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not sure if these questions can be answ=\r\nered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the above experienc=\r\ne, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most ap=\r\npreciative.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Raj=\r\narshi for the continued inspiration. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Al=\r\nso, apologies for the length of the note.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sharad&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTERNET now ha=\r\ns a personality.
