I mean it because =\r\nduring my stay at my native village in Gujarat i unfailing observer followi=\r\nng things:\n- Every where you will find name of &#39;Amba&#39; - on Shops, on Signbo=\r\nards, written on Public carriers.\n- One finds Pictures of Kali or Amba insi=\r\nde State Transport buses\n- So many small or big temples of mother Goddess.\n=\r\n- often people greet each other with &#39;Jai Mataji&#39; or &#39;Jai Ambe&#39;\n- So many p=\r\neople visit &#39;Mota Ambaji&#39; (alongside with Gabbar Hill) and especially on Bh=\r\nadrapad Pournima.\n\nIt is truely a land of Mother.\n\n***\n\nI was told by a per=\r\nson to do Homam on a big scale while in India. He specifically asked me to =\r\ndo Homam with Lots of wood, Cow dung etc=85 asked me to prepare Homa Kundam=\r\n with Bricks and cow dung. Everything was fulfilled yesterday at my native =\r\non Chaturdashi day where we could perform Chandi Homam in a Kundam prepared=\r\n by bricks and cow dung. Lot of wood was consumed and It was a Big fire whi=\r\nch could consume Mangoes, Saree and even Green Coconut.\n\nSo as Narasimha sa=\r\nid else where, i thoroughly enjoyed doing Homam in front of &#39;big fire&#39;. I w=\r\nish i could do such Homam regularly.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n \n\n\n"}}
