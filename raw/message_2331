Women have a special bath on the day using a spe=\r\ncial herb. Special Kalasham  is prepared on the day and prayed to. The devo=\r\ntee is required to keep  perfect Purity in body and mind on this day. Rishi=\r\n Panchami pooja is performed only  by women to get rid of the bad effects d=\r\nuring their menstrual cycle period. On this day women ask for forgiveness f=\r\nor any sin committed during their monthly periods. In Hindu religion, menst=\r\nruation is taken as a symbol of impurity and women are not allowed to take =\r\npart in religious observances and practices during their periods. Rishi Pan=\r\nchami is the occasion to wash of one`s impurity.\n&gt; G.Balasubramanian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak=\r\n@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, August 23, 2009 12=\r\n:52:58 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rishi Panchami !\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; Namaste Fri=\r\nends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Tomorrow is &quot;Rishi Panchami&quot;.
