You might approach temple archak=\r\na-s /\nAgama-pAThashAlA-s, who will know about such books, as well as the\nsu=\r\nbject at hand. Here are the books that I have come across.\n\n(1) http://www.=\r\nswarnapuri.org/SwarPUBList.html -- Look for the tamil\nbook &quot;sivaalaya utsav=\r\nangal&quot; which covers brahmotsava and pavitrotsava.\nI haven&#39;t seen the book, =\r\nso I don&#39;t know anything else about it.\n\n(2) The rituals followed in Chidam=\r\nbaram as codified by Patanjali have\nbeen published in the 1970s in a two bo=\r\nok set\n&quot;chidambara-kShetra-sarvasvam&quot;. The details are in Sanskrit\n(devanAg=\r\nari), and some of the mantras are only indicated by leading\nwords.\n\n(3) The=\r\n entire shaivAgama prayoga, as codified by aghora-shivAcharya\nhas been codi=\r\nfied in a 11 book set, one per deity / topic. This is\npublished in grantham=\r\n / tamil.\n\niti bhavadIyaH,\n\n       ajit\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 15, 2009 at 8:52 PM, =\r\nmaga romu &lt;maga_romu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namast=E9,\n&gt;\n&gt; please , i search bo=\r\noks of mantras and rules for &quot;vasthu shanti&quot; not for\n&gt; house but for alayam=\r\n for purification of the shrine.\n&gt; All information will be good.\n&gt;\n&gt; thank =\r\nyou magalingom\n&gt; \n\n"}}
