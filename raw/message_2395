By withdrawing our identification with the matter layers we can regain our real and true  nature of the Atman.  The thrashing or pounding of the paddy suggess a comparison to the hard and gruelling experiences  in the world which makes us more mature and introvert in life.  Thus gradually, we  come to detach ourselves from the physical body and the external world.   When our mind turns introvert  and if we take to discriminative self-analysis and logical thinking,  we recognise the pure Atman beyond the layers of matter.  With the help of the discriminatory faculty we should  distinguish the real from the unreal. Thereby the individual gets dexterity in withdrawing his mind from the unreal. Agjnaanena aavritam gyanam tena muhyanti\n jantavah says the Bagavad Gita.  It means that the real is veiled by the unreal and so the creatures suffer delusion.  For achieving such an intelligent discrimination, we need to possess  what is known as   Vyavasaayaatmic Buddhi or one-pointed determination  as again, the Gita declares.\n \nEven though Atman is  always all-pervading(Sada Sarvagatah), it does not manifest everywhere.  It manifests only in the intellect like a reflection in an immaculate surface.   Buddhi is to Atman what a reflecting medium is to the Sun.  Sunlight is all-pervading.  It falls everywhere but the reflection of the Sun`s rays take place only in a reflecting surface.   When a reflecting medium is covered with dust or when it is disturbed , the reflection is not clear or  is distorted.   Similarly, when the intellect is veiled by ignorance or when the mind is agitated, the Atman expressing through the thoughts is also disturbed.  When ignorance  is removed from the intellect and the agitations are subdued, then in a perfectly serene and tranquil mind, the Atman is recognised.   Atman is said to be recognised objectively through the intellect.   Intellect is the last equipment which man utilises to come in contact with the Atma.  Here buddhi does not refer to the\n sense-bound intellect which is conditioned by the waking state, but that buddhi which has the light of Atma playing upon it.  Gita pronounces Atma as  Buddhigrayhyam Ateendriyam. It means &quot;grasped by the intellect but beyond the senses&quot;.   Buddhi refers to the philosophical reasoning faculty.  Vedanta holds that Buddhi or pure intellect is man`s most precious possession and that it should be kept bright and pure and that nothing should be indulged in, which weakens or destroys it. \n(to be continued) \nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n      \r\n--0-2140093172-1251682722=:37800\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;----- Forwarded Message ----&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; viprasamhitha@...&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, August 30, 2009 9:33:54 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; SOME THOUGHTS ON ATMA---4&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Great seers&nbsp; of Bharath(India)advise us to separate the pure innermost Self(Atma) from the enveloping sheaths through discriminative thinking, just as we separate rice&nbsp;bran &nbsp;and husk from the paddy by thrashing with a pestle.&nbsp;&nbsp; By withdrawing our identification with the matter layers\n we can regain our&nbsp;real and true &nbsp;nature of the Atman.&nbsp; The thrashing or pounding of the paddy suggess a comparison to the hard and gruelling experiences&nbsp; in the world which makes us more mature and introvert in life.&nbsp; Thus gradually, we&nbsp;\n come to detach ourselves from the physical body and the external world.&nbsp;&nbsp; When our mind turns introvert&nbsp; and if we take to discriminative self-analysis and logical thinking, &nbsp;we recognise the pure Atman beyond the layers of matter.&nbsp; With the help of the discriminatory faculty we&nbsp;should &nbsp;distinguish the real from the unreal.
