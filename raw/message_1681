In history we see that every ancient culture had=\r\n their own set of deities and rituals etc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; If deities are not univ=\r\nersal and rather culture specific, are they a creation of the people? But i=\r\nf they are a creation of the people, how do they have such universal abilit=\r\nies/powers and also their avatarts. We have in Sanatana Dharma many instanc=\r\nes of amsa avatars of various deities taking birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; What happens to th=\r\ne deities of a certain culture, once the culture has died and there is no o=\r\nne to worship that deity? And why did not the ancient deities of different =\r\ncultures protect those cultures from anihilation?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts on this=\r\n would be interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
