Such instanc=\r\nes are quoted by householders who are unwilling to leave their attachments,=\r\n for there is no reason why they should stick to household life after attai=\r\nning knowledge. For knowledge by its very nature is against all senses of w=\r\norldly duty and activity.\n\nThe sannyasin can find adequate leisure and free=\r\ndom from the distractions of life. Renunciation is desirable even to those =\r\nwho have not attained jnana. Only the sannyasin can devote the whole time f=\r\nor meditation. Householders cannot give themselves up completely for medita=\r\ntion. The very word =E2=80=9Chousehold=E2=80=9D signifies pravritti which i=\r\ns concerned with the world of appearance. \n\n\n"}}
