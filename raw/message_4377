I think my prep time takes less than 5 mins; the actual hom=\r\na takes\nme 45 - 50 mins. I also do a separate sadhana that takes me 20 mins=\r\n--so, all\ntogether, I spend 80-90 mins in the morning doing homa and sadhan=\r\na. These\nare the steps I follow for the homa:\n\nI keep the copper kunda in a=\r\nn aluminum tray, which rests upon two bricks on\nthe floor, and the two bric=\r\nks are on top of a folded heavy-duty black\ngarbage bag. I don&#39;t fuss much a=\r\nbout cleaning before and after each homa,\nbecause this arrangement protects=\r\n the floor, so just on the weekends, I\nclean it up properly by replacing / =\r\nemptying the tray, and vacuuming /\nwiping any residue. This havan &quot;area&quot; is=\r\n fixed and I do not remove it after\neach homa--it&#39;s like a fixed altar.\n\nNe=\r\nxt to the kunda area, I keep a small shrine where everything is laid out\nfo=\r\nr the daily homa. There is a small mandap for keeping the kalasha and\nvigra=\r\nhas, and in front, I keep a supply of the samagri needed for the puja\n(ghee=\r\n, aarti tray with diya and dhoop stand, kumkum, gandhan, agarbatti,\netc.), =\r\noil for the diya, matches and a tray full of coconut halves. (I do\nnot cut =\r\nthe coconut halves into strips for the homa; I just use one coconut\nhalf pe=\r\nr homa). This arrangement prevents having to gather and\narrange everything =\r\nfrom scratch each day.\n\nThe main kalasha I only exchange the water once a w=\r\neek; during the week, I\nlet the water accumulate the vrttis from the succes=\r\nsive homas.\n\nAccordingly, on any given day, all I have to do to prepare for=\r\n the homa is\nthe following: Empty the burnt offerings from the previous day=\r\n&#39;s homa (which\nI offer to my plants outside as &quot;fertilizer&quot;--they really th=\r\nrive on it!),\nfill the pancha patra with water, and cut a few flowers for t=\r\nhe homa\nofferings. I bring these back to the havan kund, fill the lamp with=\r\n oil and\na wick, arrange the vigrhas for that day&#39;s homa (I do homa to diff=\r\nerent\ndeities on different days), put the prasad in a little offering bowl,=\r\n and\ncan sit directly for homa. So, this whole procedure takes me less than=\r\n 5\nmins.\n\nI do not bother with melting the ghee, even though I live in cold=\r\n climes in\nEngland. I have a 1/2 kg container of ghee, that I use each day,=\r\n and I find\nthat after using it once, it stays in melted / liquidish form (=\r\nif homa is\ndone at least every 2-3 days) and once I bring the wooden spoon =\r\nto the kund\nand heat up the ghee, and go back to scoop some more ghee from =\r\nthe\ncontainer, the heat from the spoon does the rest of the melting. (Again=\r\n,\nmaybe this is not kosher and is &quot;wrong&quot; from a madi perspective, so pleas=\r\ne\ntake with a grain of salt.)\n\nFor prasad, I use nuts, and I also use nuts =\r\nfor the bali, so I do not spend\ntime preparing food or cutting fruit.\n\nI ha=\r\nve found this to be quite feasible to do on a daily basis--that, too,\nwhile=\r\n keeping a separate sadhana that takes an additonal 20-30 mins in the\nmorni=\r\nng and working a hectic 80+ hours / week job, so it can definitely be\ndone!=\r\n Just try it for a few days and I think you&#39;ll be able to come up with\nyour=\r\n own routine.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m not at all advising to follow what I do (because =\r\nmy shortcuts may\nbe wrong), but just wanted to share as a brainstorming ide=\r\na.\n\nWarm regards,\nAditi\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, May 21, 2010 at 10:00 AM, nagraj@sbcglo=\r\nbal.net\n&lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; As I practise H=\r\nomam more and more, I want to do it on a daily basis, but I\n&gt; want to know =\r\nhow to make it faster for a daily ritual.

I wonder if there is a homam for Kumara Swam=\r\ny. For the rest, there\n&gt; is one, if I am right, although I am not sure if t=\r\nhere is one exclusively\n&gt; for Lord Surya.
