Those who kno=\r\nw the \nritual may know that we pray to Loka palakas (Ganesha, Brahma etc), =\r\nnine \nplanets and rulers of directions as a part of Satya Narayana vratam. =\r\nThe \nfollowing text tries to explain the reason, i.e. what all those deitie=\r\ns \nstand for. Just for your information..\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyot=\r\nish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n               =\r\n       Twitter ID: @homam108\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n\nIn the field of duality, our consciousness operates =\r\ndue to three \naspects: (1) Astitva or identity =E2=80=93 sense of =E2=80=9C=\r\nI exist=E2=80=9D, (2) Bhoktritva or \nexperiencership =E2=80=93 sense of =E2=\r\n=80=9CI experience things=E2=80=9D, (3) Katritva or \ndoership =E2=80=93 sen=\r\nse of =E2=80=9CI do things=E2=80=9D.\n\nWe exist due to the five elements =E2=\r\n=80=93 earth (solid state of existence), \nwater (flexible state of existenc=\r\ne), fire (transformatory state of \nexistence), air (expansive state of exis=\r\ntence) and ether (existential \nspace behind all existence). These five elem=\r\nents are ruled by Ganapathi, \nBrahma, Lakshmi & Vishnu, Rudra and Gouri. So=\r\n we pray to them as they \ncontrol our astitva or identity.\n\nLiteral meaning=\r\n of =E2=80=9Cgraha=E2=80=9D is one that grabs. We experience things as \ngra=\r\nhas or planets grab our consciousness and make it experience the \nresults (=\r\nreactions) of various actions performed by us in the past. \nGrahas are the =\r\nagents of karma phala (fruits of previous actions). Thus, \ngrahas control o=\r\nur bhoktritva or experiencership. So we pray to them, \nwith ruling and co-r=\r\nuling deities.\n\nTen dikpalakas rule the ten directions (eight 2-dimensional=\r\n directions, \nup and down). They not only rule the physical directions, but=\r\n the \ndirection one takes in life with one&#39;s work. For example, in Vedic \na=\r\nstrology, a chart called dasamsa shows one&#39;s work in society and the \nten p=\r\narts of that chart are ruled by dikpalakas showing different kinds \nof work=\r\n. Indra, for example, shows work that asserts authority and \ncontrol over o=\r\nthers (e.g. political leaders, managers). Agni, for \nexample, shows work th=\r\nat transforms things (e.g. engineers, designers). \nYama shows work related =\r\nto enforcing rules (e.g. quality assurance, \npolice). Nirriti shows work th=\r\nat breaks barriers (e.g. mafia, cutting \nedge innovations). And so on. It i=\r\ns dikpalakas who control our kartritva \nor doership and make us perform dif=\r\nferent types of actions. So we pray \nto them.\n\n"}}
