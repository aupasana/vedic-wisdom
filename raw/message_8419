The modified version\n&gt; applies a=\r\n lot to us, fools lost in oblivion trying to learn more and\n&gt; more and more=\r\n theories instead of doing sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quoted with modifications pertaini=\r\nng to Mr God.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;There was a young man, you know, who wanted to reach =\r\ngod/be super\n&gt; siddha or something and so he went to this guru. The guru wa=\r\ns very very\n&gt; advanced, a legend in his own right. And he told the guru you=\r\n know I\n&gt; wanna be on the same level you are and the guru said if you wanna=\r\n be on\n&gt; the same level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met you tomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\n the young man got there 4 A.M. he was  all ready to rock n&#39; roll.\n&gt; He was=\r\n dressed properly, but he should have worn shorts. The old man\n&gt; grabs his =\r\nhand and said: How bad do you wanna be successful (basically\n&gt; achieve god,=\r\n have siddhi and the like, all references to success from\n&gt; hereon now mean=\r\n uniting with god) ? He said: &quot;Real bad&quot;. He\n&gt; said: Walk on out in the wat=\r\ner. So he walks out into the water. When he\n&gt; walks out to the water he goe=\r\ns waist deep and goes like this old man is\n&gt; crazy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The young man was =\r\nthinking , &quot;Hey I wanna meet god, achieve siddhi in my\n&gt; sadhana, get out o=\r\nf this birth death cycle etc. etc. and this foolish\n&gt; old man got me out he=\r\nre swimming. I didn&#39;t ask to be a lifeguard. I\n&gt; wanna meet god he got me i=\r\nn water =96 so the old man said go on a\n&gt; little further =96 the young man =\r\nwalked out a little further =96\n&gt; then the young man was neck deep in water=\r\n - the young man was thinking \n&gt; this old man is crazy =96 everybody calls =\r\nhim a paramhansa, a\n&gt; mahapurusha, god incarnate but he is definitely crazy=\r\n. So the old man\n&gt; again said go on out a little further =96 the young man =\r\nwent out a\n&gt; little further, the water was now right at his mouth =96the yo=\r\nung man\n&gt; was now thinking of going back, this old hack is out of his fucki=\r\nng\n&gt; mind. And then the old man said: &quot;I thought you said you wanted to\n&gt; b=\r\ne successful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &quot;Then walk a\n&gt; little further.&quot; Th=\r\nen the old man followed this guy into the water,\n&gt; he grabbed the young man=\r\n&#39;s head, and held him down underwater. The old\n&gt; guy held the young man, ti=\r\nll  the young man was about to pass out, the\n&gt; young guys arms were now spl=\r\nashing the water in desperation, then\n&gt; suddenly the guru raised him up. He=\r\n said: &quot;I got a question for\n&gt; you.&quot; He told the young guy, he said: &quot;When =\r\nyou want to succeed\n&gt; as bad as you wanna breathe than you will be successf=\r\nul.&quot;\n&gt; (Succeed =3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or achieving supernatu=\r\nral\n&gt; powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I d=\r\non&#39;t know how many of you all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If\n&gt; you eve=\r\nr had a asthma attack before, you are short of breath S.O.B,due\n&gt; to shortn=\r\ness of breath, you start wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like you\n&gt; have run 10,0=\r\n00kms in one go, the only thing you are trying to do at\n&gt; that moment durin=\r\ng the attack, is get some air. You don&#39;t care about\n&gt; no basketball game, y=\r\nou don&#39;t care about what&#39;s on T.V., you\n&gt; don&#39;t care about nobody calling y=\r\nou, you don&#39;t care about a\n&gt; party. The only thing you care about when you =\r\ntrying to breathe is to\n&gt; get some fresh air. That&#39;s it! And when you get t=\r\no the point where\n&gt; all you wanna do is be is successful as bad as you wann=\r\na breathe then\n&gt; you will be successful. And I&#39;m here to tell you that numb=\r\ner one,\n&gt; most of you say you wanna be successful but you don&#39;t want it bad=\r\n,\n&gt; you just kind of want it. You don&#39;t want it bad than you wanna\n&gt; party.=\r\n You don&#39;t want it as much as you want to be cool. Most of you\n&gt; don&#39;t want=\r\n success as much as you want sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; (Again Success =3D uniting wit=\r\nh god, or seeing god, or achieving\n&gt; supernatural powers, or siddhi, or wha=\r\ntever, thats subjective, upto\n&gt; you.)\n&gt; End Quote\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignore the following=\r\n video , focus on the audio in it. with the above\n&gt; modifications.\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU_J0A\n&gt; \n&gt; Do all of you remember that Vis=\r\na call from your perspective\n&gt; embassies????\n&gt; Remember those???\n&gt; The inte=\r\nrviews???\n&gt; Even if you had slept at 4 in the morning, the night before, yo=\r\nu would\n&gt; still wake up and be at the embassy office at 7, or whenever your=\r\n\n&gt; appointment was.\n&gt; Hell even if you had high fever 102 or something, you=\r\n would still reach.\n&gt; Do you remember that flight to the states???\n&gt; Ohhhh =\r\nAmmmerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!!

Some girl a=\r\nfter seeing it did, and has always\n&gt; been a little urgent with her sadhana =\r\never since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; I see this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do=\r\n you find a\n&gt; guru????&quot;\n&gt; And you know everyone, wants a high powered one, =\r\nnot any other will do.\n&gt; See a high powered guru, also requires a good disc=\r\niple.\n&gt; Are you good enough, honestly answer this??? Many will say no, many=\r\n will\n&gt; say good or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it etc etc, but ar=\r\ne you\n&gt; willing to work on yourself to spare the guru some work???? Why wou=\r\nld a\n&gt; high powered one come and teach you??? only after your penance is go=\r\nod\n&gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy in his/her union with god.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Now how bad do you want god?\n&gt; How bad do you want a guru?\n&gt;   How b=\r\nad do you want those spiritual states?\n&gt; How bad do you want the darsahn fo=\r\nr your beloved?\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time is running ou=\r\nt, and very soon,\n&gt; another rebirth, again the young age, again the teenage=\r\n, again the\n&gt; affairs, again the hormone spikes, again the degrees, again t=\r\nhe sucky\n&gt; jobs, again confused with life, again the financial nightmares, =\r\nagain\n&gt; the heart attacks , again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll end this post with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the\n&gt; 19=\r\n40&#39;s, had done a bit of penance and you know was highly interested in\n&gt; god=\r\n , shod and all this stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and\n&gt; met a=\r\n guy who was proclaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord\n&gt; voldmeort=\r\n or something but on the god side.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the guy went to meet the guy who=\r\nse name can&#39;t be taken and asked him\n&gt; , i am looking for a guru, the old f=\r\nella said , for what exactly are you\n&gt; looking for a guru??? The business m=\r\nan said, , you know to learn stuff.\n&gt; The old fellow said what are you will=\r\ning to do for your guru??? The\n&gt; businessman said anything. The old fella s=\r\naid, okay take all your\n&gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the sui=\r\nt guy took them off\n&gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a pa=\r\ntta around your\n&gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The businessman was =\r\naghast, but the\n&gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the businessman =\r\nvery BADLY\n&gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got shoes thrown at him, came ba=\r\nck after\n&gt; half an hour to find the old fella gone and his clothes gone too=\r\n. He sat\n&gt; there sobbing, and sobbing and cursing god, that i was the bigge=\r\nst fool\n&gt; to come here and trust this man. But then as he haid read somewhe=\r\nre, why\n&gt; waste time, he started meditating and chanted. 3 hours went by no=\r\n sign\n&gt; of the old man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, the old fella reappeared, =\r\nand\n&gt; said &quot; here are your clothes, go back to your town.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The busines=\r\nsman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to get up, but\n&gt; couldn&#39;t move.=\r\n The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that finally\n&gt; he has found so=\r\nmeone worthy enough to teach.
