Rao pvr108@...:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Namaste Sri Shanmukha Sivacharyar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A year consists of mont=\r\nhs and a month consist of days. If one uses\n&gt; years,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; months and days =\r\n*consistently*, all years should start with a\n&gt; particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; month and =\r\nend with particular month and all months should start\nwith\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; partic=\r\nular day and end with a particular day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But that is broken if o=\r\nne mixes tithis (lunar days or rather\n&gt; soli-lunar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days) with months =\r\nof souramaana. One month may start on Sukla\n&gt; Ashtami and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another mon=\r\nth on Sukla Chaturthi. How logical is that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; E=\r\nven the chaandramana calculations we follow today may be\nimperfect.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; For example, ask a simple question: Why were the twelve months\nnamed\n&gt;=\r\n that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaitra month starts when Moon and Sun are tog=\r\nether in Meena\n&gt; (Poorvabhadra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4th pada, Uttarabhadra, Revati). Why i=\r\ns it named Chaitra? Vaisakha\n&gt; month\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starts when Moon and Sun are tog=\r\nether in Mesha (Aswini, Bharani,\n&gt; Krittika\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1st pada). Why is it name=\r\nd Vaisakha? Jyeshtha month starts when\nMoon\n&gt; and Sun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are together in=\r\n Vrishabha (Krittika 2nd, 3rd and 4th padas,\nRohini,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mrigasira 1st an=\r\nd 2nd padas). Why is it named Jyeshtha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you look carefully, =\r\nthe names of the months are based on stars\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Chita-Chaitra, Visakha-Va=\r\nisakha, Jyeshtha-Jyeshtha etc). Starting\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chitra, 12 out of 27 =\r\nstars are picked for the names of months. At\n&gt; the time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Full Moon =\r\nin Chaitra month, Moon moves by 180 degrees compared\nto\n&gt; where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he wa=\r\ns at the beginning of the month (Meena) and is around Chitra\n&gt; star. At\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the time of Full Moon in Vaisakha month, Moon moves by 180 degrees\n&gt; com=\r\npared\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to where he was at the beginning of the month (Mesha) and is\nar=\r\nound\n&gt; Visakha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; star. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is logical to guess th=\r\nat the zodiac was divided into 12 equal\n&gt; parts (not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily alig=\r\nned to the twelve rasis) and the name of a month\nis\n&gt; decided\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based o=\r\nn the star occupied by Moon at the middle of the month,\ni.e.\n&gt; at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n time of Full Moon. A prominent star was chosen in the twelve equal\n&gt; parts=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the month was named based on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\nooladhara chakra is in the middle of the body and it is the basis\n&gt; of our\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; existence. The chakras at the top of the head or the bottom of the\n&gt; =\r\nfeet are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not taken as the base. In astrology, zodiac is decided by th=\r\ne\nChitra\n&gt; star,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i.e. Chitra star is perfectly aligned to the *middle=\r\n* of the\nzodiac.\n&gt; We do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not fix the beginning of the zodiac by the e=\r\nxact location of\nAswini\n&gt; star,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but by taking 180 degrees from the ex=\r\nact location of Chitra star.\n&gt; Similarly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is possible that a month=\r\n is named based on the star occupied at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *middle* of the month r=\r\nather than the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the current mo=\r\nnth started as per soli-lunar (chaandramaana)\n&gt; calendar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on January 1=\r\n5, Sun and Moon were in Capricorn. So it is called\n&gt; &quot;Maagha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maasa&quot; b=\r\nased on current conventions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, Pournima of that month is=\r\n running right now and Moon is\nin\n&gt; the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pada of Pushya star right=\r\n now. He is far from Magha star. Is this\n&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maagha Pournima as =\r\npeople think?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My personal view is that it is Pushya Pournima ri=\r\nght now and Feb\n11\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi and not MahaaShivar=\r\naatri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a new month as per Chaandramaana starts on February=\r\n 13,\npeople\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider it as Phalguna maasa because Moon and Sun are in=\r\n Kumbha.\n&gt; But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next Pournima on February 28 coincides with Magha =\r\nnakshatra. I\n&gt; suggest that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; THAT is the real Maagha Pournima. So Marc=\r\nh 13 is the Maagha\nKrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShivaraatri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline: I agree with the conclusion of souramaan=\r\na proponents\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular time, but for a different reason compa=\r\nred to theirs. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; respectfully suggest that we are all lacking in our =\r\nunderstanding\nof\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correct calendar used with tithi based festiva=\r\nls. We celebrate\n&gt; festivals on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the correct days most of the times, b=\r\nut make mistakes now and\nthen.\n&gt; Some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; misunderstandings still need to=\r\n be corrected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good thing is that the knowledge of rishis is se=\r\nlf-revealing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-correcting. If one is sincere and applies onese=\r\nlf, one can\nfind\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritin=\r\ngs\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
