If you look at the nights before Vijaya Dasami, then there are t=\r\nen nights instead of nine this year. This happens sometimes.\n \nIf you live =\r\non US east coast, then Chaturthi comes twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2=\r\n & 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and extended into Friday. Panchami was=\r\n on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday=\r\n (Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).\n =\r\n\nIf one&#39;s parents did not do a proper &quot;anna praasana&quot; ritual (the ritual of=\r\n first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, should one consider oneself=\r\n not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a mantra because of no initi=\r\nation is basically like that.\n \nGetting initiation is good, especially if t=\r\nhe one initiating has some level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neith=\r\ner necessary nor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana.\n \nIf y=\r\nou see my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A millionaire may ope=\r\nn a bank account in his son&#39;s name with a starting balance of a million dol=\r\nlars. This is akin to a good guru initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya s=\r\ntarts off by getting some of guru&#39;s attainment. But the son may waste those=\r\n million dollars and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and=\r\n not achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to give money and=\r\n may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions of dollars =\r\nwith own effort. This is akin to a person doing sadhana with a mantra witho=\r\nut guru and attaining some level in the mantra.\n \nSome people hold the view=\r\n that mantras cannot be chanted without a proper &quot;initiation&quot;. This view is=\r\n especially prevalent in some sections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. Ho=\r\nwever, I disagree with that view.\n \nIf you know the mantra (!), just chant =\r\nit. What would an initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve gi=\r\nven some of his attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourse=\r\nlf if you work hard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taught you the right nyasas to be d=\r\none before the mantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. Moreove=\r\nr, what most people do today for nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no mea=\r\nning. Nyasa literally means placement. You place various sounds in various =\r\nbody parts (like the tips of various fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc)=\r\n. People merely act out some signals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placeme=\r\nnt&quot; is actually supposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal envi=\r\nronment for the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what is =\r\nsupposed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds end up n=\r\not getting properly placed in the body. In other words, what I am trying to=\r\n say is that most people do not know how to &quot;place&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in var=\r\nious body parts. They merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, i=\r\nf you do not know nyasas, you are not really missing much compared to other=\r\ns who were initiated.\n \nIn my humble opinion, the most important qualificat=\r\nion is to have devotion and sense of surrender to Her. If you have them, yo=\r\nu can consider yourself &quot;highly initiated&quot;.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n  From: Chandra Prakash \n  To: vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm \n  Sent: Sunday, October 05, 2008 11:16 PM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Nava=\r\nratri...\n\n\n  Dear Narasimha,\n\n  When does Navratri end?
