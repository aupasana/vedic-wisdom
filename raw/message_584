T=\r\nhey symbolize the path of shakti moving from you to the \nfire and vice vers=\r\na.\n\n(3) Either is fine.\n\n(4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas u=\r\nsed in a pooja, everything \nhas a purpose and it has to go when its purpose=\r\n is served. That&#39;s the nature \nof life. While the flowers and akshatas are =\r\nused in homam, they are \nsacrosanct and should be handled with care, love a=\r\nnd respect. After they \nserve their purpose, they have to be disposed of ho=\r\nwever one can. Throwing \nin garbage is fine if you ask me. Another way is t=\r\no collect them in a bag \nuntil you accumulate a good amount and burn them o=\r\nneday. If you have a local \ntemple, you can go and see if you can throw the=\r\nm wherever they throw the \nflowers etc they use at the temple.\n\nThe ashes f=\r\nrom the homam are considered sacred. They contain *some* of the \nenergy gen=\r\nerated from the homam. The best way to dispose the ashes is to \nthrow them =\r\ninto a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean). This \nensures that th=\r\ne energy is not localized to one place and is distributed \nback to the Natu=\r\nre. Another thing some people do is to dig a deep pit in the \nyard and bury=\r\n the ashes. It restricts the energy to the place and not a \ngreat idea. Ple=\r\nase remember that the energy in the ashes is only a *part* of \nthe energy g=\r\nenerated. Some energy is also within the person performing homam \nand helps=\r\n to purify the person.
