Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna\n&gt; shrine=\r\n with a beautiful Krishna idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there\n&gt; som=\r\netimes. Due to an accident when another priest was carrying the idol\n&gt; duri=\r\nng a festival, the idol broke oneday.\n&gt;\n&gt; The priests and the highly learne=\r\nd scholars were in a quandary and\n&gt; conferred to decide what to do. The sha=\r\nstras were clear that a broken idol\n&gt; could not be worshipped at a temple a=\r\nnd had to be immersed in flowing water.\n&gt; So the learned scholars recommend=\r\ned immersing the idol in Ganges.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramakrishna was asked by the temple ad=\r\nministration for his view. He thought\n&gt; for a while and said calmly, &quot;Suppo=\r\nse you have a son and his leg is broken.\n&gt; Will you try to fix it and keep =\r\nthe son at home and continue to love him or\n&gt; will you throw your son into =\r\nGanges?&quot; His simple common sense view prevailed\n&gt; and shastras were set asi=\r\nde! In fact, Ramakrishna himself fixed the broken\n&gt; idol. It was re-install=\r\ned at the temple and continued to be worshipped.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; The idol was in your house for 56 years. Suddenly, the new found knowledg=\r\ne\n&gt; is creating problems in your mind, after all these years! What good is =\r\nthat\n&gt; knowledge which spoils mental peace by creating doubts, fear and ins=\r\necurity?\n&gt; One is better off being ignorant than having such knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n If you have an idol that was worshipped to some extent by your ancestors\n&gt;=\r\n for 56 years, it would&#39;ve captured and stored some of the positive energy\n=\r\n&gt; and positive thoughts of those people. It would be a great blessing to ha=\r\nve\n&gt; at your house.\n&gt;\n&gt; It should not be a problem if you cannot do much ri=\r\ntual worshp to the idol.\n&gt; Just doing simple things should suffice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whe=\r\nnever you see the idol, imagine that there is Ganesha in it for real.\n&gt; Lov=\r\ne the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bow to him now and then, when you get a\n&gt;=\r\n chance. Show some fruit or raisins or something to the idol now and then,\n=\r\n&gt; when you get a chance, and imagine that Ganesa tasted them. Every few\n&gt; m=\r\nonths, clean the idol in water and wipe it (to keep it clean).\n&gt;\n&gt; The key =\r\nis not how detailed your rituals are and whether you are doing 5 or\n&gt; 16 or=\r\n 64 or more services in your ritual. The key is how strongly you\n&gt; imagine =\r\na real deity in that idol and how deeply you love that real deity\n&gt; that yo=\r\nu visualize in the idol. Rituals are only meant to facilitate such a\n&gt; visu=\r\nalization and increase such a love. They are neither necessary nor\n&gt; suffic=\r\nient for establishing a relationship with a deity (which is, after\n&gt; all, t=\r\nhe purpose of keeping an idol)!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; How does a meta=\r\nllic (or stone or whatever) object become divine?\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, each objec=\r\nt and each atom of this universe is filled, in\n&gt; essence, by Aatman or Brah=\r\nman, i.e. non-dual god. But, that would apply to\n&gt; the idol as well as a so=\r\nfa. But you look at an idol as being more divine\n&gt; than the sofa. So we are=\r\n not talking about the all-pervading non-dual god\n&gt; here. We are talking ab=\r\nout a deity within the field of duality here. That\n&gt; deity is not present i=\r\nn sofa, but present in the idol. But, how does the\n&gt; deity get into the ido=\r\nl? Does the idol get that deity in it simply because\n&gt; of its shape? Of cou=\r\nrse not!\n&gt;\n&gt; All lokas and all devatas are present within you in a microcos=\r\nmic form. By\n&gt; the force of your thought, you concentrate a part of the dei=\r\nty who is within\n&gt; you into the idol (or any object). When a priest with a =\r\ngood level of purity\n&gt; and good ability to visualize (which comes from inte=\r\nrnal purity and lack of\n&gt; ego) does praana pratishthaa in an idol, his visu=\r\nalization works using the\n&gt; praana pratishthaa mantra as an instrument and =\r\na deity&#39;s essence enters the\n&gt; idol.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if you do not do a praana pra=\r\ntishthaa formally, deity&#39;s essence will\n&gt; slowly be established in the idol=\r\n if you keep imagining deity in the idol.\n&gt; It is all about the power of th=\r\nought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not\n&gt; weighed down by a dense and he=\r\navy ego and not colored by too many terrible\n&gt; vaasanaas work faster, but e=\r\nven thoughts of an impure mind that is weighed\n&gt; down by a dense and heavy =\r\nego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will\n&gt; also work, albeit slow=\r\nly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities\n&gt; in an idol over a l=\r\nong time, essence of such a deity will invariably be\n&gt; established in the i=\r\ndol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic\n&gt; object.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you im=\r\nagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care of\n&gt; him, you =\r\nwill slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this\n&gt; negativity.=\r\n Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy and saattwika form with\n&gt; whom you ca=\r\nn fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when\n&gt; you see th=\r\ne idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity&#39;s anger), it will\n&gt; indeed cr=\r\neate such a presence in the idol and do you good.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; There are several *well-meaning* people out there with half-baked\n&gt; unde=\r\nrstanding that is not based on any direct experience, who go around\n&gt; scari=\r\nng people in several matters relating to god, religion and\n&gt; spirituality. =\r\nBut god is not to be feared.\n&gt;\n&gt; Love god. Do not fear god. When your fathe=\r\nr or mother shout at you or\n&gt; punish you, it is for a good reason and it wi=\r\nll eventually be for your good.\n&gt; They are not really angry at you and they=\r\n actually love you. Similarly, when\n&gt; god punishes you or gives bad results=\r\n, it is for a good reason and it will\n&gt; eventually be for your good. Do not=\r\n fear god even when god gives you bad\n&gt; results. Always *love* god and love=\r\n god very deeply. More deeply than you\n&gt; love your parents, spouse, childre=\r\nn etc. That is a simple principle for\n&gt; sureshot spiritual progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Go=\r\nod luck with your Ganesha idol no matter what you decide to do with it!\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Ram =\r\nR&quot; &lt;mantra2379@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: We=\r\ndnesday, September 02, 2009 1:22 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Right-sided T=\r\nrunk Shri Ganesha Idol\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear All=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This ia my first posting in this forum.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am writing in as =\r\nam in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which\n&gt; we found during =\r\npuja in our home.

As it has been there for so long in the house we are feeling hes=\r\nitant\n&gt; about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have advic=\r\ne as to\n&gt; what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about doing t=\r\nhe same.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for =\r\nsuch a query.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Ramesh M\n&gt; &gt; Bangalore\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e64764d0542dba0472b02a5d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: comic=\r\n sans ms,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Respected Narasihma ji,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;color: rgb=\r\n(51, 51, 255); font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;color: =\r\nrgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;c=\r\nolor: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;When I read=\r\n Shri Ram ji&#39;s mail and some responses from fellow members, I wished to=\r\n write him saying please don&#39;t immerse Lord Ganesha&#39;s idol.

But, that would apply to the \nidol as well as a sofa. But you look at an=\r\n idol as being more divine than the \nsofa. So we are not talking about the =\r\nall-pervading non-dual god here. We are \ntalking about a deity within the f=\r\nield of duality here. That deity is not \npresent in sofa, but present in th=\r\ne idol. But, how does the deity get into the \nidol? Does the idol get that =\r\ndeity in it simply because of its shape? Of course \nnot!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;All lokas and all devatas are present within you in a microcosmi=\r\nc form. By \nthe force of your thought, you concentrate a part of the deity =\r\nwho is within you \ninto the idol (or any object). When a priest with a good=\r\n level of purity and \ngood ability to visualize (which comes from internal =\r\npurity and lack of ego) \ndoes praana pratishthaa in an idol, his visualizat=\r\nion works using the praana \npratishthaa mantra as an instrument and a deity=\r\n&#39;s essence enters the idol.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Even if you do=\r\n not do a praana pratishthaa formally, deity&#39;s essence will \nslowly be =\r\nestablished in the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is \nall=\r\n about the power of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed do=\r\nwn \nby a dense and heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas=\r\n work \nfaster, but even thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed dow=\r\nn by a dense \nand heavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will =\r\nalso work, \nalbeit=C2=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qua=\r\nlities in an idol \nover a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will inva=\r\nriably be established in \nthe idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a m=\r\netallic object.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;If you imagine a deity who is =\r\nangry with you for not taking good care of \nhim, you will slowly create suc=\r\nh a form in that idol. Please stop this \nnegativity. Imagine a beautiful, p=\r\nleasant, happy=C2=A0and saattwika form with \nwhom you can fall in love. If =\r\na feeling of love overwhelms your mind when you \nsee the idol (instead of t=\r\nhoughts of fear and deity&#39;s anger), it will indeed \ncreate such a prese=\r\nnce in the idol and do you good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;There=\r\n are several *well-meaning* people out there \nwith half-baked understanding=\r\n that is not based on any direct experience, who go \naround scaring people =\r\nin several matters relating to god, religion and \nspirituality.

Do not fear god even=\r\n when god gives you bad \nresults. Always *love* god and love god very deepl=\r\ny.

I recently came to know that when an idol of Sh=\r\nri Ganesha \nwith its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worshi=\r\np it daily in a \ndedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this al=\r\nl these years. It was \ninfact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as p=\r\ner my father who has been \nseeing it since then. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I feel t=\r\nhat it is better to donate it to \na temple which would worship it daily. As=\r\n it has been there for so long in the \nhouse we are feeling hesitant about =\r\ndoing this. Would be extremely grateful if I \ncould have advice as to what =\r\nwould be the correct thing to do and how to go \nabout doing the same.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Kindly pardon me if this is not the \nappropriate forum for such=\r\n a query.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ramesh \nM&lt;br&gt;&gt; Bangalore &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n    \n    &lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: w=\r\nhite; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0016e64764d0542dba0472b02a5d--\r\n\n"}}
