I int=\r\nended to do the 13 chapters end to end but had to restrict my self to the 1=\r\nst,4th,5th and the 11th Chapters primarly because the homam was generating =\r\nlot of smoke and I had a few occassions in the past where there were compla=\r\nins raised by neighbours regarding the smoke. I used different 5 different =\r\nkinds of fruits along with flattened rice, puffed rice , raisins and dried =\r\ncocunuts. Next time onwards I plan to stick to only dried cocunuts and a fe=\r\nw other dry items so that the smoke can be restricted. \nWhile meditating I =\r\nsaw flashes of violet colour and I kept seeing the images of the devi&#39;s fac=\r\ne (a rather serious one at that ) constantly munching on something. The ver=\r\ny thought that Chandi was in the fire in the homa kundam gave me goose pimp=\r\nles all over and I was thinking again and again whether I am doing enough t=\r\no give my best to her. In the end I felt as if the divine mother was consol=\r\ning me telling that its OK not to be 100% perfect but atleast you tried. Wi=\r\nth the Ganapathi Homam I feel as if Ganesha is someone who plays around wit=\r\nh you just like a child and so do you with him. But with Chandi I felt as i=\r\nf I was talking to someone very mature and I felt like a complete idiot not=\r\n knowing what to do next and stumbling at every step.\nNot sure whether this=\r\n is how everyone else feels as well. I would like to know the feelings of t=\r\nhe other masters in this group regarding their first Chandi homam experienc=\r\ne.\n\nThanks and Regards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
