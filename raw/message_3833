It is the summit, accessible by a thorny path that has =\r\nsteps, slippery steps. I have ascended them step by step, the hard way; but=\r\n at every step I have experienced God coming into my life and lifting me ea=\r\nsily to the next step.\n\nMy father was fond of ceremonial worship (puja) in =\r\nwhich he was very regular. To my child-mind, the image he worshipped was Go=\r\nd; and I delighted in helping father in the worship, by bringing him flower=\r\ns and other articles of worship. The deep inner satisfaction that he and I =\r\nderived from such worship implanted in my heart the deep conviction that Go=\r\nd is in such images devoutly worshipped by His devotees. Thus did God come =\r\ninto my life first and placed my foot on the first rung of the ladder.\n\nGro=\r\nwing up\n\nAs an adult, I was fond of gymnastics and vigorous exercises. I le=\r\narnt fencing from a teacher who belonged to a low caste; he was a harijan. =\r\nI could go to him only for a few days before I was made to understand that =\r\nit was unbecoming of a caste Brahman to play the student to an untouchable.=\r\n I thought deeply over the matter. One moment I felt that the God whom we a=\r\nll worshipped in the image in my father&#39;s puja-room had jumped over to the =\r\nheart of this untouchable. He was my guru, all right! So I immediately went=\r\n to him with flowers, sweets and cloth, and garlanded him, placed flowers a=\r\nt his feet and prostrated myself before him. Thus did God come into my life=\r\n to remove the veil of caste-distinctions.\n\nHow very valuable this step was=\r\n I could realize very soon after this: for I was to enter the medical profe=\r\nssion and serve all, and the persistence of caste-distinction would have ma=\r\nde that service a mockery. With this mist cleared by the light of God, it w=\r\nas easy and natural for me to serve everyone. I took very keen delight in e=\r\nvery kind of service connected with healing and alleviation of human misery=\r\n. If there was a good prescription for malaria, I felt that the whole world=\r\n should know it the next moment. Any knowledge about the prevention of dise=\r\nases, promotion of health and healing of diseases, I was eager to acquire a=\r\nnd share with all.\n\nThen, God came into my life in the form of the sick in =\r\nMalaya. It is difficult for me now to single out any instance; and perhaps =\r\nit is unnecessary. Time and space are concepts of the mind and have no mean=\r\ning in God. I can look back now upon the whole period of my stay in Malaya =\r\nas a single event in which God came to me in the form of the sick and the s=\r\nuffering. People are sick physically and mentally. To some, life is lingeri=\r\nng death; and to some others, death is more welcome than life. Some lead a =\r\nmiserable life, unable to face death; some invite death and commit suicide,=\r\n unable to face life. The aspiration grew within me that if God had not mad=\r\ne this world merely as a hell where wicked people would be thrown, to suffe=\r\nr, and if there is (as I intuitively felt there should be) something other =\r\nthan this misery and this helpless existence, it should be known and experi=\r\nenced.\n\nConscious search for God\n\nIt was at this crucial point in my life t=\r\nhat God came to me as a religious mendicant who gave me the first lesson in=\r\n Vedanta. The positive aspects of life here, and real end and aim of human =\r\nlife, were made apparent. This drew me from Malaya to the Himalaya. God cam=\r\ne to me in the form of all-consuming aspiration to realize Him as the Self =\r\nof all.\n\nMeditation and service went on apace; and with them came various s=\r\npiritual experiences. The body, mind and intellect, as the limiting adjunct=\r\ns, vanished; and the whole universe shone as His Light. God then came in th=\r\ne form of this Light in which everything assumed a divine shape; and pain a=\r\nnd suffering, that seem to haunt everybody, appeared to be a mirage, the il=\r\nlusion that ignorance creates, on account of low sensual appetites that lur=\r\nk in man.\n\nOne more milestone had to be passed in order to know &quot;Sarvam Kha=\r\nlvidam Brahma.&quot; Early in 1950 (on the 8th Jan.) God came to me in the form =\r\nof a half-demented assailant, who disturbed the night satsanga at the ashra=\r\nm. His attempt failed. I bowed to him, worshipped him and sent him home. Ev=\r\nil exists to glorify the good! Evil is a superficial appearance; beneath it=\r\ns veil, the one Self shines in all.\n\nA noteworthy fact ought to be mentione=\r\nd here. In this evolution nothing gained previously is entirely discarded a=\r\nt any later stage. One coalesced into the next; and the Yoga of Synthesis w=\r\nas the fruit. Murti-puja, selfless service of the sick, meditation, the cul=\r\ntivation of cosmic love that transcended the barriers of caste, creed and r=\r\neligion, with the ultimate aim of attaining Cosmic Consciousness, was revea=\r\nled. This knowledge had immediately to be shared. All this had become an in=\r\ntegral part of my being.\n\nThe mission had been gathering strength and sprea=\r\nding. It was in 1950 that I undertook the All-India Tour. Then God came to =\r\nme in His virat-svarupa, multitudes of devotees, eager to listen to the ten=\r\nets of divine life. At every centre I felt that God spoke through me, and H=\r\ne Himself in His virat-form spread out before me as the multitude, listened=\r\n to me. He sang with me; He prayed with me; He spoke and He listened. Sarva=\r\nm Khalvidam Brahma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
