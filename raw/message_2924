I have done almost all the courses (few many times over) and list=\r\nened to the spiritual discourses tapes by Guruji Sri Sri Ravishankar.\nI&#39;m c=\r\nurrently working on becoming a teacher/facilitator.\n\nYou can consider such =\r\nspiritual organization(s) or groups as a Hand Rail while climbing the stair=\r\ncase. \nIf its dark around you and you have no clue about how many steps the=\r\nre are etc., - You can do it without holding on to anything, bump into some=\r\nthing, etc., - or you can reach to hold the hand rail and go where it takes=\r\n you.\nAt some point you&#39;ll also have to let go the hand rail and continue y=\r\nour path as well.\n\nArt of Living gives you a set of tools and techniques to=\r\n help be yourself - open yourself to the world around you. Have a company o=\r\nf good people, good sattwic practices, rich wisdom and knowledge, good tips=\r\n to a healthy body,mind and productive life.\n\nMany people do get caught up =\r\nin the course fees and doubts about where the money is being used/funneled =\r\netc.,\nArt of Living does not have any deep pocketed donors who can fund the=\r\n immense amount of humanitarian projects. Every dollar comes from contribut=\r\nions from members who have taken the courses.\n\nYes, all these courses can b=\r\ne free or inexpensive - but how do we view schools or colleges that are ine=\r\nxpensive. We become better learners, when we actually invest in the courses=\r\n, take ownership and be responsible. You can pay for it or in olden days, t=\r\nhe students would do some work at the ashram to &quot;pay&quot; for the knowledge.\n\nI=\r\n&#39;ll leave you with a final thought.\n\nMeditate now or Medicate later.\n\nShrik=\r\nanth\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; Can anybody tell me how good is the Art of Living cou=\r\nrse for our spiritual growth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
