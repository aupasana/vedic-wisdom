I vaguely remember Vimalananda m=\r\nentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.\n(2) On similar=\r\n note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We=\r\n also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or =\r\nsay Shwetarka Ganapati =96 what do this items really do if they work? Somet=\r\nhing similar with wearing gemstones for planets =96 do they bring forward g=\r\nood karmas or they create new ones?\n(3) I recollect an episode from famous =\r\n&quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cri=\r\ned out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship=\r\n God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but lat=\r\ner tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth.=\r\n [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to rec=\r\nollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadha=\r\nna change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that cha=\r\nnges?\nThanking you,\nDigamber\n\n\n\n"}}
