Even th=\r\ne worst Asura is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons only =\r\nShe knows, because Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpest h=\r\numan mind. Nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She is =\r\ntruly the One whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She lies =\r\nhidden inside it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discovered,=\r\n extending Her love, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who calls =\r\nHer sincerely and unconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liberty =\r\nto act as per its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the appa=\r\nrently bad. \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;Does=C2=A0She needs some visa \n&gt; to go there if she is=\r\n=C2=A0not the Creater.=C2=A0As you say all higher deity are \n&gt; there but le=\r\nss in ability. Does the deities have even less =C2=A0ability on \n&gt; earth pl=\r\nane.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; She needs no visa, but neither does She interfere without a gen=\r\nuine cause or a genuine call. Everything is Her world, then why is there ug=\r\nliness, crime, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if not She? And it is S=\r\nhe herself who gave them the liberty to act as per their freewill. This wor=\r\nld is a play of forces and a democracy of opportunities. Every impulse, how=\r\never Divine or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to run its course and =\r\nactualize itself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Compassion! That is wh=\r\ny She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Great Gods as much to th=\r\ne Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pretas and other corrup=\r\nt human being and what not. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now coming to your question on the phrase=\r\n &quot;higher deities having less ability&quot;. I think I have not been able to expl=\r\nain clearly, since in the last mail I was merely writing in the context of =\r\nthat discussion. Let me try here.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are three basic layer of this =\r\nUniverse. The physical, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (karana =\r\njagat) layer. In this subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own phys=\r\nical plane, there is a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like i=\r\nn our own world. It is a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti=\r\n. This force of pranashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive mov=\r\nements on the consciousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, fear, an=\r\nger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of =\r\ninfluencing the thinking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and=\r\n specially Tantrik sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using one=\r\ns own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and m=\r\nantras etc. If you think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever =\r\nhoma agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka us=\r\ned the force of his/her own\n&gt;  pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle for=\r\nmation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this sublte fo=\r\nrmation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its ow=\r\nn. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day l=\r\nead him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyon=\r\nd this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakt=\r\ni, and make it identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, it be=\r\ncomes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human perspectiv=\r\ne, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the act=\r\nual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda=\r\n in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; When a sadhaka has=\r\n been able to associate with such an astral formation of the deity, it can =\r\nguide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also is trying to wor=\r\nk hard and sincerely to reach the causal planes (the real spiritual planes =\r\nof existence where the real force of the Deity originates). The difference,=\r\n if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and the real deity =\r\nis that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself of causing a com=\r\nplete and total transformation of the average human nature without a proact=\r\nive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane of the Great God=\r\ns, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid being transformed=\r\n in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformation will it be?=\r\n One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine humility, sens=\r\ne of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingly, a complete w=\r\nithdrawal of lower nature of man - lust, anger,\n&gt;  jealousy, greed, covetou=\r\nsness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, mental-illumination, genuine co=\r\nmpassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such an individual, even if he/s=\r\nhe just sits down next to another person, will exude a silent strong peace =\r\nand unselfish love which will automatically calm the minds and disturbed em=\r\notions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the=\r\n Divine Power of any of the great deities. This comes even if one deity is =\r\nproperly realized in the causal planes of existence. But the astral formati=\r\non of the same deity, which is created by the force of our own pranashakti =\r\nor Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not capable of affecting this kind=\r\n of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is n=\r\not limited because it can&#39;t=C2=A0 get me a better job or a nice pay hike or=\r\n cure some diseases or bring me fame or any such material benefit if I so a=\r\nsk of it - the astral formations of the deities\n&gt;  can very easily do all t=\r\nhese things in the physical world - but it is limited because it cannot by =\r\nitself give you the must authentic and persistent spirituality of the highe=\r\nr planes, the one aim and destination of all genuine sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since th=\r\nis astral plane is the way it is, therefore it&#39;s extremely important to kee=\r\np actively working on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, genuin=\r\ne internal surrender (when that happens one accepts all life-situations wit=\r\nhout the slightest grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc.=\r\n (all that is universally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless thes=\r\ne changes are affected at least to some degree in the mind and emotions of =\r\nthe sadhaka, one is simply not ready to reach the higher planes of God and =\r\nbenefit from them spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual evolut=\r\nion there is a gap between experience and realization. Only repeated experi=\r\nences *may* lead to realization. One off experiences create a force no doub=\r\nt, but in time it fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities=\r\n and conditioning of the sadhaka.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your \n&gt; theo=\r\nry. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain \n&gt; perso=\r\nn reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think whatever this guy is =\r\nuttering is=C2=A0complete truth, when in fact it is=C2=A0far from truth. \n&gt;=\r\n Once=C2=A0I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who spok=\r\ne \n&gt; Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I could not believe=\r\n \n&gt; what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went down the drain.&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You surety is incorrect. There were certain events which happened in=\r\n the last one and half years which made me sit down and rethink my own unde=\r\nrstanding of spirituality. At about the same time I started worshiping a sp=\r\necific personality of the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, t=\r\nhe more would thoughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spiritual=\r\nity is imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations t=\r\no find out what was wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed ret=\r\nhinking. First question I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality=\r\n? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and tr=\r\nuths. But it was still not exceptionally clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had first read Sri A=\r\nurobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyond the first two pages. =\r\nThey were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gav=\r\ne me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and rest I=\r\n rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arrogance. Ne=\r\nver opened any of his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana was goin=\r\ng on and as I was instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my understan=\r\nding, one day while meditating I had an inner thought in the form of an ima=\r\nge, which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very s=\r\npecific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly pr=\r\nessing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in the pre=\r\nscribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was strug=\r\ngling to understand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get =\r\na proper hang of, I was able to understand\n&gt;  from his writings with much d=\r\neeper clarity.=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more sense to me. Many=\r\n sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new light. I read 40 -=\r\n 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to stop at a certain po=\r\nint of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I will have to firs=\r\nt make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational mind will distort th=\r\ne information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firmly 3 years ago, now=\r\n came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun. \n&gt; \n&gt; The line th=\r\nat you mention, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Aurobindo on the=\r\n historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, there is an inci=\r\ndent which comes later on, after the great war and when Yudhisthira was rul=\r\ning the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repeat the words h=\r\ne had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more since he has =\r\nforgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed away (it was a sp=\r\necial time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; on=\r\nce again. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vive=\r\nkananda was one of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in=\r\n jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appear before him daily and inst=\r\nruct him on the various layers of the mind, which he was not aware of till =\r\nthen. Swami Vivekananda had already left his physical body by then. It was =\r\nin the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and right=\r\n hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, and their c=\r\nonnection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science confirmed =\r\nthe same. \n&gt; \n&gt; Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry,=\r\n to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (wh=\r\nich he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuo=\r\nusly by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice of Kri=\r\nshna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was hi=\r\ns Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. An=\r\nyway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of spirit=\r\nuality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will=\r\n also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, each with=\r\n their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individual=\r\nly try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotional make=\r\nup, and help us to progress on the path. \n&gt; \n&gt; Though I now have a very dee=\r\np respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his criti=\r\ncs and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood =\r\nthe depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a function =\r\nof their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genui=\r\nne understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be unders=\r\ntood accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; Disc=\r\nlaimer---- My thinking is \n&gt; very different due to Darshan and=C2=A0Grace o=\r\nf Divine Mother & Divine \n&gt; Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not ag=\r\nree or follow the \n&gt; leader.Thanks.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I at-least will never feel unhap=\r\npy if you disagree. There are \n&gt; many saints, many philosophies, many paths=\r\n, not everyone is bound to \n&gt; like every path.=C2=A0 Disagreement is perfec=\r\ntly ok. Because someone \n&gt; disagrees with me or those whom I agree with, do=\r\nes not mean I like him \n&gt; any less. I try to keep my=C2=A0 emotional side (=\r\nwhere respect, love, \n&gt; dislike, hatred, anger, passions exist) separate fr=\r\nom my thinking mind. \n&gt; It is very much possible, through practice, for a m=\r\nan to disassociate \n&gt; his rational-mind from the emotional-mind. So have no=\r\n fears that your \n&gt; disagreement is going to make me like you any less or a=\r\nny more.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with the emotional part of our being is that it j=\r\numps up at appearances, running ahead to grasp the truth rather than waitin=\r\ng patiently for the truth to arrive in all its aspects and dimensions, and =\r\nin the process it distorts the truth and then reacts to that distorted imag=\r\ne. For example, recently in some social forums I posted a comment that I fo=\r\nund the Tantrik Adwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Adwaith=\r\na, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-selling supporters. Im=\r\nmediately some friends of mine on Twitter and otherwise, jumped to the fals=\r\ne conclusion that I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and tried best to make =\r\nme &quot;see the truth&quot; by such grandiose statements that=C2=A0 Shankara is the =\r\n&#39;final word&#39; on Adwaitha and everything else must be necessarily lesser. Or=\r\n that I was making an egoistic denouncement. Both of which are million ligh=\r\nt-years away from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti\n&gt; =\r\n (manifestation) of God, that much I am certain. His compositions are so br=\r\nilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficiently appreciated in words. Yet, I have equ=\r\nally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy. And because I am not bound to a=\r\nccept his philosophy, does not mean I respect or love him any less than any=\r\n other great saint.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; If you disrespect a man, and specially a sai=\r\nnt, and then start disliking him too with a passion, you are creating stron=\r\ng negative karmas. But if you can disagree with someone without losing resp=\r\nect or love for the person, in an objective manner, you reap very little ka=\r\nrmic effects. That is why Lord Krishna too advices us to become more detach=\r\ned in life.\n&gt; \n&gt; In conclusion, Narasimha is totally correct. Many things c=\r\nannot be sufficiently expressed in words without causing some distortion.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manya=\r\nntE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihar=\r\ni@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: A thought\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai,\n&gt; How a=\r\nre you doing?

Rest all the range of experiences that come from this realm, and 95 =\r\npercent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and f=\r\nury without substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it =\r\nthe intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got s=\r\nwept away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross =\r\nthis realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang o=\r\nn tightly to the fundamentals.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awak=\r\ntam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyay=\r\namanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM\n&gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; A sage =\r\n&quot;sms&quot; indeed! Yes direction must be always, always the top most priority. I=\r\nt reminded me of simple, yet quite effective day to day example of driving =\r\nCar. One can not miss/ignore the sight of correct road to the destination e=\r\nven for a split second. However, Optimised &quot;controlled&quot; speed (even if very=\r\n fast by set standards) could be an added advantage while not loosing the s=\r\night of the road.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In mailto:vedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Got an s=\r\nms from a good friend today. Thought I will share it here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Progre=\r\nss has little to do with speed; but much to do with direction. So always co=\r\nncentrate on your direction, not on speed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For any genuine spirit=\r\nual seeker, this\n&gt;  is one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of sp=\r\nirituality, too many people get caught up in the less important - aka, visi=\r\nons, &#39;experiences&#39;, tough-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc e=\r\ntc, while forgetting the goal of real spirituality, that is transformation =\r\nof mind/emotions/body resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater=\r\n equanimity to life situations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility=\r\n, lessening of lower emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings=\r\n, furious attachments, such that eventually every action of the individual =\r\nis like a consecration (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transfo=\r\nrmed and so away from our average superficial existence, that it becomes a =\r\nfulfillment on its own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is=\r\n the progressive unfolding of a transformation process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complex ri=\r\ntuals and speedy sadhanas and experiences et al are ok, provided one does n=\r\not\n&gt;  lose sight of the fundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise o=\r\nne ends up running in circles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is no=\r\nt necessary a spiritual entity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-wa=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
