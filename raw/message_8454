The far away place is full of bliss and the per=\r\nson is submerged in it and would lose their identity.

It has not happened wit=\r\nh you that Divine Mother has called you and given HER MANTRA to you. It has=\r\n not yet happened that you are coming back from a Temple in India and you a=\r\nre weeping uncontrollably because you do not know when you will come back. =\r\nyou have not yet received your pass so you can enter in to Her Lila. I gues=\r\ns you will have to just wait for door to open. And once this happens you wi=\r\nll change many of your thought as sure as sun rises in the east.\nIt is true=\r\n someone can go in to that bliss state without having a Darshan of Divine B=\r\neings. It is also true that after reaching that bliss state one can have Da=\r\nrshan as well. I prefer and want to hold the Feet of Divine Mother.\n\nI have=\r\n tickled you so many times so you have to give me some suggestions now. Eve=\r\nryday I recite several prayers and mantras in a continuous stream for so ma=\r\nny hours.I dare not say how many.I also do similar thing for my mother who =\r\nis very old, sitting next to her and placing my hand her head. Last several=\r\n months my throat muscles have become very tired and painful. I know using =\r\nhoney and warm water sometimes help.

B=\r\nut in my mind, Durga, Lakshmi, Hari and Hara are all One, so I feel I worsh=\r\nip them all when I say the mantra Om NamoNarayanaya (for that matter, I fee=\r\nl I worship Allah, Buddha and Jehovah too when I repeat this mantra). I fee=\r\nl all these exist in Narayana. While I love the forms of Hari and Durga esp=\r\necially, and find them the easiest to talk to, I also find the forms of Rad=\r\nha and Shiva enchantingly beautiful. The Hare Krishnas say that Krishna can=\r\n only be attained through the Grace of Radha. Many saints have said in the =\r\npast that the mother is always easily accessible, always close to her child=\r\nren, keeping an eye on them and they can speak with her freely.....the fath=\r\ner tends to be a bit more distant....and only the Mother can introduce a ch=\r\nild to it&#39;s Father! This idea sort of appeals to my mind. So I pester/worsh=\r\nip Durga to attain both Hari and Her too\n (they are One of course). And als=\r\no, to attain the formless God that is beyond them both. I feel it is She wh=\r\no keeps me on the path, and keeps my sadhana going. Without her, there&#39;s no=\r\n doubt, that all would be lost. \n\nDubeyji,\n\nThanks for the links....I found=\r\n the articles very interesting. Not quite sure what to make of the one on s=\r\nleep paralysis, but all I can say is, I will certainly keep up the chanting=\r\n before bedtime! \n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0It was =\r\nnice to see =A0your letter and read about your experience.

And what you experienced w=\r\nas very frightening at such a young age but it will prove positive for you =\r\nin future. One day soon or later you will become a teacher yourself and giv=\r\ne Diksha to others and if somebody asks your help in such a situation you w=\r\nill draw on your experience and not on some bookish knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0I ha=\r\nve to say that I have experienced a great deal of such similar disturbing i=\r\nncident . Each and every time I have been saved by Grace of Divine mother. =\r\nI will woke up shouting and reciting Divine names. Sometimes I would know w=\r\nhat might be the cause of such a attack. I never dismiss such incidents as =\r\njust my imagination=A0and try to take proper action by going over the thing=\r\ns I have done previous day. I am also able to see very easily spirits/being=\r\ns etc and some years back I used to give deep healing to certain persons wh=\r\nom I had never met so they might go to higher dimensions and become free fr=\r\nom cycle. And I always ask Divine Mother&#39;s permission for it. Last year in =\r\nOct. ancestors of very famous family in England suddenly appeared in my fro=\r\nnt room where I was doing my everyday japa and indicated they need similar =\r\nsort of healing. They were a couple who were very famous when they were ali=\r\nve. I became very nervous and got up and avoided touching them\n&gt;=A0 and wen=\r\nt to my Puja Room to ask for guidance. Divine Mother immediately refused an=\r\ny healing for them through me. They have sort of disappeared since then.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I am puzzled by something you said.You will pester -Her- for help. Help =\r\nfor What?? They are Sister And Brother and in fact They are One and Same. T=\r\nhis world is creation of Divine Mother. She is in it and also far away from=\r\n it.And when She is meshed up with Her devotees She feels joy and pain as w=\r\nell. And if you will pray and worship Her for this reason She might not say=\r\n anything but some heart string will not play right. And Her Big Brother wi=\r\nll also look at Her. I would hold Her Feet for Her sake and do the likewise=\r\n for Divine Lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I was living in Brijbhoomi, it was the ashram o=\r\nf disciples of Swami Shivanand =A0where I have rented a room. When I came b=\r\nack to London I kept receiving pamphlets from the Sivanand Yoga centre for =\r\nseveral years. I never attended any workshop there but I used to cut out th=\r\ne pictures and names of Divine Mother and keep them in my books.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;=\r\n=A0 From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 28 June 2012, 19:09\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Maha=\r\nmrityunjaya and Divine Namapathy\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhanks for the encouraging message. The thought of Vishnu turning on his wat=\r\nery resting place and glancing in this direction is rather sweet. You&#39;ve mo=\r\ntivated me to do the mantra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I =\r\nwill pester Her for help with this......Ramakrishna says you have to keep t=\r\nugging at Her sari till she gives you something vaguely worthwhile like dev=\r\notion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very interesting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agree t=\r\nhat the Name provides protection against dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like to =\r\nthink about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed to say that have always =\r\nbeen scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOnce at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some exams. It =\r\nwas after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.=A0 I was moved to a ro=\r\nom that was different to the one I had been staying in, as my usual room wa=\r\ns being used for some conference guests. I used to hang out with the Hare K=\r\nrishnas then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama mahamantra then (s=\r\ntill love this mantra, but chant Om NamoNarayanaya more now)- used to do 2 =\r\nhours a day and it made me feel good. \n&gt; \n&gt; I was lying on my back in this =\r\nnew room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of light sleep =\r\nstate. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can only be describe=\r\nd as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I felt very fr=\r\nightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this state, m=\r\ny mind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari&quot; very very fast in te=\r\nrror. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could say it ver=\r\ny fast with concentration! The frightening experience then passed and I fel=\r\nt the Name saved me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I woke up and turned on the light feeling absolut=\r\nely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did something I wouldn=\r\n&#39;t normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London at that time of =\r\nnight (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve stayed there) an=\r\nd had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated me i=\r\nnto my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly came =\r\nto the phone and reassured me saying it could have been some real negative =\r\nforce or just something from my imagination. Either way, she reassured me s=\r\naying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating the Name was the =\r\nright approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar expe=\r\nriences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before going to bed a=\r\nnd slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I&#39;m a coward ;=\r\n).\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name before bed=\r\ntime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine e=\r\nnergy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrij=\r\nishrihari@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Hello,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =A0 Thanks for writi=\r\nng this mail and the=A0link to to the article.=A0.=A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; This is a=\r\n very powerful and sacred mantra and I am sure regular japa=A0brings peace =\r\nand protection.

It is weird to see how the body loses all importance the moment it dies.=\r\n It is also strange how a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactl=\r\ny like someone just left. It certainly makes one think that there must be s=\r\nomething more to us than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattract=\r\nive in old age, filled with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hide=\r\nous in death. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is interesting to think about what one can do to=\r\n help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It =\r\nis not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utterly helpless to reli=\r\neve suffering. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda used to have great faith in the Name- he=\r\n used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki=\r\n etc all have their place, he used to say that, Namapathy was an outstandin=\r\ng way to prevent disease and heal us on all levels- physical, mental and sp=\r\niritual. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While he said all names of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jeh=\r\novah- are equal, he often mentioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra specially fo=\r\nr healing purposes. And especially for those who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He says &quot;MahaMrityunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurable dis=\r\neases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; I visited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu=\r\n some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day w=\r\nith chanting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients,=\r\n each other and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the little A=\r\nshram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repe=\r\nating mantras with your colleagues. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention the power=\r\n of this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or =\r\nindeed, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke t=\r\nhe blessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Bas=\r\nically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course i=\r\nt is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of G=\r\nod). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At any point in time, there are several human beings, animal=\r\ns and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly =\r\nduring the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra=\r\n a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I be=\r\nlieve them. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is a link for those who are interested in learni=\r\nng more about this great mantra.

But in my mind, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-14&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Durg=\r\na&lt;/span&gt;, Lakshmi, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-15&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt; and=\r\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-16&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hara&lt;/span&gt; are all One, so I feel=\r\n I worship them all when I say the mantra Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-17&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-18&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narayanaya&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; (for that matter, I feel I worship Allah, Buddha and Jehovah too when =\r\nI repeat this mantra). I feel all these exist in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-19&quot; c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narayana&lt;/span&gt;. While I love the forms of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspe=\r\nll-20&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-21&quot; class=3D&quot;mar=\r\nk&quot;&gt;Durga&lt;/span&gt; especially, and find them the easiest to talk to, I also fi=\r\nnd the forms of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-22&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Radha&lt;/span&gt; and Sh=\r\niva enchantingly beautiful. The Hare &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-23&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;Krishnas&lt;/span&gt; say that Krishna can only be attained through the Grace o=\r\nf &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-24&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Radha&lt;/span&gt;. Many saints have sa=\r\nid in the past that the mother is always easily accessible, always close to=\r\n\n her children, keeping an eye on them and they can speak with her freely..=\r\n...the father tends to be a bit more distant....and only the Mother can int=\r\nroduce a child to it&#39;s Father! This idea sort of appeals to my mind. So I p=\r\nester/worship &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-25&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Durga&lt;/span&gt; to attai=\r\nn both &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-26&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt; and Her too (the=\r\ny are One of course). And also, to attain the formless God that is beyond t=\r\nhem both. I feel it is She who keeps me on the path, and keeps my &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-27&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhana&lt;/span&gt; going. Without her, there&#39;s =\r\nno doubt, that all would be lost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-28&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Dubeyji&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the links....I found the articles =\r\nvery interesting. Not quite sure what to make of the one on sleep paralysis=\r\n, but all I can say is, I will certainly keep up the chanting before bedtim=\r\ne! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-29&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Apa=\r\nrna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; Hi,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was nice to see &nbsp;your letter and =\r\nread about your experience. There is no need to feel embarrassment as a gre=\r\nat deal of people feel unhappy talking about ghost/spirit although they mig=\r\nht say otherwise. And what you experienced was very frightening at such a y=\r\noung age but it will prove positive for you in future. One day soon or late=\r\nr you will become a teacher yourself and give &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-32&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Diksha&lt;/span&gt; to others and if somebody asks your help in such a=\r\n situation you will draw on your experience and not on some bookish knowled=\r\nge.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;I have to say that I have experienced a great de=\r\nal of such similar disturbing incident . Each and every\n time I have been s=\r\naved by Grace of Divine mother. I will woke up shouting and reciting Divine=\r\n names. Sometimes I would know what might be the cause of such a attack. I =\r\nnever dismiss such incidents as just my imagination&nbsp;and try to take pr=\r\noper action by going over the things I have done previous day. I am also ab=\r\nle to see very easily spirits/beings etc and some years back I used to give=\r\n deep healing to certain persons whom I had never met so they might go to h=\r\nigher dimensions and become free from cycle. And I always ask Divine Mother=\r\n&#39;s permission for it. Last year in Oct. ancestors of very famous family in =\r\nEngland suddenly appeared in my front room where I was doing my everyday &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;misspell-33&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japa&lt;/span&gt; and indicated they need s=\r\nimilar sort of healing. They were a couple who were very famous when they w=\r\nere alive. I became very nervous and got up and avoided touching them&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp; and went to my &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-34&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Puja&lt;/span=\r\n&gt; Room to ask for guidance. Divine Mother immediately refused any healing f=\r\nor them through me. They have sort of disappeared since then.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; I am puzzled by something you said.You will pester -Her- for help. Help=\r\n for What?? They are Sister And Brother and in fact They are One and Same. =\r\nThis world is creation of Divine Mother. She is in it and also far away fro=\r\nm it.And when She is meshed up with Her devotees She feels joy and pain as =\r\nwell. And if you will pray and worship Her for this reason She might not sa=\r\ny anything but some heart string will not play right. And Her Big Brother w=\r\nill also look at Her. I would hold Her Feet for Her sake and do the likewis=\r\ne for Divine Lord.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; When I was living in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspe=\r\nll-35&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Brijbhoomi&lt;/span&gt;, it was the ashram of disciples of =\r\nSwami &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-36&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Shivanand&lt;/span&gt; &nbsp;where =\r\nI have rented a room. When I came back to London I\n kept receiving pamphlet=\r\ns from the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-37&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sivanand&lt;/span&gt; Yoga cen=\r\ntre for several years. I never attended any workshop there but I used to cu=\r\nt out the pictures and names of Divine Mother and keep them in my books.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-38&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Laxmi=\r\nNarayan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; From: sunrise_108=\r\n0 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: &lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, 28 June 2012, 19:09&lt;br&gt;&gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Re: &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-40&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityun=\r\njaya&lt;/span&gt; and Divine &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-41&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namapathy&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Hello &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-42=\r\n&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;LaxmiNarayanji&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks for\n the en=\r\ncouraging message.

Thank you. :) I will pester Her =\r\nfor help with this......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sa=\r\nri till she gives you something vaguely worthwhile like devotion.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Very interesting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agree that =\r\nthe Name provides protection against dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like to thin=\r\nk about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed to say that have always been=\r\n scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some ex=\r\nams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.&nbsp; I was mo=\r\nved to a room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as my us=\r\nual room was being used for some conference guests. I used to\n hang out wit=\r\nh the Hare &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-43&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Krishnas&lt;/span&gt; then, an=\r\nd was really into chanting the Hare Rama &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-44&quot; class=3D&quot;=\r\nmark&quot;&gt;mahamantra&lt;/span&gt; then (still love this mantra, but chant Om &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-45&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;NamoNarayanaya&lt;/span&gt; more now)- used to do=\r\n 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I was lying on m=\r\ny back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort =\r\nof light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can o=\r\nnly be described as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me!=\r\n I felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In this state, my mind started repeating &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-4=\r\n6&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-47&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-48&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span id=3D&quot;mi=\r\nsspell-49&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-50&quot;\n class=3D&quot;m=\r\nark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;&quot; very very fast in terror. I think I chose this name becau=\r\nse it was short and I could say it very fast with concentration! The fright=\r\nening experience then passed and I felt the Name saved me.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n I woke up and turned on the light feeling absolutely petrified and unable =\r\nto go back to sleep. I then did something I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang th=\r\ne &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-51&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; Yoga centre in L=\r\nondon at that time of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as=\r\n I&#39;ve stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Sw=\r\nami who initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm,=\r\n she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have be=\r\nen some real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either w=\r\nay, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repea=\r\nting the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting\n before bedtim=\r\ne to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-52&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamantra&lt;/span&gt; before going to bed and s=\r\nlept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I&#39;m a coward ;).&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Since then, I keep up the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-53&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;practice&lt;/span&gt; of repeating the Name before bedtime. I feel it keep=\r\ns the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine energy to my mind ens=\r\nuring better sleep. :)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;span=\r\n id=3D&quot;misspell-54&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp; Thanks for writing this mail and the&nbsp;link to to the article.&nbsp=\r\n;.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; This is a very powerful and sacre=\r\nd mantra and I am sure regular &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-58&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japa=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;brings peace and protection. Some years back I went to Delhi f=\r\nor few days and stayed at my friend&#39;s house which was on fifth floor. The b=\r\nuilding was new and he told me after he moved in with his family they had d=\r\none big haven of this mantra.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; During night before I went to sl=\r\neep I was trying to do&nbsp;a eye open meditation and was in a slight tranc=\r\ne.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/entities were trying to come in the room =\r\nthrough window but they could not come as there was a covering of white lig=\r\nht there. I knew immediately it is the effect of that haven in the house. N=\r\now in the link article same thing\n is mentioned as a psychic shield. Probab=\r\nly&nbsp;this shield &nbsp;was all round the&nbsp;.building but more&nbsp;so=\r\n on fifth floor.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; In your previous mail you=\r\n have said how you are doing mantra &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-59&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;=\r\n&gt;japa&lt;/span&gt; to complete the required number. You are doing such a intense =\r\nworkout with your everyday normal life and it is making Divine Lord take a =\r\nturn on His &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-60&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Waterbed&lt;/span&gt; in Milk=\r\n Ocean and take a look towards earth plane. Did you know this?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n And what will happen when you are holding phone and pretending and it actu=\r\nally rings. Your workmate will know your secret.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-61&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;LaxmiNa=\r\nrayan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; _______=\r\n_________________________&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; h=\r\nref=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, 25 June 2012, 19:37&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-63&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt; =\r\nand Divine &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-64&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namapathy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Greetings,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Hope you&#39;re all w=\r\nell, and that your &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-65&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhanas&lt;/span&gt; =\r\nare going fantastically well (especially after we all told each other to ge=\r\nt &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-66&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;verrrry&lt;/span&gt; serious). &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had a gruelling few shifts in hospital the last fe=\r\nw days, including witnessing some unfortunately inevitable deaths in very s=\r\nick people...something that has become part of my daily life as a doctor. I=\r\nt is weird to see how the body loses all importance the moment it dies. It =\r\nis also strange how a dead body looks\n just like an empty house...exactly l=\r\nike someone just left. It certainly makes one think that there must be some=\r\nthing more to us than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive=\r\n in old age, filled with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous=\r\n in death. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is interesting to think about wha=\r\nt one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyond all=\r\n human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utterly h=\r\nelpless to relieve suffering. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;missp=\r\nell-67&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; used to have great faith in the Nam=\r\ne- he used to call it &quot;Divine &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-68&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namap=\r\nathy&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. While modern medicine, Ayurveda, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-69&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Reiki&lt;/span&gt; etc all have their place, he used to say that, &lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-70&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namapathy&lt;/span&gt; was an outstanding wa=\r\ny to prevent disease and heal us on all levels-\n physical, mental and spiri=\r\ntual. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; While he said all names of God- Rama, All=\r\nah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell=\r\n-71&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt; mantra specially for healing pur=\r\nposes. And especially for those who are very sick or dying.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; He says &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-72&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;MahaMrityunjay=\r\na&lt;/span&gt; Mantra will remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long l=\r\nife and immortality. It is a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-73&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Moksha=\r\n&lt;/span&gt; Mantra too.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I visited the &lt;span id=3D&quot;m=\r\nisspell-74&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; Charitable hospital in &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-75&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Pattamadai&lt;/span&gt;, Tamil &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspe=\r\nll-76&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Nadu&lt;/span&gt; some years ago, and the doctors and nurse=\r\ns who work there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including the &lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-77&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt;) for\n their pat=\r\nients, each other and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the li=\r\nttle Ashram hospital in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-78&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Rishikesh&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with you=\r\nr colleagues. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention the power of =\r\nthis mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or inde=\r\ned, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the b=\r\nlessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basical=\r\nly saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course it is=\r\n NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God).=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; At any point in time, there are several human =\r\nbeings, animals and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suff=\r\nering greatly during the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repe=\r\nat this mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our\n sages say it =\r\nworks, and I believe them. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Here is a link for t=\r\nhose who are interested in learning more about this great mantra. The artic=\r\nle is written by a disciple of Swami &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-79&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;Satyananda&lt;/span&gt;, a saint of very recent times. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-80&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &n=\r\nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; || Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-81&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;ShaantihShaantihShaantih&lt;/span&gt; ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
