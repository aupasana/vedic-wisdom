People here know better than that=\r\n.\n \nI never talked of superficial things such as &quot;complexion&quot;. Moreover, yo=\r\nu are replacing Kaalika with crows in your sircasm and making fun really of=\r\n Tantra and Parasara.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Here&#39;s another list for you=\r\n from Todala Tantra:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;see below for list&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the Mahavidya=\r\n (left) and their spouses (right side). See that \n&gt; Mahatripurasundari&#39;s sp=\r\nouse is Somanatha, and surely the name Soma-Natha \n&gt; implies that he is the=\r\n Jyotirlinga associated with the Moon. But in your \n&gt; list Moon is Kali, so=\r\n where are we at now with the logic you used and \n&gt; the list you have deriv=\r\ned?\n \nInstead of getting caught in superficial and extraneous factors, let =\r\nus go to the crux.\n \nMahavidyas and their consorts are not showing the same=\r\n thing, but two different things that have a synergy. The list of planets m=\r\napping to mahavidyas and those mapping to mahavidya consorts will according=\r\nly have to be different. I will elaborate with examples.\n \nEach mahavidya r=\r\nepresents one form of liberating supreme knowledge that helps one overcome =\r\nduality and become liberated, starting from different vantage points within=\r\n duality and approaching liberation from them. Consorts are the factors tha=\r\nt aid in that approach.\n \n*        *        *\n \nFor example, Kaali is equat=\r\ned to Krishna by Munda Maalaa Tantra and Krishna is equated to Moon by Para=\r\nsara. So Kaali is shown by Moon. From the perspective of Moon (mind), this =\r\nduality is a very troublesome temptation and the way to overcome it is to r=\r\nealize its impermanence and destroy the duality so that it cannot tempt aga=\r\nin.\n \nDuring this process, the ideal companion of Moon is Saturn (vairagya =\r\nand discipline). So the consort of Kaali shown by Moon is Mahakala shown by=\r\n Saturn.\n \nTake Taaraa. She is equated to Raama by Munda Maalaa Tantra and =\r\nRaama is equated to Sun by Parasara. So Taaraa is shown by Sun. From the pe=\r\nrspective of Sun (soul), this duality is an ocean of delusion that needs to=\r\n be waded across to reach the supreme cosmic soul.\n \nDuring this process, t=\r\nhe ideal companion of Sun is Jupiter (intelligence and discrimination). Jus=\r\nt as rajaguru (Jupiter) guides king (Sun), the intellect and discrimination=\r\n will aid soul in the process of wading the ocean of duality and reaching t=\r\nhe supreme. So the consort of Taaraa shown by Sun is Akshobhya shown by Jup=\r\niter.\n \nTake Chhinnamasta. She is equated to Bhaargava Raama by Munda Maala=\r\na Tantra and Bhaargava Raama is equated to Venus by Parasara. So Chhinnamas=\r\nta is shown by Venus. From the perspective of Venus (enjoyment), this duali=\r\nty needs to be enjoyed and not run away from. The symbolism behind Chhinnam=\r\nasta depicted accompanied by a naked couple in copulation and associates dr=\r\ninking wine is that nothing is impure and all is Brahman. That is the take =\r\nof Venus (enjoyment).\n \nDuring this process, the ideal companion of Venus (=\r\nenjoyment) is Ketu (detachment and egolessness). Only when the enjoyment is=\r\n gone through without ego and identification can it be conducive to liberat=\r\nion. So the consort of Chhinnamasta shown by Venus is Shiva-Kabandha shown =\r\nby Ketu. Kabandha means the headless one.\n \nAs Dhumaavati is shown by Jupit=\r\ner (dhee, i.e. intellect and discrimination), there is no need for a compan=\r\nion. If the force of dhee is there, one realizes that all is god and does n=\r\not distinguish between good and bad, happy and sad etc and becomes liberate=\r\nd easily. One with a strong aatmabala or manobala can waver and may need su=\r\npplementing influences, but one with a strong dheeshakti is fine. There is =\r\nno supplementing influence.\n \n*        *        *\n\nNow let us take your exa=\r\nmple. Mahatripuarasundari is equated to Kalki by Munda Mala Tantra and Kalk=\r\ni is equated to lagna by Maharshi Parasara. So Tripura is lagna.\n\nWhile Sun=\r\n and Moon show the soul and mind, lagna shows the individualized consciousn=\r\ness through which we operate in the world. It includes body and more. It is=\r\n lagna through which we act in the world. From the point of view of lagna, =\r\nduality is to be overcome by doing what is expected from us by Nature and e=\r\nngaging in actions. Tripura personifies the supreme liberating knowledge of=\r\n using the individualized consciousness to engage in perfect actions in the=\r\n world to liberate oneself.\n\nNow, the most useful companion of lagna in thi=\r\ns process is Moon (mind). The actor within you (lagna) needs mind as mind t=\r\nells the actor what to do. Thus, the ideal companion of lagna is Moon. Acco=\r\nrdingly, the consort of Mahatripurasundari shown by lagna is Somanatha show=\r\nn by Moon.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYou can find similar logic for all of th=\r\nem. Here is the full list:\n \n1. Kaali (Moon) - Mahaa Kaala (Saturn)\n2. Taar=\r\naa (Sun) - Akshobhya (Jupiter)\n3. Mahatripurisundari (Lagna) - Somanaatha (=\r\nMoon)\n4. Bhuvaneswari (Rahu) - Tryambaka (Venus)\n5. Bhairavi (Mars) - Daksh=\r\ninaamurti (Sun)\n6. Chhinamastaa (Venus) - Shiva-Kabandha (Ketu)\n7. Dhumavat=\r\ni (Jupiter) - None\n8. Bagalaamukhi (Saturn) - Mahaa Rudra (Mars)\n9. Maatang=\r\ni (Mercury) - Shiva Maatanga (Rahu)\n10. Kamalatmika (Ketu) - Vishnurupi Sad=\r\naashiva (Mercury)\n \nShort notes on the ones I did not cover before:\n \nBhair=\r\navi represents the path of Mars, i.e. viewing the duality as a challenge th=\r\nat needs to be fought hard and fearlessly and not fear anything, including =\r\ndeath and pain. The ideal companion is aatmabala, represented by Sun, just =\r\nas a good king (Sun) is an ideal supplement for a good commander (Mars).\n \n=\r\nBagalaamukhi represents the path of Saturn, i.e. viewing the duality as tha=\r\nt which results from one&#39;s own weaknesses, sins and internal enemies and se=\r\neing a conquest of internal enemies as the key to overcoming duality. The f=\r\nighting spirit represented by Mars is the ideal companion in the process of=\r\n overcoming enemies. Mahaa Rudra shown by Mars is hence the consort of Baga=\r\nlamukhi.\n \nMaatangi represents the path of Mercury, i.e. viewing the dualit=\r\ny as that which needs to be learnt, understood, mastered and then overcome.=\r\n Free thinking without boundaries, represented by Rahu, is the ideal compan=\r\nion in this path. Maatanga means free spirited one or free roamer and Shiva=\r\n Maatanga is such a form of Shiva. He is the consort of Maatangi.\n \n*      =\r\n  *        *\n \nFriends, there may be an outcry to my writings from astrolog=\r\ners used to a different planet-mahavidya map (which is NOT sanctioned by an=\r\ny scripture and yet popular today in some circles). I may not be able to re=\r\nspond to all the mails.\n \nBut please do bear in mind that there is a simple=\r\n and uniform philosophy behind the concept of Mahavidyas. Flowery expositio=\r\nns without a uniform philosophy and even a basic uniform understanding of w=\r\nhat Mahavidyas are for are useless. If you are told logic like &quot;Tripurasund=\r\nari holds sugarcane. Mercury shows sugar cane. So Tripurasundari is shown b=\r\ny Mercury&quot;, reject such superficial logic. If somebody tells you that a mah=\r\navidya is for winning lawsuits or for getting power or getting wealth, reje=\r\nct such things.\n \nPlease remember that mahavidyas are forms of *supreme lib=\r\nerating knowledge*. The path to liberation looks different from the point o=\r\nf view of different planets.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFr=\r\nee Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------ \n \n--- In sohamsa@...=\r\nm, Visti Larsen &lt;visti@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; ??? ??? ?????\n&gt; Dear Narasimha, Nama=\r\nskar.\n&gt; Great... so because crows are black, as is Krishna&#39;s complexion, so=\r\n \n&gt; Crows and Krishna are both Moon.

For example, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;kR^iShnastu kaalikaa saa=\r\nkShaat raamamUrtishca taariNI&quot; literally \n&gt; &gt; means &quot;Krishna is literally K=\r\naalika and Rama is Taarini&quot;.

Narasimha&#39;s list is his own invention=\r\n... the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sloka mentions nothing about the graha linkages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nJust because Parasara equates Sun to Rama we should think Sun should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nalso be Tarini as per the Mahavidya-Vishnu avatara link? This is not a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; proper logic, in fact when we were taught the Agni Purana on the second\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; year of Jaimini Sutras, and the names of Vishnu therein, we saw a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; completely different concept of mapping of the grahas to the name of \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; avataras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This mapping that Narasimha has suggested is sim=\r\nply not acceptable \n&gt; &gt; as it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is too simple an explanation, and doesn=\r\n&#39;t bring out the real importance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as to how the Mahavidya and Vishnu A=\r\nvatara are connected.

Out of all planet-mahavidya\n&gt; mappings I=\r\n have seen, this is the most philosophically sound mapping.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun - Taar=\r\naa - Raama\n&gt; Moon - Kaali - Krishna\n&gt; Mars - Bhairavi - Nrisimha\n&gt; Mercury =\r\n- Maatangi - Buddha\n&gt; Jupiter - Dhumaavati - Vaamana\n&gt; Venus - Chhinnamasta=\r\na - Bhaargava Rama\n&gt; Saturn - Bagalamukhi - Koorma\n&gt; Rahu - Bhuvaneswari - =\r\nVaraaha\n&gt; Ketu - Kamala - Matsya\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Vidya is kno=\r\nwledge. Mahavidya is supreme knowledge. Dasa mahavidyas are the\n&gt; ten highe=\r\nst forms of knowledge that take us to moksha or liberation,\n&gt; approaching f=\r\nrom different angles. Other kinds of knowledge (e.g.\n&gt; mathematics, physics=\r\n, astronomy, astrology, grammar etc) do not liberate us.\n&gt; But these ten ki=\r\nnds of knowledge liberate us. The deities (names and forms\n&gt; described in b=\r\nooks for ten mahavidyas) are personifications of those ten\n&gt; types of supre=\r\nme knowledge that liberate us.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note on=\r\ne thing here. Moksha means overcoming the maayaa of the\n&gt; duality around us=\r\n. Seeing some things as desirable, some as undesirable,\n&gt; some as pleasurab=\r\nle, some as painful, some as beautiful, some as ugly etc is\n&gt; what binds us=\r\n. Overcoming the duality and seeing all as Brahman is\n&gt; liberation or moksh=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; Different planets represent different aspects of our selves. The du=\r\nality\n&gt; around us and the way to overcome it seem different from different =\r\nangles.\n&gt; From the point of view of individual soul (Sun), this maayaa is s=\r\nomething\n&gt; that needs to be overcome by crossing and reaching the other end=\r\n (supreme\n&gt; cosmic soul). From the point of view of mind (Moon), this duali=\r\nty is\n&gt; something that clouds the vision and needs to be destroyed so that =\r\nit cannot\n&gt; tempt again. From the point of view of the intellect/discrimina=\r\ntion/dhee\n&gt; (Jupiter), it issomething that is non-existent anyway (&quot;so what=\r\n was the\n&gt; problem in the first place?&quot;), like shapes made of smoke. From t=\r\nhe point of\n&gt; view of initiative and energy within us (Mars), it is somethi=\r\nng that needs\n&gt; to be fought hard and fearlessly. From the point of view of=\r\n the learning\n&gt; ability within us (Mercury), it is something that needs to =\r\nbe learnt and\n&gt; understood fully so that we can overcome it. From the point=\r\n of view of\n&gt; enjoyment and happiness (Venus), it is something that needs t=\r\no be accepted\n&gt; and enjoyed and not something to fear or avoid (&quot;after all,=\r\n all is Brahman.\n&gt; Then why stay away from enjoyments?&quot;). And so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\nut remember one important thing. Whichever approach is taken to overcoming\n=\r\n&gt; duality, the end result is the same. One first masters the approach. It\n&gt;=\r\n becomes part of one&#39;s common sense and thinking. One eventually overcomes\n=\r\n&gt; duality. One becomes self-realized and becomes liberated. That end result=\r\n is\n&gt; the same irrespective of the approach chosen.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sun is the soul within us. The highest form of knowledge coming fro=\r\nm delving\n&gt; deep into this aspect is what makes one wade (tar=3Dswim/wade/c=\r\nross) the ocean\n&gt; of delusion and get to the source. If you master the know=\r\nledge that helps\n&gt; one view the world as an ocean that needs to be crossed =\r\nto reach the\n&gt; supreme, other things will follow and you eventually get lib=\r\neration. Taaraa\n&gt; personifies this knowledge.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Moon is the mind within=\r\n us. The highest form of knowledge coming from\n&gt; delving deep into this asp=\r\nect is an understanding of attachments and\n&gt; desires, their impermanence an=\r\nd how to kill them. If you master the\n&gt; knowledge that kills all attachment=\r\ns and desires and gives perfect control\n&gt; on the mind, other things will fo=\r\nllow and you eventually get liberation.\n&gt; Kaali personifies this knowledge.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mars is the energy and initiative within us. The highest form of kno=\r\nwledge\n&gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives one fearle=\r\nssness of\n&gt; anything in the universe. If you master the knowledge that make=\r\ns you utterly\n&gt; fearless and you do not fear anything (including death or p=\r\nain!) other\n&gt; things will follow and you eventually get liberation. Bhairav=\r\ni personifies\n&gt; this knowledge.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mercury is knowledge and learning abi=\r\nlity within us. The highest form of\n&gt; knowledge coming from delving deep in=\r\nto this aspect is what gives one\n&gt; learning of various topics. If you maste=\r\nr the knowledge that give you\n&gt; mastery of all kinds of learning through lo=\r\ngical and rational thinking,\n&gt; other things will follow and you eventually =\r\nget liberation. Maatangi\n&gt; personifies this knowledge. In fact, some people=\r\n associate Maatangi with\n&gt; Saraswati. Saraswati is also known as &quot;Maatanga =\r\nKanya&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jupiter is the intellect, wisdom and discrimination (dhee shak=\r\nti) within us.\n&gt; The highest form of knowledge coming from delving deep int=\r\no this aspect is\n&gt; that all is delusion. The individual soul and individual=\r\n mind and everything\n&gt; they perceive is just an illusion. All that is there=\r\n is Brahman. Any other\n&gt; perceptions, of various good or bad things, are ju=\r\nst a delusion, like\n&gt; figures made of smoke. If you master the knowledge th=\r\nat makes your intellect\n&gt; shine, you will realize that the entire world is =\r\na delusion and not deluded\n&gt; by anything anymore. Then other things will fo=\r\nllow and you eventually get\n&gt; liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this knowl=\r\nedge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Venus is the spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of =\r\nknowledge\n&gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes one ego=\r\nless and\n&gt; blissful. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fea=\r\nrless and\n&gt; you do not fear anything, including death or pain, other things=\r\n will follow\n&gt; and you eventually get liberation. Chhinnamasta personifies =\r\nthis knowledge.\n&gt; She is depicted as a deity holding her own severed head, =\r\nstanding near a\n&gt; naked couple in copulation and surrounded by associates w=\r\nho are drinking\n&gt; wine. One mastering this knowledge need not stay away fro=\r\nm any pleasures,\n&gt; but one learns to see god even those pleasures. However,=\r\n pleasure obtained\n&gt; with an ego (&quot;*I* am enjoying this act or object&quot;) bin=\r\nds. The headless state\n&gt; symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome I-ness=\r\n, pleasures are not\n&gt; binding. One not thinking in terms of &quot;*I* am enjoyin=\r\ng&quot; but having no sense\n&gt; of &quot;I&quot; can live life without running away from any=\r\n pleasures or undertaking\n&gt; any austerities and yet become liberated.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSaturn is the spirit of hard work within us. He also represents our\n&gt; weakn=\r\nesses and sins. The highest form of knowledge coming from delving deep\n&gt; in=\r\nto this aspect is what makes us realize our internal enemies and destroy\n&gt; =\r\nthem. If you master the knowledge that makes you overcome weaknesses such a=\r\ns\n&gt; laziness and internal enemies such as lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc, =\r\nother\n&gt; things will follow and you eventually get liberation. Bagalamukhi\n&gt;=\r\n personifies this knowledge. Most of her mantras ask to destroy enemies and=\r\n\n&gt; so people foolishly think that she is the one who gives success in\n&gt; lit=\r\nigation and worship her for court cases. This is like going to a king to\n&gt; =\r\nask for two spoons of sugar for your milk. You go to the king for bigger\n&gt; =\r\nthings and a neighbor is enough for giving you two spoons of sugar. The\n&gt; e=\r\nnemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are internal enemies and your own laziness.=\r\n\n&gt; Remember, she is a mahavidya, i.e. a type of supreme knowledge that\n&gt; li=\r\nberates you!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rahu is the spirit of material well-being within us. Rah=\r\nu is the one who\n&gt; binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn showing sins and=\r\n Rahu showing\n&gt; rebirth are important in the death chart). The highest form=\r\n of knowledge\n&gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives us =\r\nworldly success\n&gt; in a dhaarmik way. If you master the knowledge that makes=\r\n you materially\n&gt; successful in a dharmik way, you become successful and fu=\r\nlfil all your\n&gt; duties and debts in the world and eventually get liberation=\r\n. Bhuvaneswari\n&gt; personifies this knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ketu is the spirit of of =\r\ndetachment and Vedic knowledge within us. The\n&gt; highest form of knowledge c=\r\noming from delving deep into this aspect is the\n&gt; essense of Veda. If you m=\r\naster the knowledge that enables you to be in\n&gt; oneness with the supreme co=\r\nsmic being, you eventually get liberation. Kamala\n&gt; (Mahaalakshmi) personif=\r\nies this knowledge. According to saptashati rahasya\n&gt; also, Mahaalakshmi is=\r\n the Aadyaa (the first One). She is the energy of\n&gt; supreme cosmic being. S=\r\nhe divides Herself into 3 parts - Mahaakaali,\n&gt; Mahaalakshmi and MahaaSaras=\r\nwati and they create Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and\n&gt; their consorts. Kamala rep=\r\nresents the knowledge of the supreme cosmic energy\n&gt; of the supreme cosmic =\r\nbeing.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the above is not superior to th=\r\ne other. Depending on your vasanas\n&gt; (mental conditioning), attitudes, like=\r\ns and dislikes, depending on which\n&gt; aspect of your personality dominates o=\r\nver other aspects (the sinfulness and\n&gt; weaknesses? or the interest in lear=\r\nning things? or the spirit of fighting?\n&gt; or the sense of enjoyment? etc), =\r\none Mahavidya may be more suitable than\n&gt; others, as that knowledge uses yo=\r\nur strong aspect and moulds that aspect to\n&gt; take you towards liberation. D=\r\no not compare them. Take the one that is most\n&gt; suitable, but do master tha=\r\nt aspect.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some who do Dasa Mahavidy=\r\na sadhana by doing one Mahavidya&#39;s mantra\n&gt; for one month, then switch to a=\r\nnother and so on. They think that by doing\n&gt; each mahavidya mantra for a ce=\r\nrtain count, they &quot;finish&quot; the mahavidya\n&gt; sadhana. This is wrong and serve=\r\ns no useful purpose. Instead, one should\n&gt; pick any ONE mahavidya and succe=\r\ned in that sadhana. The definition of\n&gt; success is that the knowledge repre=\r\nsented by that deity becomes part of your\n&gt; common sense - you understand t=\r\nhat knowledge and ooze that knowledge in your\n&gt; thoughts and actions. Wheth=\r\ner you experience the deity as an external\n&gt; human-like form (who may impar=\r\nt some knowledge to you) or as an internal\n&gt; human-like form or as light or=\r\n as sound is secondary, but the end result\n&gt; should be that the knowledge r=\r\nepresented by Her should become common sense\n&gt; and second nature to you. On=\r\ne claiming visions or siddhi of a mahavidya but\n&gt; not showing the correspon=\r\nding knowledge is bluffing.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many people who do mahavidya sad=\r\nhana and yet many others who claim\n&gt; to have siddhi in one or more mahavidy=\r\nas, but very few who actually possess\n&gt; any of the ten mahavidyas. The area=\r\n of mahavidya sadhana is one of the most\n&gt; ill-understood in today&#39;s age of=\r\n ignorance and half-baked knowledge. It is\n&gt; easier to possess lower vidyas=\r\n or lower shaktis, but mahavidyas are beyond\n&gt; the capability of understand=\r\ning for most people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_028E_01C9E897.C16AD6C0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3527&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; Great... so because crows are black, as is \n=\r\nKrishna&#39;s complexion, so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Crows and Krishna are both Moon.

So the consort of Ta=\r\naraa \nshown by Sun is Akshobhya shown by Jupiter.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Take Chhinnamasta.

From the perspective of Venus \n(=\r\nenjoyment), this duality needs to be enjoyed and not run away from. The \nsy=\r\nmbolism behind Chhinnamasta depicted accompanied by a naked couple in \ncopu=\r\nlation and associates drinking wine is that nothing is impure and all is \nB=\r\nrahman.

From the \npoint of view of lagna, duality is to be overc=\r\nome by doing what is expected from \nus by Nature and engaging in actions. T=\r\nripura personifies the supreme liberating \nknowledge of using the individua=\r\nlized consciousness to engage in perfect actions \nin the world to liberate =\r\noneself.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Now, the most useful companion of lagna in=\r\n this \nprocess is Moon (mind). The actor within you (lagna) needs mind as m=\r\nind tells \nthe actor what to do. Thus, the ideal companion of lagna is Moon=\r\n. Accordingly, \nthe consort of Mahatripurasundari shown by lagna is Somanat=\r\nha shown by \nMoon.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;You can f=\r\nind similar logic for all of them.

Mahavidya is supreme knowledge.=\r\n Dasa mahavidyas are the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ten \nhighest forms of knowledge that take =\r\nus to moksha or liberation,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \napproaching from different angles. Oth=\r\ner kinds of knowledge (e.g.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nmathematics, physics, astronomy, astro=\r\nlogy, grammar etc) do not liberate \nus.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But these ten kinds of know=\r\nledge liberate us. The deities (names and \nforms&lt;BR&gt;&gt; described in books=\r\n for ten mahavidyas) are personifications of \nthose ten&lt;BR&gt;&gt; types of su=\r\npreme knowledge that liberate us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Please note one \nthing here. Moksha means overcoming the maayaa o=\r\nf the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; duality around us. \nSeeing some things as desirable, some as =\r\nundesirable,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some as \npleasurable, some as painful, some as beautif=\r\nul, some as ugly etc is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nwhat binds us. Overcoming the duality and =\r\nseeing all as Brahman is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nliberation or moksha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Di=\r\nfferent planets represent different \naspects of our selves. The duality&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; around us and the way to overcome it \nseem different from different an=\r\ngles.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From the point of view of \nindividual soul (Sun), this maayaa=\r\n is something&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that needs to be \novercome by crossing and reaching t=\r\nhe other end (supreme&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cosmic soul). \nFrom the point of view of mind=\r\n (Moon), this duality is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; something that \nclouds the vision and need=\r\ns to be destroyed so that it cannot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tempt \nagain. From the point of=\r\n view of the intellect/discrimination/dhee&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n(Jupiter), it issomethi=\r\nng that is non-existent anyway (&quot;so what was the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nproblem in the fi=\r\nrst place?&quot;), like shapes made of smoke. From the point \nof&lt;BR&gt;&gt; view of=\r\n initiative and energy within us (Mars), it is something that \nneeds&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; to be fought hard and fearlessly. From the point of view of the \nlearning=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ability within us (Mercury), it is something that needs to be \nlea=\r\nrnt and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; understood fully so that we can overcome it. From the point=\r\n \nof view of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enjoyment and happiness (Venus), it is something that =\r\nneeds \nto be accepted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and enjoyed and not something to fear or avoi=\r\nd (&quot;after \nall, all is Brahman.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then why stay away from enjoyments?=\r\n&quot;). And so \non.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But remember one important thing. Whicheve=\r\nr approach is \ntaken to overcoming&lt;BR&gt;&gt; duality, the end result is the s=\r\name. One first \nmasters the approach. It&lt;BR&gt;&gt; becomes part of one&#39;s comm=\r\non sense and \nthinking. One eventually overcomes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; duality. One becom=\r\nes self-realized \nand becomes liberated. That end result is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the sam=\r\ne irrespective of the \napproach chosen.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sun is the \nsoul within us. The highest form of knowle=\r\ndge coming from delving&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deep \ninto this aspect is what makes one wa=\r\nde (tar=3Dswim/wade/cross) the ocean&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nof delusion and get to the so=\r\nurce. If you master the knowledge that \nhelps&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one view the world as=\r\n an ocean that needs to be crossed to reach \nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; supreme, other thi=\r\nngs will follow and you eventually get liberation. \nTaaraa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personif=\r\nies this knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Moon is the \nmind within us. The=\r\n highest form of knowledge coming from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; delving deep \ninto this aspe=\r\nct is an understanding of attachments and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; desires, their \nimpermane=\r\nnce and how to kill them. If you master the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledge that \nkills a=\r\nll attachments and desires and gives perfect control&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the mind, \n=\r\nother things will follow and you eventually get liberation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kaali \n=\r\npersonifies this knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mars is the energy and \n=\r\ninitiative within us. The highest form of knowledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; coming from del=\r\nving \ndeep into this aspect is what gives one fearlessness of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anyth=\r\ning in the \nuniverse. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; fearless \nand you do not fear anything (including death or pain!) oth=\r\ner&lt;BR&gt;&gt; things \nwill follow and you eventually get liberation. Bhairavi =\r\npersonifies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; this \nknowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mercury is know=\r\nledge and learning ability \nwithin us. The highest form of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledg=\r\ne coming from delving deep into \nthis aspect is what gives one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lear=\r\nning of various topics. If you master \nthe knowledge that give you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nmastery of all kinds of learning through \nlogical and rational thinking,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; other things will follow and you \neventually get liberation. Maatangi=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personifies this knowledge. In fact, \nsome people associate Maatan=\r\ngi with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Saraswati. Saraswati is also known \nas &quot;Maatanga Kanya&quot;.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jupiter is the intellect, wisdom and \ndiscrimination (dhee s=\r\nhakti) within us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The highest form of knowledge \ncoming from delvin=\r\ng deep into this aspect is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that all is delusion. The \nindividual so=\r\nul and individual mind and everything&lt;BR&gt;&gt; they perceive is just \nan ill=\r\nusion. All that is there is Brahman. Any other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; perceptions, of \nvar=\r\nious good or bad things, are just a delusion, like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; figures made of =\r\n\nsmoke. If you master the knowledge that makes your intellect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; shine=\r\n, you \nwill realize that the entire world is a delusion and not deluded&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; by \nanything anymore. Then other things will follow and you eventually=\r\n get&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nliberation. Dhumaavati personifies this knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Venus is the \nspirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of kno=\r\nwledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; coming from \ndelving deep into this aspect is what makes one=\r\n egoless and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blissful. If \nyou master the knowledge that makes you =\r\nutterly fearless and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you do not \nfear anything, including death or =\r\npain, other things will follow&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and you \neventually get liberation. =\r\nChhinnamasta personifies this knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She \nis depicted as a deit=\r\ny holding her own severed head, standing near a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nnaked couple in co=\r\npulation and surrounded by associates who are drinking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nwine. One m=\r\nastering this knowledge need not stay away from any \npleasures,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but=\r\n one learns to see god even those pleasures. However, \npleasure obtained&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; with an ego (&quot;*I* am enjoying this act or object&quot;) \nbinds. The headle=\r\nss state&lt;BR&gt;&gt; symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome \nI-ness, pleas=\r\nures are not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; binding. One not thinking in terms of &quot;*I* am \nenjoyin=\r\ng&quot; but having no sense&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &quot;I&quot; can live life without running away \nf=\r\nrom any pleasures or undertaking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; any austerities and yet become \nli=\r\nberated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Saturn is the spirit of hard work within us. He a=\r\nlso \nrepresents our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; weaknesses and sins. The highest form of knowle=\r\ndge coming \nfrom delving deep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; into this aspect is what makes us rea=\r\nlize our internal \nenemies and destroy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. If you master the know=\r\nledge that makes you \novercome weaknesses such as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; laziness and inte=\r\nrnal enemies such as lust, \nanger, greed, jealosy etc, other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; things=\r\n will follow and you eventually \nget liberation. Bagalamukhi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; person=\r\nifies this knowledge. Most of her \nmantras ask to destroy enemies and&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; so people foolishly think that she is \nthe one who gives success in&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; litigation and worship her for court cases. \nThis is like going to a ki=\r\nng to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ask for two spoons of sugar for your \nmilk. You go to the kin=\r\ng for bigger&lt;BR&gt;&gt; things and a neighbor is enough for \ngiving you two sp=\r\noons of sugar. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are \ninternal e=\r\nnemies and your own laziness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Remember, she is a mahavidya, \ni.e. a=\r\n type of supreme knowledge that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; liberates you!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Rahu is the spirit of material well-being within us. Rahu is the one \nw=\r\nho&lt;BR&gt;&gt; binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn showing sins and Rahu \ns=\r\nhowing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rebirth are important in the death chart). The highest form =\r\nof \nknowledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what giv=\r\nes us \nworldly success&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a dhaarmik way. If you master the knowled=\r\nge that \nmakes you materially&lt;BR&gt;&gt; successful in a dharmik way, you beco=\r\nme successful \nand fulfil all your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; duties and debts in the world an=\r\nd eventually get \nliberation. Bhuvaneswari&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personifies this knowled=\r\nge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nKetu is the spirit of of detachment and Vedic knowled=\r\nge within us. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nhighest form of knowledge coming from delving de=\r\nep into this aspect is \nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; essense of Veda. If you master the know=\r\nledge that enables you to be \nin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; oneness with the supreme cosmic be=\r\ning, you eventually get liberation. \nKamala&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (Mahaalakshmi) personif=\r\nies this knowledge. According to \nsaptashati rahasya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; also, Mahaalak=\r\nshmi is the Aadyaa (the first One). She \nis the energy of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; supreme c=\r\nosmic being. She divides Herself into 3 parts \n- Mahaakaali,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mahaal=\r\nakshmi and MahaaSaraswati and they create Brahma, \nVishnu, Shiva and&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; their consorts. Kamala represents the knowledge of the \nsupreme cosmic en=\r\nergy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the supreme cosmic being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One of the above \nis not superior to the other. Depending=\r\n on your vasanas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (mental \nconditioning), attitudes, likes and disli=\r\nkes, depending on which&lt;BR&gt;&gt; aspect \nof your personality dominates over =\r\nother aspects (the sinfulness and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nweaknesses? or the interest in l=\r\nearning things? or the spirit of \nfighting?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or the sense of enjoyme=\r\nnt? etc), one Mahavidya may be more \nsuitable than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; others, as that =\r\nknowledge uses your strong aspect and \nmoulds that aspect to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; take y=\r\nou towards liberation. Do not compare them. \nTake the one that is most&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; suitable, but do master that aspect.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are some \nwho do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana by doing one=\r\n Mahavidya&#39;s mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for one \nmonth, then switch to another and so o=\r\nn. They think that by doing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; each \nmahavidya mantra for a certain co=\r\nunt, they &quot;finish&quot; the mahavidya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nsadhana. This is wrong and serves=\r\n no useful purpose. Instead, one should&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \npick any ONE mahavidya and=\r\n succeed in that sadhana. The definition of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nsuccess is that the kn=\r\nowledge represented by that deity becomes part of \nyour&lt;BR&gt;&gt; common sens=\r\ne - you understand that knowledge and ooze that \nknowledge in your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nthoughts and actions. Whether you experience the deity \nas an external&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; human-like form (who may impart some knowledge to you) or \nas an intern=\r\nal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; human-like form or as light or as sound is secondary, but \nthe e=\r\nnd result&lt;BR&gt;&gt; should be that the knowledge represented by Her should \nb=\r\necome common sense&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and second nature to you. One claiming visions o=\r\nr \nsiddhi of a mahavidya but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not showing the corresponding knowledg=\r\ne is \nbluffing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are many people who do mahavidya sad=\r\nhana and \nyet many others who claim&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to have siddhi in one or more m=\r\nahavidyas, but \nvery few who actually possess&lt;BR&gt;&gt; any of the ten mahavi=\r\ndyas. The area of \nmahavidya sadhana is one of the most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ill-underst=\r\nood in today&#39;s age of \nignorance and half-baked knowledge. It is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ea=\r\nsier to possess lower vidyas \nor lower shaktis, but mahavidyas are beyond&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; the capability of \nunderstanding for most people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; B=\r\nest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nNarasimha&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_028E_01C9E897.C16AD6C0--\r\n\n"}}
