Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into prescription =\r\nmedicines and how that ruins some people&#39;s lives. That somehow reminded me =\r\nof a story.\n \nSometime back, mother of a young man came to me to show his c=\r\nhart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was brilliant fro=\r\nm the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale combinations. I de=\r\nclared, &quot;this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but that of a san=\r\nnyasi (ascetic/monk).&quot; She broke down into tears and gave me some backgroun=\r\nd. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and his mother d=\r\noes not want him to.\n \nThis boy had been calm, peaceful, contented and an i=\r\nntrovert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, he had an inter=\r\nesting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father was teaching mat=\r\nh to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voices. Suddenly, h=\r\ne stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anything for a while. Hi=\r\ns mind was completely blacked out. After a while, his mind returned to norm=\r\nalcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous sense of bli=\r\nss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt then.\n \nHe real=\r\nized that what people pursue as happiness is nothing in front of what he ex=\r\nperienced then. He did not want to study or do anything anymore. He only wa=\r\nnted to experience that state. His parents became worried and took him to d=\r\noctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and found nothing. He w=\r\nas also confined to a mental facility for one month. They put him on powerf=\r\nul drugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling the doctors that t=\r\nhere was nothing wrong with him and that they would not understand what he =\r\nexperienced. After a month, those doctors concluded he was normal and had n=\r\no problem. The powerful drugs he received during the month wreaked havoc on=\r\n him, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or doctors. He says he und=\r\nerstands his parents love him and hence they did all this. He does not want=\r\n to hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants but does not know how to=\r\n get it. But he knows that regular studies and regular material life will n=\r\not get him what he wants.\n \nWhen I chatted with him alone, I realized that =\r\nhe is a brilliant young man with clear thinking. He is certainly not a mad =\r\nperson. He just needs someone to show him a spiritual path to make somethin=\r\ng permanent, which temporarily came to him and left him! To get it permanen=\r\ntly now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His parents also took him to many =\r\nso-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied with the advice given anyone. =\r\nHe started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few others and liked some of them.=\r\n But he is still without a clear direction.\n \nInterestingly, just when I wa=\r\ns about to chat with this person after making his parents leave, my guru Ma=\r\nnish called me. He asked me what was going on. I mentioned that I was about=\r\n to talk to a teenager who had a nice chart. He asked for the birthdata, ch=\r\necked it out and confirmed my feeling that this boy had great spiritual pot=\r\nential.\n \nUnfortunately, the system we have in place looked at him with sus=\r\npicion and gave powerful drugs to mess up his mind for one full month! He i=\r\ns lucky and survived the ordeal. This is a sign of the times we live in tha=\r\nt someone who realizes, albeit momentarily, the essence of scriptures, is l=\r\nabeled as a mentally disturbed person and powerful drugs are given to him, =\r\ninstead of clear spiritual direction to make that realization more permanen=\r\nt.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpan=\r\na\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windo=\r\nws): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: htt=\r\np://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0511_01C9FAA3.A708B9F0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I was reading a small interview by Deepak Chopra =\r\non \nMichael Jackson.
