Thank you for the manuals.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\nHave a few questions:\n&gt; \n&gt;   1. When doing the Anujnaa, I had thought about=\r\n you among the Gurus, since you have provided this knowledge to everyone. I=\r\n hope it is OK.\n&gt;   2. Does the count matter when giving the ahuthi, I coun=\r\nted mentally upto 120 or so but did not keep track after it. I was thinking=\r\n keeping prepared myself the next time with\n&gt;    say 108 almonds.\n&gt;   3. I =\r\nhave been inspired by your words lately, and have been reading your posts f=\r\nrom 2002 Nov/Dec.
