I see us focusing on slightly different angles of the same picture and not really disagreeing.\n \n&gt; People are led by their own karma to false Gurus.\n \nAs Vimalananda says, one gets a guru one deserves. If one is attracted to a fake guru and gets misled, it is one&#39;s own karma and conditioning that pulled him that way. You&#39;re right. The root cause of whatever happens to one is in one&#39;s kaarana sareera (causal body) and external things are just symbols projecting a play of one&#39;s own karmas and samskaras externally.\n \n&gt; The Guru as well as the devatha are never external.\n&gt; Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of this fact. \n \nA very correct and wise statement!\n \nTruly speaking, whether one&#39;s guru is a good one or not is a pseudo-question. An unready person may not recognize or benefit from a good guru. If a person is ready and does not have a good guru, it is only a matter of time before Nature sends the right guru. The fact that one is being externally guided by a good guru is a projection of the internal truth that there are no blocking karmas and one is ready to progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNow, I can change the angle a little bit and say the following.\n \nAs external things (including guru) are merely a projection of internal things (karmas and vaasanas), focusing on the external and trying to control it is like putting the bullock cart before the bullock. Seeking to find a sadguru without working on one&#39;s blocking samskaras and karmas is like putting the bucllock cart before the bullock.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; There is little need to look at false Gurus and despair(may be\n&gt; not you, but as many people are wont to). This is like looking\n&gt; at a bad husband or cheating wife and believing that all husbands\n&gt; or wives are like that.\n \nUnfortunately, fake gurus are (will be) slowly becoming the rule and not the exception.\n \nOf course, the majority who get influenced by them do have corresponding karmas. No matter what Paramahamsa Yogananda wrote, no matter what Vimalananda wrote and what we may write, people with corresponding karmas will flock to fake gurus with great hopes of being rescued from the cycle of samsaara.\n \nHowever, there are going to be some (many?) who will read the words of Paramahamsa Yogananda that great masters will no longer descend to earth or the words of Vimalananda and others that good gurus will be tough to find, or our discussions that one is better off doing some sadhana oneself than search for a sadguru, and spend their time on sadhana instead of going around searching for a sadguru as did the person in my example below. Of course, ironically, some of those may end up finding a sadguru, while those who actively search for a sadguru might not find anyone or find a fake one.\n \nThere are many strategies and people are attracted by different strategies based on their karmas and vaasanas, but the stretegy I will suggest is: Pick a sadhana such as homam, japam etc. Keep doing it. Keep working on your attitude. Do not worry about finding a guru. For all you know, a guru may be working on you without even your knowing it. After all, the fact that you are even doing some sadhana and thinking about spiritual progress may be due to some guru somewhere. Who (s)he is, what his/her name is, how (s)he looks like may be irrelevant. If and when it is relevant, Nature will send that guru to you physically. Just keep doing sadhana.\n \nDo not be in a hurry to find a guru, but, once you fully realize that so and so person is your guru and accept so and so person as your guru, be fully devoted to his/her word and have complete faith. Unless you can be like that, there is no point in calling someone your guru.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; My apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or\n&gt; caused any offense.\n \nWhat you said is very good and far from being nonsense.\n \nThere is one person who visits me now and then and discusses vedanta. He is at loggerheads with me on several issues (I intentionally leave out many areas of agreement and focus on angles where he disagrees). He speaks his mind freely, but at the end worries about causing offense to me and is always very apologetic. I say to him, &quot;nobody who is worth apologizing to will be offended by this. Somebody who is offended by this is not worth apologizing to. So, in either case, don&#39;t apologize.&quot;\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- S &lt;tejomaya101@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;                   I have to &#39;disagree&#39; with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru appears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is a shortage of such people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is a shortage of uttama Gurus. \n&gt; \n&gt; Again it is nothing new to say that God must be the Guru. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say - Guru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen between them. In the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the physical being his Guru is not destined to succeed. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even today if a uttama Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya and not an adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million defects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/sadhaka who is still subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limited personalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited personality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.The vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. \n&gt; \n&gt; The very fact that various tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam and sishya lakshanam is very revealing about how things have been for the past few 1000 years at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Guru as well as the devatha are never external.                Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of this fact. \n&gt; \n&gt; People are led by their own karma to false Gurus. There is little need to look at false Gurus and despair(may be not you, but as many people are wont to). This is like looking at a bad husband or cheating wife and believing that all husbands or wives are like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were very clear indications about someone like Nityananda( whom I dont condemn for the particular aspect of having been unable to over come his human weakness) being not a fit Guru. \n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or people could be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counter current even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.\n&gt; \n&gt; My apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or caused any offense.I may have stated the obvious in  many different ways or alluded to things without addressing them. I do not say &#39;dont do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever&#39;; but I do not agree with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and all nonsense that of my limited ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I know one person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a realized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning that he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did not find anyone like that.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting people just like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Why should it be so?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The age of fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters though they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn&#39;t it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this time. How do we reconcile?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to god himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely and unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of the world is today based on the concept of democracy or switching to it slowly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. it made sense to place people&#39;s spiritual lives completely and unconditionally in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit from them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures and just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait patiently. It is a more fruitful method than to search for a sadguru who will lift you.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation, is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say some sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would probably not be able to remain so when born in thid age is a simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web. He is a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing disposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in simple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one has understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most of the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can still fall. Take your mind off god for a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The most important thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps an increase of dharma is not possible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast in key places. We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. Her ways are definitely inscrutable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last few days there are so many Sex scandals by the so called (famous and infamous) spiritual Guru&#39;s like Nithyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan etc etc are being exposed to the masses. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any relationship with these incidents with the establishment of the Dharma as you keep saying in the upcoming years?
