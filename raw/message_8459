So there is no \n=\r\n&gt; point in looking up to me as a &quot;guru&quot; and following me with fervour. Do \n=\r\n&gt; your own search instead (and maximize the chance of someone finding \n&gt; tr=\r\nuth).\n&gt; \n&gt; When it comes to spirituality, I am NOT an enlightened person an=\r\nd not \n&gt; capable of making anyone enlightened. Even if the un-enlightened \n=\r\n&gt; spiritual state I am in is good enough for someone, I do not know how to =\r\n\n&gt; replicate it in someone, either through writings or talks or thoughts. \n=\r\n&gt; In other words, I am capable of giving one NEITHER what one needs in the =\r\n\n&gt; long run NOR what I have right now. All I can give others, through my \n&gt;=\r\n writings, is an understanding that is qualified by their and my \n&gt; conditi=\r\noning (like a white conch exchanged between two people with dirty \n&gt; hands =\r\nmay have the dirty hand prints of the giver or the taker). Yes, I \n&gt; can al=\r\nso share knowhow of some tools that may help you in your pursuit, \n&gt; but th=\r\nat does not make me a guru either.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not just some humble talk, =\r\nbut the *unquestionable* and honest \n&gt; reality. It is better if people who =\r\nare somehow fascinated with me \n&gt; and/or look up to me as a guru and think =\r\nabout me with reverence, divert \n&gt; that attention and reverence towards God=\r\n. Unlike me, God CAN make you a \n&gt; better astrologer or a better spiritual =\r\nsadhaka or both.\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy Guru Pournima again!\n&gt; \n&gt; Love & regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
