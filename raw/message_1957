B =3D Brahman. Hence, A has done b=\r\nad to Brahman. As Brahman is C, A has done bad to C.\n\nIs this logic incorre=\r\nct? Not really, but, it is not correct also.\n\nTo argue, Kali =3D Krishna, u=\r\nsing Kali=3DMoon, Moon=3DKrishna and hence Kali=3DKrishna is not a fully co=\r\nrrect argument. How ever, this could be an argument give proper considerati=\r\non to the statement that Kali=3DKrishna. How ever, in my opinion, this is n=\r\not a conluding argument.\n\nOne of main duty Krishna served was destruction. =\r\nHe played to ensure that there is a battle and that mass destruction happen=\r\ned. He allowed his beloved die with out any attachment and infact instrumen=\r\ntal in some of those deaths (Ghatotkaca for example).\n\nHow ever, I keep won=\r\ndering why Krishna saved Parikhit (son of Abhimanyu and Uttara) (who was ki=\r\nlled by Brahmasironamakastra from Aswathama).\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

See that \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Mahatripurasundari&#39;s spouse is Somanatha, and surely the name Soma-Natha=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; implies that he is the Jyotirlinga associated with the Moon. But in y=\r\nour \n&gt; &gt; list Moon is Kali, so where are we at now with the logic you used =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt; the list you have derived?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of getting caught in supe=\r\nrficial and extraneous factors, let us go to the crux.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mahavidyas and=\r\n their consorts are not showing the same thing, but two different things th=\r\nat have a synergy. The list of planets mapping to mahavidyas and those mapp=\r\ning to mahavidya consorts will accordingly have to be different. I will ela=\r\nborate with examples.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Each mahavidya represents one form of liberatin=\r\ng supreme knowledge that helps one overcome duality and become liberated, s=\r\ntarting from different vantage points within duality and approaching libera=\r\ntion from them. Consorts are the factors that aid in that approach.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; For example, Kaali is equated to Krishna by Munda =\r\nMaalaa Tantra and Krishna is equated to Moon by Parasara. So Kaali is shown=\r\n by Moon. From the perspective of Moon (mind), this duality is a very troub=\r\nlesome temptation and the way to overcome it is to realize its impermanence=\r\n and destroy the duality so that it cannot tempt again.\n&gt;  \n&gt; During this p=\r\nrocess, the ideal companion of Moon is Saturn (vairagya and discipline). So=\r\n the consort of Kaali shown by Moon is Mahakala shown by Saturn.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Take=\r\n Taaraa. She is equated to Raama by Munda Maalaa Tantra and Raama is equate=\r\nd to Sun by Parasara. So Taaraa is shown by Sun. From the perspective of Su=\r\nn (soul), this duality is an ocean of delusion that needs to be waded acros=\r\ns to reach the supreme cosmic soul.\n&gt;  \n&gt; During this process, the ideal co=\r\nmpanion of Sun is Jupiter (intelligence and discrimination). Just as rajagu=\r\nru (Jupiter) guides king (Sun), the intellect and discrimination will aid s=\r\noul in the process of wading the ocean of duality and reaching the supreme.=\r\n So the consort of Taaraa shown by Sun is Akshobhya shown by Jupiter.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Take Chhinnamasta. She is equated to Bhaargava Raama by Munda Maalaa Tantr=\r\na and Bhaargava Raama is equated to Venus by Parasara. So Chhinnamasta is s=\r\nhown by Venus. From the perspective of Venus (enjoyment), this duality need=\r\ns to be enjoyed and not run away from. The symbolism behind Chhinnamasta de=\r\npicted accompanied by a naked couple in copulation and associates drinking =\r\nwine is that nothing is impure and all is Brahman. That is the take of Venu=\r\ns (enjoyment).\n&gt;  \n&gt; During this process, the ideal companion of Venus (enj=\r\noyment) is Ketu (detachment and egolessness). Only when the enjoyment is go=\r\nne through without ego and identification can it be conducive to liberation=\r\n. So the consort of Chhinnamasta shown by Venus is Shiva-Kabandha shown by =\r\nKetu. Kabandha means the headless one.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As Dhumaavati is shown by Jupi=\r\nter (dhee, i.e. intellect and discrimination), there is no need for a compa=\r\nnion. If the force of dhee is there, one realizes that all is god and does =\r\nnot distinguish between good and bad, happy and sad etc and becomes liberat=\r\ned easily. One with a strong aatmabala or manobala can waver and may need s=\r\nupplementing influences, but one with a strong dheeshakti is fine. There is=\r\n no supplementing influence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now let us take=\r\n your example. Mahatripuarasundari is equated to Kalki by Munda Mala Tantra=\r\n and Kalki is equated to lagna by Maharshi Parasara. So Tripura is lagna.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; While Sun and Moon show the soul and mind, lagna shows the individualiz=\r\ned consciousness through which we operate in the world. It includes body an=\r\nd more. It is lagna through which we act in the world. From the point of vi=\r\new of lagna, duality is to be overcome by doing what is expected from us by=\r\n Nature and engaging in actions. Tripura personifies the supreme liberating=\r\n knowledge of using the individualized consciousness to engage in perfect a=\r\nctions in the world to liberate oneself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, the most useful companio=\r\nn of lagna in this process is Moon (mind). The actor within you (lagna) nee=\r\nds mind as mind tells the actor what to do. Thus, the ideal companion of la=\r\ngna is Moon. Accordingly, the consort of Mahatripurasundari shown by lagna =\r\nis Somanatha shown by Moon.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; You can find si=\r\nmilar logic for all of them. Here is the full list:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Kaali (Moon) -=\r\n Mahaa Kaala (Saturn)\n&gt; 2. Taaraa (Sun) - Akshobhya (Jupiter)\n&gt; 3. Mahatrip=\r\nurisundari (Lagna) - Somanaatha (Moon)\n&gt; 4. Bhuvaneswari (Rahu) - Tryambaka=\r\n (Venus)\n&gt; 5. Bhairavi (Mars) - Dakshinaamurti (Sun)\n&gt; 6. Chhinamastaa (Ven=\r\nus) - Shiva-Kabandha (Ketu)\n&gt; 7. Dhumavati (Jupiter) - None\n&gt; 8. Bagalaamuk=\r\nhi (Saturn) - Mahaa Rudra (Mars)\n&gt; 9. Maatangi (Mercury) - Shiva Maatanga (=\r\nRahu)\n&gt; 10. Kamalatmika (Ketu) - Vishnurupi Sadaashiva (Mercury)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Shor=\r\nt notes on the ones I did not cover before:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bhairavi represents the p=\r\nath of Mars, i.e. viewing the duality as a challenge that needs to be fough=\r\nt hard and fearlessly and not fear anything, including death and pain. The =\r\nideal companion is aatmabala, represented by Sun, just as a good king (Sun)=\r\n is an ideal supplement for a good commander (Mars).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bagalaamukhi rep=\r\nresents the path of Saturn, i.e. viewing the duality as that which results =\r\nfrom one&#39;s own weaknesses, sins and internal enemies and seeing a conquest =\r\nof internal enemies as the key to overcoming duality. The fighting spirit r=\r\nepresented by Mars is the ideal companion in the process of overcoming enem=\r\nies. Mahaa Rudra shown by Mars is hence the consort of Bagalamukhi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; M=\r\naatangi represents the path of Mercury, i.e. viewing the duality as that wh=\r\nich needs to be learnt, understood, mastered and then overcome. Free thinki=\r\nng without boundaries, represented by Rahu, is the ideal companion in this =\r\npath. Maatanga means free spirited one or free roamer and Shiva Maatanga is=\r\n such a form of Shiva. He is the consort of Maatangi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Friends, there may be an outcry to my writings from astrologers =\r\nused to a different planet-mahavidya map (which is NOT sanctioned by any sc=\r\nripture and yet popular today in some circles). I may not be able to respon=\r\nd to all the mails.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But please do bear in mind that there is a simple=\r\n and uniform philosophy behind the concept of Mahavidyas. Flowery expositio=\r\nns without a uniform philosophy and even a basic uniform understanding of w=\r\nhat Mahavidyas are for are useless. If you are told logic like &quot;Tripurasund=\r\nari holds sugarcane. Mercury shows sugar cane. So Tripurasundari is shown b=\r\ny Mercury&quot;, reject such superficial logic. If somebody tells you that a mah=\r\navidya is for winning lawsuits or for getting power or getting wealth, reje=\r\nct such things.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please remember that mahavidyas are forms of *supreme=\r\n liberating knowledge*. The path to liberation looks different from the poi=\r\nnt of view of different planets.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Visti Larsen &lt;visti@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ??? ?=\r\n?? ?????\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, Namaskar.\n&gt; &gt; Great... so because crows are bl=\r\nack, as is Krishna&#39;s complexion, so \n&gt; &gt; Crows and Krishna are both Moon.

Se=\r\neing some things as desirable, some as undesirable,\n&gt; &gt; some as pleasurable=\r\n, some as painful, some as beautiful, some as ugly etc is\n&gt; &gt; what binds us=\r\n. Overcoming the duality and seeing all as Brahman is\n&gt; &gt; liberation or mok=\r\nsha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Different planets represent different aspects of our selves. =\r\nThe duality\n&gt; &gt; around us and the way to overcome it seem different from di=\r\nfferent angles.\n&gt; &gt; From the point of view of individual soul (Sun), this m=\r\naayaa is something\n&gt; &gt; that needs to be overcome by crossing and reaching t=\r\nhe other end (supreme\n&gt; &gt; cosmic soul). From the point of view of mind (Moo=\r\nn), this duality is\n&gt; &gt; something that clouds the vision and needs to be de=\r\nstroyed so that it cannot\n&gt; &gt; tempt again. From the point of view of the in=\r\ntellect/discrimination/dhee\n&gt; &gt; (Jupiter), it issomething that is non-exist=\r\nent anyway (&quot;so what was the\n&gt; &gt; problem in the first place?&quot;), like shapes=\r\n made of smoke. From the point of\n&gt; &gt; view of initiative and energy within =\r\nus (Mars), it is something that needs\n&gt; &gt; to be fought hard and fearlessly.=\r\n From the point of view of the learning\n&gt; &gt; ability within us (Mercury), it=\r\n is something that needs to be learnt and\n&gt; &gt; understood fully so that we c=\r\nan overcome it. From the point of view of\n&gt; &gt; enjoyment and happiness (Venu=\r\ns), it is something that needs to be accepted\n&gt; &gt; and enjoyed and not somet=\r\nhing to fear or avoid (&quot;after all, all is Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; Then why stay away f=\r\nrom enjoyments?&quot;). And so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But remember one important thing. Wh=\r\nichever approach is taken to overcoming\n&gt; &gt; duality, the end result is the =\r\nsame. One first masters the approach. It\n&gt; &gt; becomes part of one&#39;s common s=\r\nense and thinking. One eventually overcomes\n&gt; &gt; duality. One becomes self-r=\r\nealized and becomes liberated. That end result is\n&gt; &gt; the same irrespective=\r\n of the approach chosen.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Sun is the =\r\nsoul within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from delving\n&gt; &gt; deep =\r\ninto this aspect is what makes one wade (tar=3Dswim/wade/cross) the ocean\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of delusion and get to the source. If you master the knowledge that help=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; one view the world as an ocean that needs to be crossed to reach the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; supreme, other things will follow and you eventually get liberation. Ta=\r\naraa\n&gt; &gt; personifies this knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Moon is the mind within us. =\r\nThe highest form of knowledge coming from\n&gt; &gt; delving deep into this aspect=\r\n is an understanding of attachments and\n&gt; &gt; desires, their impermanence and=\r\n how to kill them. If you master the\n&gt; &gt; knowledge that kills all attachmen=\r\nts and desires and gives perfect control\n&gt; &gt; on the mind, other things will=\r\n follow and you eventually get liberation.\n&gt; &gt; Kaali personifies this knowl=\r\nedge.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Mars is the energy and initiative within us. The highest fo=\r\nrm of knowledge\n&gt; &gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives=\r\n one fearlessness of\n&gt; &gt; anything in the universe. If you master the knowle=\r\ndge that makes you utterly\n&gt; &gt; fearless and you do not fear anything (inclu=\r\nding death or pain!) other\n&gt; &gt; things will follow and you eventually get li=\r\nberation. Bhairavi personifies\n&gt; &gt; this knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Mercury is kno=\r\nwledge and learning ability within us. The highest form of\n&gt; &gt; knowledge co=\r\nming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives one\n&gt; &gt; learning of v=\r\narious topics. If you master the knowledge that give you\n&gt; &gt; mastery of all=\r\n kinds of learning through logical and rational thinking,\n&gt; &gt; other things =\r\nwill follow and you eventually get liberation. Maatangi\n&gt; &gt; personifies thi=\r\ns knowledge. In fact, some people associate Maatangi with\n&gt; &gt; Saraswati. Sa=\r\nraswati is also known as &quot;Maatanga Kanya&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jupiter is the intellec=\r\nt, wisdom and discrimination (dhee shakti) within us.\n&gt; &gt; The highest form =\r\nof knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is\n&gt; &gt; that all is d=\r\nelusion. The individual soul and individual mind and everything\n&gt; &gt; they pe=\r\nrceive is just an illusion. All that is there is Brahman. Any other\n&gt; &gt; per=\r\nceptions, of various good or bad things, are just a delusion, like\n&gt; &gt; figu=\r\nres made of smoke. If you master the knowledge that makes your intellect\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; shine, you will realize that the entire world is a delusion and not delud=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; by anything anymore. Then other things will follow and you eventuall=\r\ny get\n&gt; &gt; liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Venus=\r\n is the spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of knowledge\n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes one egoless and\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nlissful. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fearless and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; you do not fear anything, including death or pain, other things will foll=\r\now\n&gt; &gt; and you eventually get liberation. Chhinnamasta personifies this kno=\r\nwledge.\n&gt; &gt; She is depicted as a deity holding her own severed head, standi=\r\nng near a\n&gt; &gt; naked couple in copulation and surrounded by associates who a=\r\nre drinking\n&gt; &gt; wine. One mastering this knowledge need not stay away from =\r\nany pleasures,\n&gt; &gt; but one learns to see god even those pleasures. However,=\r\n pleasure obtained\n&gt; &gt; with an ego (&quot;*I* am enjoying this act or object&quot;) b=\r\ninds. The headless state\n&gt; &gt; symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome I-=\r\nness, pleasures are not\n&gt; &gt; binding. One not thinking in terms of &quot;*I* am e=\r\nnjoying&quot; but having no sense\n&gt; &gt; of &quot;I&quot; can live life without running away =\r\nfrom any pleasures or undertaking\n&gt; &gt; any austerities and yet become libera=\r\nted.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Saturn is the spirit of hard work within us. He also represen=\r\nts our\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses and sins. The highest form of knowledge coming from d=\r\nelving deep\n&gt; &gt; into this aspect is what makes us realize our internal enem=\r\nies and destroy\n&gt; &gt; them. If you master the knowledge that makes you overco=\r\nme weaknesses such as\n&gt; &gt; laziness and internal enemies such as lust, anger=\r\n, greed, jealosy etc, other\n&gt; &gt; things will follow and you eventually get l=\r\niberation. Bagalamukhi\n&gt; &gt; personifies this knowledge. Most of her mantras =\r\nask to destroy enemies and\n&gt; &gt; so people foolishly think that she is the on=\r\ne who gives success in\n&gt; &gt; litigation and worship her for court cases. This=\r\n is like going to a king to\n&gt; &gt; ask for two spoons of sugar for your milk. =\r\nYou go to the king for bigger\n&gt; &gt; things and a neighbor is enough for givin=\r\ng you two spoons of sugar. The\n&gt; &gt; enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are int=\r\nernal enemies and your own laziness.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, she is a mahavidya, i.e.=\r\n a type of supreme knowledge that\n&gt; &gt; liberates you!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Rahu is the =\r\nspirit of material well-being within us. Rahu is the one who\n&gt; &gt; binds us t=\r\no rebirth (this is why Saturn showing sins and Rahu showing\n&gt; &gt; rebirth are=\r\n important in the death chart). The highest form of knowledge\n&gt; &gt; coming fr=\r\nom delving deep into this aspect is what gives us worldly success\n&gt; &gt; in a =\r\ndhaarmik way. If you master the knowledge that makes you materially\n&gt; &gt; suc=\r\ncessful in a dharmik way, you become successful and fulfil all your\n&gt; &gt; dut=\r\nies and debts in the world and eventually get liberation. Bhuvaneswari\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npersonifies this knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ketu is the spirit of of detachment an=\r\nd Vedic knowledge within us. The\n&gt; &gt; highest form of knowledge coming from =\r\ndelving deep into this aspect is the\n&gt; &gt; essense of Veda. If you master the=\r\n knowledge that enables you to be in\n&gt; &gt; oneness with the supreme cosmic be=\r\ning, you eventually get liberation. Kamala\n&gt; &gt; (Mahaalakshmi) personifies t=\r\nhis knowledge. According to saptashati rahasya\n&gt; &gt; also, Mahaalakshmi is th=\r\ne Aadyaa (the first One). She is the energy of\n&gt; &gt; supreme cosmic being. Sh=\r\ne divides Herself into 3 parts - Mahaakaali,\n&gt; &gt; Mahaalakshmi and MahaaSara=\r\nswati and they create Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and\n&gt; &gt; their consorts. Kamala =\r\nrepresents the knowledge of the supreme cosmic energy\n&gt; &gt; of the supreme co=\r\nsmic being.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One of the above is not s=\r\nuperior to the other. Depending on your vasanas\n&gt; &gt; (mental conditioning), =\r\nattitudes, likes and dislikes, depending on which\n&gt; &gt; aspect of your person=\r\nality dominates over other aspects (the sinfulness and\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses? or t=\r\nhe interest in learning things? or the spirit of fighting?\n&gt; &gt; or the sense=\r\n of enjoyment? etc), one Mahavidya may be more suitable than\n&gt; &gt; others, as=\r\n that knowledge uses your strong aspect and moulds that aspect to\n&gt; &gt; take =\r\nyou towards liberation. Do not compare them. Take the one that is most\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuitable, but do master that aspect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThere are some who do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana by doing one Mahavidya&#39;s mantr=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; for one month, then switch to another and so on. They think that by d=\r\noing\n&gt; &gt; each mahavidya mantra for a certain count, they &quot;finish&quot; the mahav=\r\nidya\n&gt; &gt; sadhana. This is wrong and serves no useful purpose. Instead, one =\r\nshould\n&gt; &gt; pick any ONE mahavidya and succeed in that sadhana. The definiti=\r\non of\n&gt; &gt; success is that the knowledge represented by that deity becomes p=\r\nart of your\n&gt; &gt; common sense - you understand that knowledge and ooze that =\r\nknowledge in your\n&gt; &gt; thoughts and actions. Whether you experience the deit=\r\ny as an external\n&gt; &gt; human-like form (who may impart some knowledge to you)=\r\n or as an internal\n&gt; &gt; human-like form or as light or as sound is secondary=\r\n, but the end result\n&gt; &gt; should be that the knowledge represented by Her sh=\r\nould become common sense\n&gt; &gt; and second nature to you. One claiming visions=\r\n or siddhi of a mahavidya but\n&gt; &gt; not showing the corresponding knowledge i=\r\ns bluffing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are many people who do mahavidya sadhana and yet=\r\n many others who claim\n&gt; &gt; to have siddhi in one or more mahavidyas, but ve=\r\nry few who actually possess\n&gt; &gt; any of the ten mahavidyas. The area of maha=\r\nvidya sadhana is one of the most\n&gt; &gt; ill-understood in today&#39;s age of ignor=\r\nance and half-baked knowledge. It is\n&gt; &gt; easier to possess lower vidyas or =\r\nlower shaktis, but mahavidyas are beyond\n&gt; &gt; the capability of understandin=\r\ng for most people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
