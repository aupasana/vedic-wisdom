This list should also i=\r\nnclude saints from sufism and\n&gt; other religions\n&gt; We have a good history an=\r\nd books to refer too but we donot have a \n&gt; list of top 50 or so of living =\r\nsaints.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I request you all to contribute if you know and are impress=\r\ned \nwith \n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would be a good thing to have so that many of u=\r\ns can seek \n&gt; darshan and also seek guidance in future.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea here =\r\nis about quality and not so much about quantity \nmeaning\n&gt; very reputed sai=\r\nnts with thousands of disciple are already \nwellknown,\n&gt; I would not mind h=\r\naving them in the list but more important is\n&gt; realized saints who have cho=\r\nsen to remain hidden or have shun\n&gt; publicity.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To Start of I shall =\r\nstart with a very realized saint shri Ganapathy\n&gt; Sacchianand Swamiji of My=\r\nsore, a living Datta Avatar. He is the \n&gt; miracle man. I have had his darsh=\r\nan in US a few times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once while I was on a pilgrimage to Pushkar abou=\r\nt 8 years ago, I \ndid \n&gt; visit a saint known as bengali baba, a very realzi=\r\ned saint in his \n&gt; 90s. He is still alive and has built a very unique hanum=\r\nan temple \nin \n&gt; Pushkar Rajasthan.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a very interesting meeting.=\r\n He spoke bengali only and I\n&gt; spoke hindi. He spoke for an hour. he unders=\r\ntood all of what I said \n&gt; and asked and answered very sincerely in bengali=\r\n in a very \npassionate \n&gt; way, however I could only understand 10% when the=\r\n translator was \nable \n&gt; to keep up with him.\n&gt; My idea  here is to find gr=\r\neat saints in India who are also not \n&gt; wellknown as they may have chosen n=\r\not to publize themselves too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought about this because while growi=\r\nng up, I missed a lot of \n&gt; oppurtunities to meet and seek darshan of many =\r\nwell known saints \nthat \n&gt; I am finding out now about their greatness. I fe=\r\nel like I missed \nmany \n&gt; boats and still remain on the same shore and wait=\r\ning to cross the \n&gt; ocean.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope to get this list going\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
