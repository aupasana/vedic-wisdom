Then of late i.e a week or so a=\r\ngo, I even thought in a creative way to download adobe software the lets yo=\r\nu edit the pdf files.\n \nWow I am very thankful to you, may be even this exc=\r\nuse of mine for not doing homan is gone :-)\n\nThanks once again to you and N=\r\narasimha from the bottom my heart.\n\nNow we have Somavati Amavasya on monday=\r\n, so a good day to do tarpana\nand then devi navratri starting from tuesday.=\r\n\n\nI read in a gujarati newspaper Somavati Amavasya is good for doing remedi=\r\nes for pitru dosh. One can do abhishek to lord shiva on a shiva linga,\nusin=\r\ng sweet milk, sugarcane juice or ghee and chanting simple &quot;om namah shivaya=\r\n&quot; or even maha mrutunjaa mantra.\n\nAgain it appears we are in some special t=\r\nimes right now with 4 planets\nin pisces. This is a special time to do spirt=\r\nual sadhanas.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\npvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Biswajit,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have added homam_prece=\r\ndure_shortmedium.pdf to the files section.\n&gt; \n&gt; I started homam in 2008 Jan=\r\n.
