Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state where one =\r\ndoes not perceive multitude of objects and creational variety. Chitta may s=\r\ntill have some accumulated conditioning left. If that is small enough, aham=\r\nkara may have been allowed to merge in supreme consciousness. But, like a c=\r\nompressed spring expanding, vanished ahamkara (individualized I-ness) may c=\r\nome back in a little time.\n \nWhen conditioning is small enough, one can be =\r\nin nirvikalpa samadhi for long enough. If that happens, that wipes out the =\r\nlittle conditioning left in chitta. One will then merge in Brahman for ever=\r\n. As Ramakrishna said, some special souls may come back to duality after co=\r\nnditioning is completely wiped out.\n \nNormally, it is thought that one stay=\r\ning in nirvikalpa samadhi for a few days is unlikely to come back.

Kundalini remaining in sahasraara forever is moksha.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The four internal instruments (antahkaranas) are manas, buddhi, ahamkaara=\r\n and chitta.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Manas (sensory-motor mind) lies in manomaya kosha (t=\r\nhe mental sheath) and buddhi (intellectual/discriminating mind) lies in the=\r\n vijnaanamaya kosha (the knowledge sheath). These two sheaths, along with t=\r\nhe praanamaya kosha (the vitality sheath) form the so-called sookshma saree=\r\nra (subtle body). Now, apart from the gross physical body and subtle body, =\r\nthere is a causal body (kaarana sareera). This contains the fifth sheath ca=\r\nlled aanandamaya kosha (the bliss sheath).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The antahkaranas that =\r\nlie in this layer are chitta and ahamkaara. Chitta (conditioned/remembering=\r\n mind) stores all previous observations of manas and judgments of buddhi an=\r\nd retrieves them when needed. What is stored to/retrieved from chitta is ba=\r\nsed on I-ness or ahamkaara.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Please note that ahamkaara and chitta=\r\n influence each other. While one&#39;s I-ness influences which experiences are =\r\nadded to the layer of conditioning in chitta, also the mental conditioning =\r\nrepresented by chitta influences what entity one can identify with. If ther=\r\ne is too much heavy conditioning, one&#39;s ahamkaara cannot rise above the fiv=\r\ne elements and one cannot identify with a deity for example.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Norm=\r\nally ahamkaara or I-ness binds itself to an entity that has several dense p=\r\nroperties. If chitta becomes lighter and one can make ahamkaara bind to som=\r\nething with lighter and lighter properties and if one finally succeeds in m=\r\naking ahamkaara not bind itself to anything, i.e. one has no I-ness, then o=\r\nne is established in Brahman without a sense of &quot;this is I&quot;, &quot;this is somet=\r\nhing else&quot; etc. This is nirvikalpa samadhi. However, at that stage, the oth=\r\ner properties of the previously individualized consciousness still remain, =\r\ne.g. 5 jnaanendriyas, 5 karmendriyas, 5 praanas, manas, buddhi and chitta. =\r\nHowever, ahamkaara is not identifying with *anything*, not even with a mani=\r\nfested deity or some energy, and hence one is established in Brahman.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Some conditioning may still be left in chitta when one&#39;s Kundalini rea=\r\nches sahasraara. It may have been subtle enough to let ahamkaara become sil=\r\nent and not identify with any entity for a while. But it may not be empty y=\r\net and suddenly it may spring into action and not let ahamkaara remain sile=\r\nnt anymore. So some thought may be retrived from the conditioned mind and t=\r\nhat may provoke the silenced ahamkaara into returning to action. One may co=\r\nme out of samadhi and regain individualization.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; DRAM (dynamic ran=\r\ndom access memory) used in computers needs to be refreshed now and then. Ot=\r\nherwise, data in it is erased. If the CPU is accessing DRAM now and then an=\r\nd refreshing it, the data stays there. If CPU does not access the data for =\r\ntoo long, then the data is erased. Similarly, if one stays in nirvikalpa sa=\r\nmadhi long enough, all the conditioning in chitta is erased. Then one becom=\r\nes free. If one stayed in nirvikalpa samadhi for a little time, it makes ch=\r\nitta lighter but not empty.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; To give a simple analogy, imagine aha=\r\nmkaara to be the CPU of a computer. Imagine chitta to be the DRAM (memory).=\r\n Imagine buddhi to be the ALU (arithmetic and logical unit) of the CPU. Ima=\r\ngine manas to be the I/O (input/output) interface unit. Though imperfect, t=\r\nhis analogy will help you understand the basics well.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\nhomam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpan=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; w=\r\nrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have the book at the mo=\r\nment but it is my impression that the chapter indicated that the souls in t=\r\nhe suvarna lokas have earlier reached the state of what we call &quot;Kundalini =\r\nrised to Sahsraar Chakra&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; i haven&#39;t given a correct idea in m=\r\ny earlier message when i wrote &quot;...the souls who depart from Sahsraar...&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So i again repeat my query - Kundalini reaching and establishe=\r\nd in Sahasraar chakra is *Final Realisation - complete moksha from all bond=\r\ns* or still there needs to pass through some still higher realm (say for in=\r\nstance Suvarna loka) to workout Karan Shareer/Aanandamaya Kosha. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utp=\r\nalji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice query. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Logically speaking, it maybe that &quot;soul leaving the body&quot; has doe=\r\ns not mean mearging once self awareness into the Brahman. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 1/10/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creation, Physics & Reality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 1 October, 2009, 10:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pra=\r\nnaams,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consciou=\r\nsness (Brahman or &gt;Aatman),where there are no I-ness or any objectification=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does it mean that when consciousness reaches Sahasraar =\r\nChakra, one merges in to Brahman and that is the same state which is named =\r\nvaryingly as Realisation/ Jeevan Mukta/Nirvikalpa Samaadhi/Merging in to br=\r\nahaman etc...?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why i asked you this question is because, i=\r\n am little confused here. if i remember correctly, in &quot;Auto Biography of a =\r\nYogi&quot;, it is mentioned that only the souls who depart from Sahsraar are eli=\r\ngible to enter to Suvarnaa loka and then there they have to still work out =\r\nthe bondage of their Karana Shareera...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not true that Chetana=\r\n reaching Sahsraar means *practically* end of journey.?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nw to reconcile with the above to seemingly different informations?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am only addressing the five elements me=\r\nntioned in upanishads.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies undiff=\r\nerentiated consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), where there are no I-ness or =\r\nany objectification.

For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular t=\r\nhing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state an=\r\nd made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. =\r\na car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water eleme=\r\nnt. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five ele=\r\nments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thi=\r\nnks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart fr=\r\nom the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qua=\r\nlities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has a=\r\nbout who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that se=\r\nlf-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* tha=\r\nt is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still =\r\nremaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* tha=\r\nt is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one i=\r\ns is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people w=\r\nho talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking =\r\nmerely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may stil=\r\nl be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being=\r\n there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a so=\r\nlid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kunda=\r\nlini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea=\r\n of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existence! T=\r\no completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;=\r\n), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towar=\r\nds samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes=\r\n down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, f=\r\nire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physi=\r\ncs tries to describe/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceive=\r\nd by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without=\r\n the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simp=\r\nle example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see=\r\n&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another example, a=\r\n yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some sce=\r\nnes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived by the exte=\r\nrnal senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can be pe=\r\nrceived by the external senses, because different people can experience the=\r\n same reality using their senses individually and verify the observation. H=\r\nowever, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are=\r\n sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liber=\r\nating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawb=\r\nack of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as ima=\r\nginations or hallucinations, because there is no independent validation, an=\r\nd call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. =\r\nFor example, see the following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a specific yogic e=\r\nxperience that was described in detail and another person seemed to know ab=\r\nout it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experience, suggest=\r\ning that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it wa=\r\ns beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic=\r\n- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message als=\r\no, one person had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail =\r\nand another person seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangibl=\r\ne details relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the=\r\n experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external senses o=\r\nf either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god=\r\n (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom=\r\n/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one perso=\r\nn had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another person perc=\r\neived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity, though ot=\r\nhers in the room could not perceive anything with their external senses, su=\r\nggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first pers=\r\non through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that=\r\n perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the ext=\r\nernal senses are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to o=\r\nbserve. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences tha=\r\nt cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of th=\r\ne &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can=\r\n modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thi=\r\nng that can be studied and measured is the reality involving the gross body=\r\n and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be=\r\n studied by observing various parts of the gross physical body. For example=\r\n, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of the =\r\nbrain and try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But=\r\n, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there i=\r\ns some correspondence between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross =\r\nbodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which=\r\n case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. what=\r\never they model can be moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses fro=\r\nm the road, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular hous=\r\ne with a lot of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be having=\r\n a party. People in one particular house with no lights are probably out of=\r\n town. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many pe=\r\nople are inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the =\r\nhouse from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at t=\r\nhe nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see s=\r\nome basic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyo=\r\nnd your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical do=\r\nmain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfor=\r\ntunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality which is bey=\r\nond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yogis and develo=\r\np mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis =\r\nof ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the microcosm =\r\nof the entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, even the gr=\r\neatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. When Kundalini=\r\n rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of the Infinit=\r\ne Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes and exactly =\r\nwhich part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have a pe=\r\nrfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail=\r\n went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of S=\r\nri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - it mayb=\r\ne of some help to you.

Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of=\r\n Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some univer=\r\nsal energies which are more commonly known as the universal deities like Sh=\r\niva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the=\r\n actual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence of the element=\r\n, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with=\r\n the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agn=\r\ni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and each one resul=\r\nting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible =\r\nstates of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in =\r\nthere (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some=\r\n correlation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string th=\r\neory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This=\r\n is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I ha=\r\nve the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands =\r\nnow, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theories of the String v=\r\nariety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one=\r\n) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the =\r\nphysical world. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five=\r\n elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand som=\r\ne correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Int=\r\nerpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a l=\r\nink between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more a=\r\nbout how exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited u=\r\nnderstand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, s=\r\nince the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theorit=\r\nical physics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of =\r\nreality? These two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gaug=\r\ne reality. It need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is =\r\nwhy Richard Feynman once famously quoted that everyone knows that Quatum Me=\r\nchanics works, but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence o=\r\nf everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing=\r\n more left to do. Physics is still quite far away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@=\r\n &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get the thrust of your point.
