In Vedas, there are many hymns in Gayatri chhandas to various deities.\n \nHowever, most of the &quot;vidmahe-dhImahi&quot; mantras that people chant these days are not part of Vedas themselves, but added on later by people as a part of other literature associated with Vedas. In fact, most of these hymns are not even in Gayatri chhandas and grossly off the metre (e.g. the famous Narasimha Gayatri with &quot;tanno naarasi{&#92;m+}haH prachodayaat&quot;)!\n \nInstead of such hymns created by people, it is better to stick to a mantra from Veda, which was not created by anyone but simply &quot;heard&quot; by a rishi when he was in a deeply meditative state and then shared by him/her with the world.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI can comspletely believe the claim that hymns from Veda were &quot;heard&quot; by rishis. Though I am a normal person with a very minor level of realization, I had my share of experiences when my rational mind and intuitive mind were sufficiently calmed down in deep meditation. During such experiences, I sometimes heard some accented hymns as well as some beejaaksharas clearly and loud. Hearing of sound is accompanied by seeing something and also an overall understanding that just sets in instantaneously. Whatever I experienced was despite my several weaknesses and despite my still-alive ego. If such things can happen to someone like me, I can imagine what a rishi with a far higher level of realization and far subtler ego can experience. Thus, I conclude based on my direct experiences that it is entirely plausible that Vedas were simply heard (&quot;shruti&quot;) and not composed by anyone.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere are MANY hymns in Gayatri chhandas to goddess Saraswati. They all can be called &quot;Saraswati Gayatri&quot;. However, the most popular of them is the following hymn from R^igveda. This text can be cut & pasted to ITranslator software from Omkaranand Ashram to see the hymn in Devanagari script with the Vedic accents marked.\n \nOM praNo&#92;&#39;&#39; de&#92;_vI sara&#92;&#39;svatI&#92;_ vaaje&#92;&#39;&#39;bhirvaa&#92;_jinI&#92;&#39;&#39;vatI.\ndhI&#92;_naama&#92;&#39;vi&#92;_trya&#92;&#39;vatu..\n \nThe last line is one word (dhInaaM + avitrI + avatu). Try to read it without any gaps or breaks.\n \nDoing samputikarana of this Veda mantra with beejaaksharas as shown below can be useful to increase knowledge, intelligence and eloquence.\n \nOM aiM klIM sauH praNo&#92;&#39;&#39; de&#92;_vI sara&#92;&#39;svatI&#92;_ vaaje&#92;&#39;&#39;bhirvaa&#92;_jinI&#92;&#39;&#39;vatI.\ndhI&#92;_naama&#92;&#39;vi&#92;_trya&#92;&#39;vatu sauH klIM aiM OM..\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; On this Teachers day, I would like to ask what is the correct Saraswati\n&gt; Gayatri mantra?
