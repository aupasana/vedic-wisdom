For instance, recently elsewhere =\r\nyou explained a difficult thing using the example of various components of =\r\na Computer. Can you please explain the subtle existence of various Gods and=\r\n Godesses? While some say they are feverish human imagination, Sri Aurobind=\r\no writes that Gods are real, perhaps more real than us humans with a differ=\r\nence, they have enormous Power and influence over the workings of the Unive=\r\nrse, and they can be cajoled, placated,forced or get punished etc.Please en=\r\nlighten us in your own way.\n\nRegards,\n\nJ.
