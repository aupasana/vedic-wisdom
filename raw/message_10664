VS if I chant 108 Na=\r\nmes of Durga =E2=80=93 which is more effective?\n\nI am in a strange problem =\r\nactually. Since I am in the japa for 12 years =E2=80=93 I see their power a=\r\nlways. But For last one year or so, I also recite stotram, and I THINK THEY=\r\n ARE MORE POWERFUL. However, since I saw power of japa for MANY YEARS, psyc=\r\nhologically I cannot leave them out. \n\nSo the situation is like, I want to =\r\ndo 2 hours of japa, then another 2 hours of recitation of stotram (path). W=\r\nhich is almost impossible for me. 2 hrs of japa puts a huge strain on my vo=\r\nice =E2=80=93 my throat actually somewhat burns for continuous chanting for=\r\n 1-2 hours. And generally I get a headache also. I become extremely tired t=\r\no keep my body still for 2 hours and chant =E2=80=93 though a little rest a=\r\nfter chanting gets me alright again. Anyway, so what I should do, is to lea=\r\nve out japa and only do the path (recitation) =E2=80=93 but psychologically=\r\n I don=E2=80=99t feel like to miss out the chanting, I do not want to miss =\r\ntheir power. But, it is actually being quite impossible for me.\n\nWhat is yo=\r\nur opinion? Do you also agree to me that recitation of a stotram is more po=\r\nwerful than chanting a mantra?\n\nThanks\nTanvir\r\n------=_NextPart_000_002F_01D09D78.29675AA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: &#39;Arial&#39;; COLOR: #800080; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: =\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Namaste everyone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What you think to be more effective, Japa of a mantra=\r\n (on tulsi / \nrudraksha mala) or reciting stotram?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As an example if =\r\nI chant =E2=80=9COm Namo \nBhagavate Rudraya=E2=80=9D on mala VS I recite th=\r\ne 108 names of Lord Shiva for the same \namount of time, which one is going =\r\nto more effective?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nSTRONG&gt;Another example =E2=80=93 if I chant a simple short Durga mantra, wh=\r\nich \ntakes around 15 minutes to complete one mala...
