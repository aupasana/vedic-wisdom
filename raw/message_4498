If so, which aut=\r\nhoritative text have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself kee=\r\nping the convenience factor in mind ?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There are many procedures =\r\neven within the vedic system for performing homam. Each established procedu=\r\nre given by acharyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate th=\r\ne fundamental principles of vedic rituals.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It will be interestin=\r\ng here to point out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform =\r\nsraadham=C2=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is c=\r\nalled panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictu=\r\nm called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be perform=\r\ned on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever prese=\r\nnt in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. The=\r\nre is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say t=\r\nhat homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the pr=\r\noblem arises.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As you have said, any system of worship is accepta=\r\nble. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody obj=\r\nects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the=\r\n vedic tenets.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you=\r\n bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is not a questi=\r\non of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior o=\r\nr which is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on=\r\n what vedic authority. If you are promoting this homa procedure as one of y=\r\nour own design, there is no objection. On the contrary, if you need the san=\r\nction of vedic authority for it, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of ved=\r\nic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts are raised.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The apprehension is that=\r\n in the year 2000 you said,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;I cannot possibly finish this prefa=\r\nce without expressing my deep gratitude for my \n&gt; guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who=\r\n has been a constant source of enlightenment, \n&gt; encouragement and inspirat=\r\nion. I am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; and now you say\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secrets and some g=\r\neneric guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all other paramparas) =\r\nfrom his elders. He then read some books and formed his understanding. As h=\r\ne started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;parampara se=\r\ncrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and started to manufac=\r\nture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he became commercial=\r\n and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Yes,=\r\n his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, which is really superf=\r\nicial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His theories are like beautiful=\r\n structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always maintains an air o=\r\nf &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is convenient to give the impress=\r\nion that there is more. If anything does not make sense, it could be becaus=\r\ne you have to learn more!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As he started exploiting and commercia=\r\nlizing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I=\r\n took an exception to the commercialization and dishonesty. After expressin=\r\ng my reservations privately and having no effect, I started to go public, f=\r\nirst subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of S=\r\nJC.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas=\r\n, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviate=\r\ns from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work consistent=\r\nly.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some specific secret=\r\ns (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imperfect too)=\r\n. Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily created a body of k=\r\nnowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teachings that can=\r\n be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In 2000 you said\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa=\r\n. It shows general\n&gt; results. Narayana dasa is computed differently for dif=\r\nferent divisional charts and we\n&gt; can use Narayana dasa of a divisional cha=\r\nrt to predict matters related to that\n&gt; divisional chart.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Naraya=\r\nna dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one =\r\ndasa ends\n&gt; and another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna a=\r\nnd another rasi\n&gt; becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progres=\r\nsed lagna as the reference, we\n&gt; find out the events that happen in that da=\r\nsa. Thus we get twelve charts for each\n&gt; person, with each chart applicable=\r\n in one dasa.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This is a very versatile dasa system and readers s=\r\nould pay attention to the details of\n&gt; calculation.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; now you say=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa may be based on some genuine parampara knowledge=\r\n, but it does not work with any level of consistency. I am afraid it needs =\r\nrefinement.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You seem to start teaching even before you=C2=A0sta=\r\nrt learning.=C2=A0I&#39; m only afraid it should not happen in the context of v=\r\nedic rituals also.

There are many standard homam procedures in the world today, some m=\r\nore elaborate than what we teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly=\r\n what procedure one uses and I will be happy if more and more people do hom=\r\nam *regularly*, irrespective of the exact procedure used! What I teach is O=\r\nNE procedure for those who do not know any. If you are initiated into a dif=\r\nferent procedure that you can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the=\r\n way you know it. That will make us very happy. However, if the method you =\r\nknow cannot be done daily, please consider what I taught, which is simple e=\r\nnough to do daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose there are rules and protocols on=\r\n how one should serve lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates,=\r\n spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in wh=\r\nat order to serve various items in those containers. Suppose the protocol i=\r\ns so complex that one cannot do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a l=\r\nunch once every few months.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that better or is it better to relax th=\r\ne rules and protocols to make it less formal and serve lunch to parents eve=\r\nryday?\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of know=\r\nledge in its own purity.\n&gt; &gt; Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let=\r\n almighty help to preserve\n&gt; &gt; knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only knowled=\r\nge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that =\r\nis *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolu=\r\nte knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can neve=\r\nr be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impu=\r\nre or corrupt about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the day, the key is whether one =\r\nis actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is cau=\r\nsing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s s=\r\npiritual progress or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me cut & paste a section from=\r\n a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given e=\r\narlier and addresses some relevant issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; Do Vedas Describe External Rituals\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people believe that Veda =\r\ndescribes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to =\r\nbe absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaa=\r\nla-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by =\r\ndesa-kaala-paatra?\n&gt; \n&gt; Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary=\r\n on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take =\r\nin his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks ab=\r\nout absolute truths about the inner self and not relative truths about exte=\r\nrnal matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is th=\r\ne immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable=\r\n and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, va=\r\nrious offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioni=\r\nng and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Metaph=\r\nor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; Notions that so and so yagya ritual i=\r\ns sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanc=\r\ntioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once there =\r\nwere many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the=\r\n sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of=\r\n the time]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAs people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolv=\r\ned], someone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea.=\r\n He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. =\r\nPeople faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n&gt; \n&gt; People started =\r\nmoving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert=\r\n far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like=\r\n a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking t=\r\nowards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had t=\r\no walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of=\r\n thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or =\r\nsome interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhen came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead=\r\n of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did fi=\r\nnd the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach =\r\nthe sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n&gt; \n&gt; Pe=\r\nople performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this ho=\r\nrse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and differe=\r\nnt from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not =\r\neven understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, =\r\nbut they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals=\r\n that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original ins=\r\ntructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instruc=\r\ntions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they curren=\r\ntly lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n&gt; \n&gt; Slowly many new sets o=\r\nf instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new path=\r\ns to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk towar=\r\nds east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].\n&gt; \n&gt; One particular path thro=\r\nugh jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving pr=\r\nactice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter=\r\n through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and st=\r\nrongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of=\r\n a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that =\r\npath were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forwar=\r\nd, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since =\r\nthen, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that pa=\r\nth desisted from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As time progressed, people started fighting too m=\r\nuch about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to a=\r\ndopt the original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or =\r\nthe so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and=\r\n changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and =\r\ndid not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the a=\r\nctual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to f=\r\nollow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the cha=\r\nnged geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actuall=\r\ny went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and ti=\r\nme, for violating tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; In case the analogy is not clear, here is=\r\n a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities=\r\n such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly di=\r\nfferent aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of s=\r\nelf-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other =\r\nallied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. Whil=\r\ne definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of sel=\r\nf-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach =\r\nit. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The pa=\r\nth depends on one&#39;s current position!\n&gt; \n&gt; Great men in many spiritual path=\r\ns, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, =\r\nunderstood the current state of people around them and gave specific instru=\r\nctions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the=\r\n instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about th=\r\ne contradictions between paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; As th=\r\ne metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant =\r\nand distracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether=\r\n one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The prima=\r\nry issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=\r\n=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Just as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give mu=\r\nch energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once=\r\n every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or mater=\r\nial pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday g=\r\nives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a b=\r\noost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wise Tradeoffs\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose=\r\n the president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates=\r\n. One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat t=\r\nhem in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one can exc=\r\nhange long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppo=\r\nse one is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the=\r\n 100 associates by name and seats them in the room individually following t=\r\nhe protocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in=\r\n the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 assoc=\r\niates together and seat them together by violating the protocol and use tha=\r\nt time to let the President eat in peace?\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, is it wise if one=\r\n exchanges long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should o=\r\nne cut short on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a fire =\r\nritual, making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upa=\r\ncharas done to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Variou=\r\ns preliminary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertia=\r\nry. If one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given=\r\n in scriptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make =\r\nwise tradeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;sections deleted&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Proof of the Pudding\n&gt; \n&gt; At this time, mor=\r\ne than hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyda=\r\ny. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, =\r\nwith an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual understandin=\r\ng of the absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world o=\r\nf good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in=\r\n eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months =\r\nand see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, foc=\r\nus and clarity of thinking.\n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.or=\r\ng\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writ=\r\nings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamaga=\r\nmagguru@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the outset, thanks to Sh=\r\nri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had posted a message in=\r\n jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedi=\r\nes&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing these =\r\ntopics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Naras=\r\nimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have the following obse=\r\nrvations to make.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya su=\r\ntras which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) =\r\ncan only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all =\r\nyajnas).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the ho=\r\nmam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be t=\r\nhere). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not essenti=\r\nal. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as apast=\r\namba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become wo=\r\nrthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure=\r\n. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire rit=\r\nual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staa=\r\nl to get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. The proc=\r\nedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are larg=\r\ne deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proced=\r\nures. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda the=\r\nre is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucke=\r\nd under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7. The direction for spr=\r\ninkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie=\r\n:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because a=\r\npasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and =\r\nending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keepi=\r\nng the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils =\r\nis missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missi=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna po=\r\nojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 13=\r\n. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the hom=\r\na dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purifi=\r\ncation of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be u=\r\nsed (sruksruvou).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is mis=\r\nsing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits =\r\nin the agni iis missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a s=\r\ningle dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. The=\r\nre is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will l=\r\nead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and many more ............\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. Strictl=\r\ny speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni=\r\n alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya=\r\n vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni ca=\r\nrries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it i=\r\ns gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure=\r\n, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadha=\r\nragni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatma=\r\nka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 19. Very g=\r\nood alternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Man=\r\ntra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mant=\r\nras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and s=\r\nvaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam =\r\non their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out tha=\r\nt can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and p=\r\nractice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest tha=\r\nt we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not a=\r\nlways yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupt=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-936613322-1277043048=:37691\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Sri.Utpalji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am extremely sorry and sincerely apologize if I have conveyed an i=\r\nmpression that I am personally attacking Narasimhaji.

If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon=\r\n? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind =\r\n?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are many procedures even within the vedic sy=\r\nstem for\n performing homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas&nb=\r\nsp; is complete&nbsp;in itself and do not violate the fundamental principle=\r\ns of vedic rituals.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It will be interesting here to p=\r\noint out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham&nb=\r\nsp;do the&nbsp;hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panih=\r\nomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; =\r\nbrahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the r=\r\night hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the r=\r\night hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no de=\r\nfect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa ca=\r\nn be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arise=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As you have said, any system of worship is accept=\r\nable. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody\n o=\r\nbjects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to t=\r\nhe vedic tenets.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homam is a ritualistic form of wors=\r\nhip and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elabor=\r\nate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether =\r\nit is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you are promoting this =\r\nhoma procedure as one of your own design, there is no objection. On the con=\r\ntrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for it, please&nbsp;answ=\r\ner within the ambit of vedic knowledge&nbsp;if doubts are raised.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my =\r\ndeep gratitude for my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constan=\r\nt source of enlightenment, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; encouragement and inspiration.\n I am et=\r\nernally grateful to him&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and now you say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secret=\r\ns and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all other =\r\nparamparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his underst=\r\nanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;=\r\nparampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and starte=\r\nd to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he becam=\r\ne commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization=\r\n, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His the=\r\nories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji a=\r\nlways maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is conven=\r\nient to give the impression that there is more. If anything\n does not make =\r\nsense, it could be because you have to learn more!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A=\r\ns he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived kn=\r\nowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to the commercializ=\r\nation and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations privately and having=\r\n no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After s=\r\neveral clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With basic =\r\nconcepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic=\r\n guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates from Parasara in several=\r\n matters and his teachings do not work consistently.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some specific secrets (that are im=\r\nperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imperfect too). Starting fro=\r\nm that base and reading books, he hastily created a body of knowledge which=\r\n he sells now. If there is anything in his teachings\n that can be used rela=\r\ntively reliably, it is TP.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In 2000 you said&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It i=\r\ns a phalita dasa. It shows general&lt;BR&gt;&gt; results. Narayana dasa is comput=\r\ned differently for different divisional charts and we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; can use Naray=\r\nana dasa of a divisional chart to predict matters related to that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; d=\r\nivisional chart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narayana dasa is based on the progr=\r\nession of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and another=\r\n starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another rasi&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progressed lagna as the =\r\nreference, we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; find out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we=\r\n get twelve charts for each&lt;BR&gt;&gt; person, with each chart applicable in o=\r\nne dasa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is a very versatile dasa system and re=\r\naders sould pay attention to the details of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n calculation.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; now you say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa may be bas=\r\ned on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not work with any level=\r\n of consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Y=\r\nou seem to start teaching even before you&nbsp;start learning.&nbsp;I&#39; m on=\r\nly afraid it should not happen in the context of vedic rituals also. From t=\r\nhe pronunciation &nbsp;of the person who is performing the homam in the vid=\r\neo, it is quite obvious that he is at an entry level.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; If you agree that you are not trying to propagate vedic knowledge, I have=\r\n no more points&nbsp; to make.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Are there different ways you teach a person to fly a=\r\nn aeroplane depending on what he knows and what he does ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; 3. &quot;Knowledge of *external rituals* is\n relative and can never be abs=\r\nolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or co=\r\nrrupt about it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rituals do evolve around desa and k=\r\naala but if it starts evolving around paatra it is a dangerous trend.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A car still runs on four wheels.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4=\r\n. &quot;The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption=\r\n is knowledge that is *absolute*.

There are many s=\r\ntandard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what =\r\nwe teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses=\r\n and I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespec=\r\ntive of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those w=\r\nho do not know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that yo=\r\nu can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That w=\r\nill make us very happy.\n However, if the method you know cannot be done dai=\r\nly, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppose there are rules and protocols o=\r\nn how one should serve lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates=\r\n, spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in w=\r\nhat order to serve various items in those containers. Suppose the protocol =\r\nis so complex that one cannot do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a =\r\nlunch once every few months.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is that better or is it bette=\r\nr to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal and serve lunch t=\r\no parents everyday?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 21. I sugg=\r\nest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge uncorrupted.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The only knowledge th=\r\nat should (and\n can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *=\r\nabsolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute k=\r\nnowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and =\r\ncan never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is noth=\r\ning impure or corrupt about it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At the end of the day, the=\r\n key is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or no=\r\nt, whether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whether=\r\n it helps in one&#39;s spiritual progress or not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me cut &amp; paste a section from a writeup I wrote for an u=\r\npcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given earlier and addresses some r=\r\nelevant issues.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do V=\r\nedas Describe External Rituals&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some people believe that Ve=\r\nda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed =\r\nto be\n absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa=\r\n-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound=\r\n by desa-kaala-paatra?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celeb=\r\nrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a=\r\n different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is th=\r\nat Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relative t=\r\nruths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That=\r\n is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything th=\r\nat is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the=\r\n divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=\r\n=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and de=\r\nsires.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and s=\r\no aagamic/tantric yagya ritual\n is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in per=\r\nspective using a metaphor.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Once there were many people who=\r\n lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the=\r\n sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They des=\r\ncribed the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As peopl=\r\ne started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], som=\r\neone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said=\r\n, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People f=\r\naithfully followed the instructions [rituals].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; People star=\r\nted moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked de=\r\nsert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water =\r\nlike a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walki=\r\nng towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one h=\r\nad to walk one mile or\n two miles or three miles and formed different schoo=\r\nls of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a buildin=\r\ng or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to tak=\r\ne a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other =\r\ntools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instr=\r\nuctions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and=\r\n tantra].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; People performing the old rituals objected to th=\r\nis and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. T=\r\nhis is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic rit=\r\nual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the =\r\noriginal &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taug=\r\nht the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully =\r\nunaware that the\n original instructions were meant for someone already clos=\r\ne to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the =\r\nsea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from ther=\r\ne!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, =\r\nchariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instea=\r\nd of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tant=\r\nra/yantras].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One particular path through jungles was dange=\r\nrous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, =\r\nwine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle,=\r\n it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it=\r\n. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ri=\r\ntual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A w=\r\nise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that pat=\r\nh and\n discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people wh=\r\no were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As time progressed, people started fighting too much abou=\r\nt whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the=\r\n original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-c=\r\nalled &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed=\r\n times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not =\r\nreach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual go=\r\nal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow th=\r\ne instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geo=\r\ngraphical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went t=\r\no sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for =\r\nviolating tradition.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In case the analogy is not clear,\n he=\r\nre is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic de=\r\nities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slight=\r\nly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state=\r\n of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. O=\r\nther allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state.=\r\n While definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state o=\r\nf self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to r=\r\neach it. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. T=\r\nhe path depends on one&#39;s current position!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Great men in ma=\r\nny spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experie=\r\nnced that state, understood the current state of people around them and gav=\r\ne specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current state. =\r\nSome followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some\n instead kep=\r\nt arguing about the contradictions between paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Stop Arg=\r\nuing and Do Sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As the metaphor above illustrates, arg=\r\numents about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What is importan=\r\nt is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aag=\r\namic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether one does ho=\r\nmam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and ho=\r\nw one is being transformed internally.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just as a twenty co=\r\nurse meal eaten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =\r\n=E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or=\r\n a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just a=\r\ns a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy to =\r\none, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99=\r\ns spiritual evolution.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wise Tradeoffs&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sup=\r\npose the\n president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 assoc=\r\niates. One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and s=\r\neat them in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one ca=\r\nn exchange long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppose one is in a hurry and has very little time. If one stil=\r\nl invites all the 100 associates by name and seats them in the room individ=\r\nually following the protocol and does not have enough time to let the Presi=\r\ndent eat lunch in the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite =\r\nall the 100 associates together and seat them together by violating the pro=\r\ntocol and use that time to let the President eat in peace?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Similarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and gives very li=\r\nttle time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries and give more=\r\n time to eat?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In a fire ritual, making offerings to the ma=\r\nin\n deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before t=\r\nhe offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and=\r\n offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for th=\r\ne fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one =\r\nhas only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the b=\r\nenefit. It is far better than doing nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;sections =\r\ndeleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Proof of the Pudding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At this =\r\ntime, more than hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the other=\r\n, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) e=\r\nveryday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual und=\r\nerstanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do =\r\na world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudd=\r\ning is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a fe=\r\nw\n months and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s att=\r\nitude, focus and clarity of thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilm=\r\ns.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt;=\r\n wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Members,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; At the outse=\r\nt, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had post=\r\ned a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;eff=\r\nicacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for di=\r\nscussing these topics.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have gone through the h=\r\nomam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being perf=\r\normed and have the following observations to make.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; 1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the =\r\npreocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of=\r\n the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam pr=\r\nocedure (some\n exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there)=\r\n. We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not essential. T=\r\nhey are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras =\r\nsuch as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omis=\r\nsions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wo=\r\nod, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divi=\r\nnised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. O=\r\ntherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volu=\r\nmnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of th=\r\nese steps.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not=\r\n as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions=\r\n. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;\n 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a=\r\n particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under=\r\n the bottom of the prceeding ones.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 7. The direct=\r\nion for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita =\r\nprasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not b=\r\ne because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE =\r\ncorner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel a=\r\nbove darbha is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram a=\r\nnd prokshanam for purification of the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, v=\r\naruna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is\n missi=\r\nng.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brah=\r\nma) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or purificati=\r\non of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is mis=\r\nsing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purification of la=\r\ndles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksru=\r\nvou).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit =\r\nis missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a=\r\n fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghe=\r\ne, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to b=\r\ne given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; and many more ............&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 18. Stri=\r\nctly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked\n into agni. =\r\nAgni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (h=\r\navya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agn=\r\ni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked =\r\nit is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 18. In=\r\n the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni ac=\r\nts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted in=\r\nto the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahuti=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are a=\r\nvailable in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal fo=\r\nr sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to strug=\r\ngle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designe=\r\nd for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily ad=\r\napted to perfrom homam for any devata.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 20. Homa=\r\nm should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned=\r\n from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice with dev=\r\notion, precision and perfection.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest t=\r\nhat we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not=\r\n always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorru=\r\npted.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;=\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-936613322-1277043048=:37691--\r\n\n"}}
