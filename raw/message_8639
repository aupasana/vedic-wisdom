Secondly, one may dislike a c=\r\nuisine at first and slowly get hooked. All these variables are there. But, =\r\neventually, one needs to enjoy what one is eating, to digest well. Similarl=\r\ny, one needs to eventually start enjoying one&#39;s sadhana, to progress spirit=\r\nually.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Having said that, fire is s=\r\nomething separate and special. Almost every ancient culture and civilizatio=\r\nn worshipped god in sacred fire.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;No matter what kind of food o=\r\nne eats, eating some ginger can provoke one&#39;s appetite and make one digest =\r\nbetter. Similarly, no matter what kind of sadhana one does, doing some fire=\r\n worship can\n provoke one&#39;s internal fire and make one digest better.&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Also, just as a good nutritionist working with one can help one in =\r\npicking the right balance of foods, a good guru or mentor working with one =\r\ncan help one in picking the right balance of sadhanas.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;So a go=\r\nod guru/mentor and company of fire are two things that put one in good stea=\r\nd, irrespective of what else one does.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;I do not like to comment on specific people or organizations. But, I&#39;d=\r\n *in general* be suspicious of anyone who says they have a special and effe=\r\nctive spiritual path, then controls and guards the details tightly and puts=\r\n a price on it. That is not the way of rishis. That is not the way of Sanat=\r\nana Dharma.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;But if one tries such a path and benefits, good fo=\r\nr them. I&#39;d personally stay away from such organizations.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;BTW,=\r\n I am\n not a &quot;guruji&quot;, though I answered your question.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best r=\r\negards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Guruji,=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Please explain do we burn bad karma by performing homa o=\r\nr&lt;br&gt;&gt; sudarshan kriya o&#92;f art of living.
