Impossible it is not. Pick the time in such a way that you will be able to do it at that time everyday. For example, if the time of coming back home is not in your hands, do it in the morning before you go to work. If you come home late oneday, sleep less and somehow wake up and do it at that time.\n \n2) This is a difficult niyama and takes many years to get perfection. To start with, keep physical restraint and divert the mind whenever it has those thoughts.\n \n3) No, any prasiddha mantra can be used.\n \n4) Then don&#39;t. :-) Each rule contributes in a different way to success. If one is unable to follow some rules, one can then follow whatever rules one is able to follow.\n \n5) Yes, even Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s direct disciples thought like that sometimes and wanted to go back and lead &quot;regular lives&quot;. Luckily they didn&#39;t and many people are benefiting even today.\n \nIn the early stages, such thoughts are normal. Those who use their will power to persist will persist and achieve some level of success later on. Those who cannot (or do not) use their will power to persist end up giving up and postponing it to a later day (or a later life), when the hurdles may be even greater.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; I reread yours and Manish&#39;s post on and Urdhwaretas and &#39;On Remedial Measures Difference&#39;.\n&gt; Please answer a few queries of mine.\n&gt; 1) Out of the points he mentioned\n&gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; Same place.\n&gt; Same materials.\n&gt; Same direction.\n&gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; before you start.\n&gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; Isn&#39;t doing the sadhna &#39;Same time every day.&#39; difficult because of job requirements?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)How do you have restraint on sex from the mind? i have tried for body but still manytimes\n&gt; these thoughts come to my mind and with strong urge.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)If Manish has specifically mentioned Gayatri mantra does he means it to be Gayatri mantra only.\n&gt; What if i have chosen some different one?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) What if growing beard is not acceptable in your working environment?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5)When you are doing your pooja or havan etc doesn&#39;t this thought ever comes to your mind :What the hell i am doing?I should go and concentrate more on my career or follow my hobby.i mean all those sort of insecurities which a common man has.Though Vimalananda has said on this but these things still ring a bell in your mind and force you to think Am i wasting my time or what?\n&gt; \n&gt; asking these questions on groups is odd,so kindly excuse me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
