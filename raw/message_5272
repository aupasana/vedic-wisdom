Now, I understand better where you com=\r\ning from!\n \n&gt; it could only be your imagination that I have any sympathies =\r\nfor him\n \nQuite possible and my apologies if so.\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;hig=\r\nhest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; This question was asked bec=\r\nause you were trying to compare apples with oranges\n \nWell, it is more like=\r\n comparing sweet apples to gross (and yet colorful) worms.\n \nAll scriptures=\r\n such as Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishads tell us that self-realization is t=\r\nhe only worthy goal of sadhana and that other abilities, siddhis and attain=\r\nments are useless and not worth pursuing. As I mentioned earlier, Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa proposed to give some siddhis to Vivekananda and the latter =\r\nrejected them because they would not help him in realizing god. Siddhis and=\r\n other abilities that come without a conscious pursuit can be accepted with=\r\n neither excitement nor regret, but they are not worth pursuing consciously=\r\n.\n \n&gt; I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me\n&gt; greater tru=\r\nth than where I am now.\n \nNo, this is not an issue of afterlife. One can do=\r\n sadhana and realize Self even when alive and then live as a jeevanmukta fl=\r\nowing with divine will.\n \nThe bottomline is that as long as ego and individ=\r\nual will are present, one is moved by the force of individual will and stuc=\r\nk in the game of actions and reactions. Once they are effaced, one flows wi=\r\nth divine will and is out of the game of actions and reactions.\n \n&gt; Bottoml=\r\nine is Sense-experience is not different from Ananda,\n&gt; and Physical body n=\r\not different from Chit.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, =\r\nin accordance with\n&gt; highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji=\r\n has done,\n&gt; because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn ab=\r\nout\n&gt; all the achievements made by all those we can know of, irrespective\n&gt;=\r\n of their being recognized as good or bad\n \nFirst of all, Ravana is NOT an =\r\nexample of the attainment of the &quot;highest ideal of Aurobindo&quot;.\n \nAurobindo&#39;=\r\ns ideals have been misunderstood by many learned people to mean that he was=\r\n striving for physical immortality. He sadly ended up attracting some wrong=\r\n people that way.\n \nIt is possible to remove the distinction between manife=\r\nsted things and Brahman and view them as non-different. But that state is n=\r\not attainable by even great yogis. Moreover, that state is not achieved by =\r\nactively pursuing it.\n \nThe best course of action for any sadhaka is to ign=\r\nore the physical form, overcome the fascination for it and its needs, reali=\r\nze the underlying Self and live as a jeevanmukta like a leaf flowing in win=\r\nd. If one is meant to divinize physical form like Mahavatar Babaji has done=\r\n, divine will will then make one to do so. But, one consciously pursuing it=\r\n is likely to retain fascination for the physical form, not realize Self an=\r\nd get nowhere.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films=\r\n that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n \n---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; One thing is clear that Ravana is not my kin, thus, i=\r\nt could only be your imagination that I have any sympathies for him or Rama=\r\n. I am amongst the general populace of the world - to me, only the greatnes=\r\ns part of the two characters have any meaning, not their faults and fallaci=\r\nes, but I don&#39;t eulogize either of them neither demean them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not a=\r\n philosopher. What I have tried to state so far, w.r.t &quot;Success with Mantra=\r\n&quot; topic, is that No matter how hard one tries, Ravanas&#39; or Ramas&#39; achieveme=\r\nnts in the field of &quot;duality&quot; cannot be erased by any amount of &quot;Highest sh=\r\nakti&quot; with or without Ego.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reason lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat-=\r\nchid-ananda as the basis of all planes of existence including Physical plan=\r\ne of existence. Argument of Impermanence by Advaitins has not so far been a=\r\nble to erase the world of duality from existence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda =\r\nis the basis of sense-mind, Chit is the basis of Physical consciousness, an=\r\nd Sat is the basis of existence of Physical plane, so lets not argue that t=\r\nhere is another reality which is better and happier than this one, and that=\r\n this world is a myth. If physical sense-experience is fleeting, it is beca=\r\nuse one has not progressed enough to realize why the truth of being is expr=\r\nessed in such a way at this plane of existence ?\n&gt; Bottomline is Sense-expe=\r\nrience is not different from Ananda, and Physical body not different from C=\r\nhit.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the field of =\r\nduality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. =\r\nThe\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?=\r\n\n&gt; This question was asked because you were trying to compare apples with o=\r\nranges, by saying that (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego c=\r\nonsciousness, presuming that they act upon each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; Truth of the mat=\r\nter is that Soul is not in competition with ego consciousness ever, because=\r\n God is never in competition with his creation !! If a liberated soul wants=\r\n to take part in an ego competition (Yada Yada hee Dharmasya), it has to ha=\r\nve an ego, however high, like that of an avatar. Krishna took the wheel of =\r\nthe chariot and tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego. Other people may=\r\n differ with me on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I see inconsistencies in your views and a bi=\r\nased and\n&gt; OTOH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than the =\r\nlast time. It is understandable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent in ever=\r\ny mind-set, because at times, it is not possible to write every little deta=\r\nil for the sake of consistency.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But the happiness one gets when one a=\r\nchieves something in the field &gt; of duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The h=\r\nighest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; which is p=\r\nermanent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Aurobindo Ghosh has clearly stated:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;...If the immortal a=\r\nnd infinite spirit has veiled itself in Matter and is emerging, the develop=\r\nment of a liberated Supramental being who shall impose in Mind, Life and Ma=\r\ntter a higher law than that of limitation and Division, is the inevitable c=\r\nonclusion from the nature of the cosmic existence. There is no reason why s=\r\nuch a being should not liberate and make Divine the physical existence as w=\r\nell as the Mind and Life....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form=\r\n, in accordance with highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji=\r\n has done, because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn abou=\r\nt all the achievements made by all those we can know of, irrespective of th=\r\neir being recognized as good or bad by a limited set of people, for a limit=\r\ned duration of time.\n&gt;\n&gt; These are just a few of my views based on what I h=\r\nave read so far, because I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife would bri=\r\nng me greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Aryama\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste Sir,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You say that &quot;Killing Ravana was not a great deed&quot; and ye=\r\nt look at &quot;binding the physical body of both Ram and Lakshman&quot; as a &quot;great =\r\ndeed&quot;. I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and sympathetic att=\r\nitutde towards Ravana and his kin. Anyway, I will just make a couple of spe=\r\ncific points on shakti, which is a subtle topic and not easy to understand.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If memory is exten=\r\nded the longest, the most fundamental and first memory should say that one =\r\nis Brahman. If one&#39;s memory extends that far, that creates the highest Shak=\r\nti! In other words, self-realization brings the highest shakti.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhat does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Grea=\r\nt question!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any lower shakti is an ability to perform actions with =\r\nobjects in the field of duality. Why does one perform actions and manipulat=\r\ne the objects in the field of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of=\r\n some kind or the other. But the happiness one gets when one achieves somet=\r\nhing in the field of duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The highest shakti g=\r\nives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda, which is permanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen one is pursuing an individual will, one may be swimming with or against=\r\n the divine will. One will have some successes and some failures, some plea=\r\nsures and some pains. When one&#39;s individual will has dropped off and one is=\r\n flowing with the rhythm of the divine will, one is in bliss no matter what=\r\n one does. One *can* do anything, but one does only what divine rhythm will=\r\ns done by one!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Only the fully detached Shiva can beget Shakti in to=\r\ntality and demons like Ravana or Mahisha or Shumbha can only get some trapp=\r\nings of Shakti but can never beget Shakti in totality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A demon like=\r\n Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a self-realized rishi. It ma=\r\ny seem like the demon has more shakti. But the rishi is in bliss whether he=\r\n is alive or being killed, whether he is at his hermitage or in prison. The=\r\n happiness demons got from their successes were short-lived and ended later=\r\n. But the rishi was in constant bliss. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was superior.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Instead, just order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do things in th=\r\ne field of duality. Just as you do not give important work to irresponsible=\r\n people, any level of shakti never goes to people who do not know how to ha=\r\nndle that level of shakti.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, if a rishi wanted, he could&#39;ve summ=\r\noned Rudra to finish off Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a rishi is in bliss=\r\n no matter what and does not break divine rhythm. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman=\r\n have to come to earth and establish certain lessons for future and take ca=\r\nre of Ravana, a rishi will let that happen and not do anything hasty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a di=\r\nfference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and killed Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kill=\r\ning Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had done that 10 times himsel=\r\nf, beheading his own head, but the shakti of his sadhana was such that he g=\r\not a new head every time to continue the sadhana. On a deeper level, it is =\r\nRudra that finally effects the death of Physical consciousness, so even tha=\r\nt part is not in the hands of a mortal Physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you =\r\nstill put Ravana above Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your understandin=\r\ng of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan=\r\n realized his shakti only after he was reminded of it. Karna, in the final =\r\nbattle, forgot his Shastra vidya because of the curse of his Guru. Generali=\r\nzing, Shakti is the ability to remember the series of actions to be done to=\r\n effect a cause lawfully, irrespective of the doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perf=\r\nect memory by birth, and not by the association with Rama. Ravana didn&#39;t ha=\r\nve perfect memory, else he would have attempted to kill Vibhishana sooner t=\r\nhan later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The use of shakti against avatar, binding the physic=\r\nal body of both Ram and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, =\r\nbecause even the motherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a=\r\n rope. Meghnaad was son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Garuda =\r\nusing divine powers, the result would have been different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Desp=\r\nite all, without Vibhishana revealing the secrets, it was impossible to kil=\r\nl Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of the field of =\r\nduality and even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in=\r\n the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and=\r\n egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; latter represents the highest shakti and Lord Ram=\r\na had it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lowe=\r\nr shakti ? Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ? In=\r\nstead, just order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Egolessness is not a shakti, but a quality of Soul consciousness, in the=\r\n same manner as Ego is a quality of Physical creation. It reveals a manner =\r\nof operating harmoniously with Nature, without creating conflicts, somethin=\r\ng that Ravana didn&#39;t know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much purity is enough an=\r\nd for what purpose ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different levels of purity can generat=\r\ne different results (and traps!),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on one&#39;s background. But th=\r\nere is no point in trying to understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it. The goal of sadhana is =\r\nto erase ego completely. It is not to erase\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some conditioning, get =\r\nsome siddhi or get some results. If some siddhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and results come, =\r\none can accept them. But one should not be thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them as a=\r\n conscious pursuit. That is a recipe for getting stucl.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vasishtha t=\r\neaches the same in Yoga Vaasishtham.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna once told =\r\nVivekananda that he would give him some siddhis he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had.

Lord Hanuman had a perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender to Rama and said=\r\n that all his power came to him due to his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devotion to Lord Rama. I=\r\nf you still put Ravana above Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your unders=\r\ntanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understan=\r\nding of the field of duality and even a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to ma=\r\nnipulate objects in the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfe=\r\nct self-control and egolessness. The latter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represents the highest =\r\nshakti and Lord Rama had it. Ravana was a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka who had a v=\r\nery high level of mastery over the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but his self-c=\r\nontrol was lacking.

It is a continuum. As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npurer and increases self-control, one may get some results. Thus, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; person still afflicted by undesirable conditioning may acquire enough\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity to get some results. But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc fell in the end!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I called &quot;purity&quot; can also b=\r\ne called &quot;self-control&quot;. Both are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nurrender of slaves is not the surrender I am talking about when I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n talk about surrender to god. The instinct of self-preservation is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; another aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may suppress pride\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; and self-importance out of no choice, for self-preservation. If one\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-preservation, one may still do so. This is conditional surrender=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is=\r\n a mess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and one is helpless may still be conditional surrender. B=\r\nut, when the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender is unconditional and one sees god as the c=\r\nontroller of all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any conditions attached, irrespective of=\r\n whether life is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one=\r\n&#39;s self-control become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A powerless p=\r\nerson may also become angry. But, as you said, his anger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is power=\r\nless to do much harm. As one&#39;s self-control increases, one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tend=\r\nency to become angry comes down. That increases one&#39;s power. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrson who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infinitely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powe=\r\nrful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum.
