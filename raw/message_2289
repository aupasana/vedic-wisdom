It\nis only after you wake up that you =\r\nsay you exist. In the dream state also,\nthe Self exists. There is really no=\r\n such thing as a dead or a living body.\nThat which does not move we call de=\r\nad, and that which has movement we call\nalive. In dreams you see any number=\r\n of bodies, living and dead, and they\nhave no existence when you wake up. I=\r\nn the same way this whole world,\nanimate and inanimate, is non-existent. De=\r\nath means the dissolution of the\nego, and birth means the rebirth of the eg=\r\no. There are births and deaths,\nbut they are of the ego; not of you. You ex=\r\nist whether the sense of ego is\nthere or not. You are its source, but not t=\r\nhe ego-sense. Deliverance (mukti)\nmeans finding the origin of these births =\r\nand deaths and demolishing the\nego-sense to its very roots. That is deliver=\r\nance. It means death with full\nawareness. If one dies thus, one is born aga=\r\nin simultaneously and in the\nsame place with Aham sphurana known as =91Aham=\r\n, Aham (I, I)=92.
