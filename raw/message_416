This fortinight comin=\r\ng just before the nava \n&gt; &gt; ratris is considered a great time to perform pi=\r\ntri tarpanas. \nThose \n&gt; &gt; who are interested in pitri tarpanas can download=\r\n a manual from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; website below and perform it. It is a very simple =\r\nprocedure and \ncan \n&gt; &gt; be finished in 5-45 min, depending on whether one d=\r\noes super-\nshort \n&gt; &gt; or short or regular procedure and how comfortable wit=\r\nh Sanskrita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of us kno=\r\nw about god and about what is good to do and \nwhat is \n&gt; &gt; bad. Still we en=\r\nd up doing, thinking and wanting wrong things on \na \n&gt; &gt; constant basis. Th=\r\ne reason is that we cannot control our mind. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; root cause of it is =\r\nthat mind is conditioned by various \ntendencies \n&gt; &gt; accumulated over vario=\r\nus karmas. It is very difficult to \novercome \n&gt; &gt; these tendencies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tarpana washes away tendencies that one got via karmik debt \nfrom \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ancestors (and others who one has a debt to) in various lives. \nHomam \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; burns away tendencies that one got because of various actions \n&gt; &gt; commi=\r\ntted by one in various lives. The mixture of one&#39;s own \nactions \n&gt; &gt; in the=\r\n past and the debts to various beings in the past creates \nthe \n&gt; &gt; set of =\r\ntendencies that condition one&#39;s mind currently. These two \n&gt; &gt; sadhanas - h=\r\nomam and tarpana - are extremely effective for \n&gt; &gt; overcoming inherent ten=\r\ndencies and make spiritual progress. \nThose \n&gt; &gt; who are interested can tak=\r\ne advantage of the easy manuals that \nwere \n&gt; &gt; created for both.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n---\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
