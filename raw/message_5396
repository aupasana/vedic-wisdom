Every living thing i=\r\ns A BEING; whether it\nbe in a Human  BEING, a Dog BEING, a Horse BEING, or =\r\nany other life form\nBEING. It means to BE  and to know it. Being exists in =\r\ntwo modes:\nEssential nature in its timeless  Ground of BEING; and in Manife=\r\nstation,\nor physical material incarnation BEING,  for a duration of Time. T=\r\nhe two\nparts are never disconnected whilst the second  part exists in Form.=\r\n \nBut when the second  part does not exist in FORM then it again returns\nto=\r\n Essence, or Essential  BEING, in the Ground of its BEING, from whence\nit i=\r\ns in its Eternal and  unchanging state of BEING. Essential BEING is\nin no n=\r\need of TIME and  CHANGE.\n\n\n\nWhilst BEING is in FORM  then it  is connected =\r\nto its Essential Timeless\nBEING by way of the BRIDGE which connects  the tw=\r\no aspects of BEING. In\nmodern vernacular the BRIDGE is called the Occult;  =\r\nor the Soul or the\nSubconscious. Meaning for the large part in its being hi=\r\ndden  from\nconsciousness. But not all the time; but whether hidden or not i=\r\nt is\nalways  working; and it is there for being used and as well as merely\n=\r\nworking.   The mode of the Essential part of BEING (the  SELF) is the\nMysti=\r\ncal.  Thus the Mystical  and the Occult are NOT the same thing. Or\nin other=\r\n words the Spirit or Life  Force of the BEING  is not the same\nthing  as th=\r\ne SOUL of the BEING. They are two things, and two of the\nthree parts of  Ma=\r\nnifest BEING. But all three parts are connected up\nwhilst Manifestation is =\r\n occurring. WE are living in a time when the\nOccult seems to be a bridge to=\r\no far,  and the Essential nature of BEING\nis two bridges too far for the cu=\r\nrrent social  paradigm. Neither science\nor religions know them, and educati=\r\non does not teach  them.\n\n\n\nBut none of this, and the above mentioned two p=\r\narts, even touches upon \nBECOMING. So, BECOMING is a third bridge too far f=\r\nor the existing\ncultural  paradigm. So why bother to delve into it or make =\r\nmention of\nit. All three  aspects are three bridges too far for the current=\r\n time;\nlet alone the last one -  BECOMING.  But in effect it is all about  =\r\nthe\ntype of cultivation of seed within being whilst modulated by freedom of=\r\n \nchoice and actions among the levels of BEING which are endowed with\nfreed=\r\nom of  choice.  That which each person choose to  sow and cultivate\nwithin =\r\nthem will then issue forth ITS fruit, and they and they  alone\nwill reap th=\r\ne harvest of that which they have sown and cultivated within\nthem, whilst i=\r\nn Manifestation; and their middle part, the BRIDGE, the \nSoul/Subconscious,=\r\n will permit of that and make it so. All for the\nlessons  of.\n\n\n\nThus, and =\r\neven though it is a waste of time mentioning any of these\nparts  and proces=\r\nses; it is still well to realise that that which you\nsow then so will  you =\r\ncome to reap the harvest of.  It is  cause and\neffect =96 not magic.   If y=\r\nou  cannot keep that to the forefront of\nyour mind, then at least keep on t=\r\nhe back  burner. The bed which you\nmake for yourself then you will sleep in=\r\n and walk  with. Until you\nchoose otherwise and take serious action upon it=\r\n. And which you  can do\nat any time. It is never too late to change course =\r\nand direction. What\ndo  you want to become in Form? Until you decide then y=\r\nou will bob\naround on the  waves of spacetime with no rudder and no wind in=\r\n your\nsail; as if in a fog in  the doldrums.
