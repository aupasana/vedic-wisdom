We =\r\nboth think that rishi is a special and sacred word applicable to a rare set=\r\n of beings and that people are using it irresponsibly now. Don&#39;t you realiz=\r\ne that it is a waste of energy for us to fight each other then?\n \nYou seem =\r\nto think that the originals drashtas (seers) to whom Vedic hymns were revea=\r\nled are rishis. That is a fine view, but has no etymological justification.=\r\n Etyomologically, the words &quot;rich&quot; (rik) and &quot;rishi&quot; are from different roo=\r\nts. Rishi is from rish. I have explained what rish means (to flow/glide smo=\r\nothly and quickly) and what rishi means. In MY view, that is the vital link=\r\n in understanding who a rishi is.\n \nBTW, Valmiki is not the rishi of any Ve=\r\ndic hymn, but he IS accepted as a maharshi. You said Narada is not a rishi.=\r\n But he IS accepted as a rishi, in fact as a devarshi (deva+rishi), i.e. a =\r\ncelestial being who flows freely with divine will with zero resistance.\n \nI=\r\n requested you so many times to stop sending personal mails in small groups=\r\n like this and discuss anything you want to discuss with me on a public for=\r\num. I will either ignore your mails or reply to them *publicly* from now on=\r\nwards.

Distinction between Muni and Rishi got blurred in Sahitya.\n\n    Ther=\r\ne is no  harm in doing study and sadhana and then preaching to others,  Tho=\r\nugh You tried to decorate your rough ideas in posts on &quot;Rishi&quot;, the vitalit=\r\ny is untouched, so, do more study and more sadhana, better do both togather=\r\n.\n     \n    Lalit. \n     \n    On Mon, Jan 3, 2011 at 3:17 AM, Lalit Mishra =\r\n&lt;mishra.lalit@...&gt; wrote:\n\n        Narsimha,\n         \n        Neithe=\r\nr you nor Manish could establish anything on Manish&#39;s connection with Guru =\r\nGorakhnath despite all such claims, You have good technical skills and have=\r\n made a software for astrologers but when you write content on sprituality =\r\nor religion, you should gain some qualification and spiritual upliftment, b=\r\nut like others, you seem to be in hurry.\n         \n        I criticizie imm=\r\nature as well as incorrect comments passed by you on mentioning of Soma as =\r\nPlant in Vedas on your post, you said - &quot;The views held by some on Soma pla=\r\nnt referred in Veda are questionable&quot;.\n         \n        http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishGroup/message/30976 \n         \n        You should have b=\r\notherd reading Vedas before passing such a remark, but you didn&#39;t, so, in o=\r\nrder to spread streak of truth, I am quoting a verse from the rikveda hopin=\r\ng you w&#39;d complete study of our dharma shastras and then w&#39;d step in commen=\r\nting anything-\n\n        !!
