I am\n=\r\n&gt;just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We &gt;should unde=\r\nrstand that we may be right but we should realize that &gt;it does not &gt;necess=\r\narily mean other person is not right.\n\nMy views are there on this subject i=\r\nn archives. I wanted to stay away but still inspired to write at least one =\r\nmessage on the same.\n\n1) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so many of r=\r\nesearches and plenty of informations available on the Internet, One will ne=\r\nver be able to come to a definitive conclusions.\n\n2) I never argue with peo=\r\nple (even when I was aggressive and passionate about the Idea of vegetarian=\r\n food) with the above basis.\nWhatever said and done, people will continue e=\r\nating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and probably Human flash as well. I h=\r\nave, with experience, understood that there is no point in arguing with peo=\r\nple giving various Data. Each side will have their own arguments, own sets =\r\nof Data and own Counter Ideas to prove their point.\n\n3) Instead I appeal th=\r\neir conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the Topic comes up, only o=\r\nne simple thing - &quot;I dont want to kill for filling up my Stomach&quot; and I say=\r\n it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on your own Throat o=\r\nr Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now realize the Plight of a=\r\n butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a...., Suffocate your=\r\nself by closing Nose & Mouth and see after only a few seconds, how you pent=\r\n for the Air and Now realize the &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish forced out of wa=\r\nter.\n\nAnd all these, because one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravin=\r\ngs of a habitual palate or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of sp=\r\nice and other food stuff but the very vital difference is that such craving=\r\n does not need killing!\n\n4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who i=\r\ns a Srilankan, has left eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of t=\r\nhe reasons for his leaving meat is because I told my views him a few times =\r\nwhen such discussions came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, =\r\nthe religion of Non-Injury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hat=\r\ns-off to him for he really seems to have thought about it and dared to chan=\r\nge his swabhava which is so very difficult.\nJust to clarify, I do not hesit=\r\nate to express my views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea =\r\nis appreciated by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are al=\r\nso taken a back with this idea. All though they know from their hearts of h=\r\nearts, it comes as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up=\r\n. Most of us are like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea=\r\n would have gone in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will=\r\n germinate.\n\n5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is good and=\r\n that side is bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to =\r\njust appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the ration=\r\nal Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and=\r\n if that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder o=\r\nf &quot;Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us who b=\r\nelieve in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.\n\nBest R=\r\negards,\n\nUtpal\n\n    \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

Please point out my mistakes I will make in this proce=\r\nss.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are trying to discuss three points here\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Choosing a diet=\r\nary habit\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on Non-veg sources of nutriti=\r\non\n&gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg food.\n&gt; \n&gt; I commented on t=\r\nwo points \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit \n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human popul=\r\nation on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n One should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attit=\r\nude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor=\r\n or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training.=\r\n and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food =\r\nunless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree w=\r\nith Narasimha Ji about this point.\n&gt; \n&gt; In some diseases Non veg sources pl=\r\nay an very important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin defi=\r\nciency two eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albu=\r\nmin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also rec=\r\nommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human populat=\r\nion on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with the link provided in =\r\nthis discussions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincin=\r\ng for switching to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book r=\r\neference which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every=\r\n information on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like a=\r\nstrology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply fa=\r\nctor. In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45=\r\n% people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied b=\r\ny Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes =\r\n(including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nu=\r\nts (include almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Mi=\r\nlk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete=\r\n source), \n&gt; \n&gt; In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their p=\r\nrice rose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not affo=\r\nrd a complete balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml =\r\nof milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per =\r\nperson, along with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quanti=\r\nties. Different sources may quote different quantities). There is average f=\r\namily size of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition =\r\nis not the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are t=\r\nhere\n&gt; \n&gt; Even at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced di=\r\net. If additional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise =\r\nanother 100% and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSir, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, =\r\neven for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you ca=\r\nn not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not=\r\n produce it yourself)\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I think and believe that practically it i=\r\ns impossible to shift all the population to veg sources especially when the=\r\n agriculture land is decreasing day by day because of many reasons)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)=\r\n Bioavailability or BV of different sources\n&gt; \n&gt; It is always a questionabl=\r\ne point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight t=\r\nhe results which support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of  halfbak=\r\ned researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for differe=\r\nnt sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal sources=\r\n are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources =\r\nare best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this)=\r\n So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. =\r\nObviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is conc=\r\nerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I agree Non v=\r\neg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetarian food=\r\n, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape from Tamas. I=\r\n agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting food, les=\r\ns energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after food, si=\r\ngnificant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy food=\r\n, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat! T=\r\nhis is true. So one should eat what one want to become.\n&gt; \n&gt; But still at l=\r\nast, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am just hig=\r\nhlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should understand tha=\r\nt we may be right but we should realise that it does not necessarily mean o=\r\nther person is not right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please point out my mistakes I had made in t=\r\nhis post. I agree that some values i mentioned here may not be exactly as q=\r\nuoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too much off the line.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; Atul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only=\r\n dealing with \n&gt; &gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had already =\r\nmaintained right at the \n&gt; &gt; beginning).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an inte=\r\nrview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several \n&gt; &gt; months b=\r\nack. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. T=\r\nhe ones \n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If=C2=A0you have any refer=\r\nences for this, in terms of whether they published any \n&gt; &gt; paper on the sa=\r\nme, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I am \n&gt; &gt; open to =\r\nlearning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. G=\r\norillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards=\r\n the development of brain. \n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing=\r\n applies to human beings or not,=C2=A0=C2=A0a \n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet=\r\n perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; This i=\r\ns a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C2=A0is concerned, because human=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain anim=\r\nal products \n&gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products. In m=\r\ny other mail, I have \n&gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books =\r\non clinical nutrition and \n&gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide mor=\r\ne; which may=C2=A0take a few days since I \n&gt; &gt; have to get them from people=\r\n who deal with these topics professionally, but time \n&gt; &gt; is not a problem.=\r\n=C2=A0All the papers are=C2=A0from the most accepted and reputed \n&gt; &gt; scien=\r\ntific=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; that=C2=A0vegeterian=C2=A0foods are=C2=A0easier to digest, if digesti=\r\nbility is the criteria. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Further, in my experience, I n=\r\never found traditional vegeterians to be any more \n&gt; &gt; dull or smarter than=\r\n traditional omnivores. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question=\r\n: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. \n&gt; &gt; If an animal can su=\r\nrvive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; fellow whatev=\r\ner he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical=C2=A0stru=\r\ncture and needs to maintain the same. But \n&gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39;=\r\n to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding \n&gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to =\r\ndogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body \n&gt; &gt; structure is =\r\ndesigned to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of \n&gt; &gt; sur=\r\nvival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nweaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may resul=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Not that a=\r\nll dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking make=\r\ns one \n&gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore m=\r\ny personal \n&gt; &gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken =\r\ncare of in the best \n&gt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe nee=\r\nded, including the right diet.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Scientists study=\r\ning evolution and human body structures have concluded that meat \n&gt; &gt; eatin=\r\ng along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nillion years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure of t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C2=A0caecum),=C2=A0and the three=\r\nfold increase in=C2=A0brain \n&gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C2=A0c=\r\nould never have been what it is today. \n&gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet=\r\n has been a=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained that it \n&gt; &gt; has changed the=\r\n very structure of the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; &gt; consciously, bu=\r\nt only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will \n&gt; &gt; prov=\r\nide relevent research=C2=A0papers to prove my claim).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; What i=\r\ns your take on this? \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me. \n&gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only =\r\nYou remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ______________________________=\r\n__\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Foo=\r\nd we eat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There has been a lo=\r\nt of discussion on food. A few quick comments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (1) We are we we ea=\r\nt. Production of various chemicals in our body and their \n&gt; &gt; interactions,=\r\n are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound \n&gt; &gt; impac=\r\nt on us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material benefits from v=\r\negetarianism. But that \n&gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reas=\r\nons as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that stro=\r\nngly identifies with the \n&gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identific=\r\nation of plants with their physical \n&gt; &gt; body is much subtler and the karma=\r\n entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \n&gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Especi=\r\nally these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by \n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nrporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for thei=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (3) =\r\nI heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) severa=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of go=\r\nrillas was \n&gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc.=\r\n After several \n&gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of =\r\nthe two sets. The ones \n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Their theor=\r\ny was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; n=\r\nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of bra=\r\nin. \n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human being=\r\ns or not, a \n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intell=\r\nectual development.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dul=\r\nl or sleepy and cannot focus well \n&gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and =\r\nskill. That is because the digestive process \n&gt; &gt; is using up a lot of ener=\r\ngy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \n&gt; &gt; agni available fo=\r\nr other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \n&gt; &gt; happen=\r\ns in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homa=\r\nm after \n&gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do s=\r\nadhana before \n&gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher dig=\r\nestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food \n&gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods th=\r\nat stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more \n&gt; &gt; frequently, agni is=\r\n diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni \n&gt; &gt; availabl=\r\ne for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, an=\r\nd fruits), \n&gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is av=\r\nailable for \n&gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experien=\r\nces.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stac=\r\nks of dry grass may \n&gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit =\r\nof internal fire may be enough \n&gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and exper=\r\niences in a person with excellent \n&gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry g=\r\nrass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaas=\r\nanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all \n&gt; &gt; depends on vaasan=\r\nas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One person may eat meat an=\r\nd deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \n&gt; &gt; them and yet make=\r\n excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik \n&gt; &gt; food, m=\r\naximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is t=\r\no ignore \n&gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being =\r\nequal, that \n&gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and the=\r\nir needs. \n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise=\r\n, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (8) One should =\r\neat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n&gt; &gt; food to =\r\nsustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n&gt; &gt; wo=\r\nrld using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food i=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most =\r\nof the time and fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; &gt; better to eat limited =\r\namount always. Regular practices are more important for \n&gt; &gt; transformation=\r\n and success, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking th=\r\nat god is the doer of all actions or considering food \n&gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s pras=\r\nad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; &gt; deeply ing=\r\nrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfeels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
