Her amazing\n&gt; life of inner visions, sp=\r\niritual yearning, surrender and bhakti inspires all\n&gt; to pursue the spiritu=\r\nal ideal, delve into the Supreme Self and not waste\n&gt; even a minute in the =\r\nprocess.\n&gt;\n&gt; Born on July 27, 1906, the child Janaky exhibited unusual deta=\r\nchment. She\n&gt; accepted all things with a joyous heart. Janaky was full of d=\r\nevotion to the\n&gt; local deities, Sri Viswanatha and Visalakshi, and as she g=\r\nrew in years,\n&gt; Janaky desired to be like Sita, the ever-faithful, pure and=\r\n holy wife of Sri\n&gt; Ram.\n&gt;\n&gt; In her thirteenth year her uncle discussed wit=\r\nh Janaky her willingness to\n&gt; marry a doctor who was then thirty-two years =\r\nof age. When told that the\n&gt; widower had two daughters, aged two and six, S=\r\nri Janaky replied, &quot;What of\n&gt; that? That doesn&#39;t make much of a difference =\r\nand, after all, I like\n&gt; children.&quot; Even though her parents were not too ke=\r\nen on this matrimonial\n&gt; arrangement because of the extreme age difference,=\r\n Janaky intuitively felt\n&gt; that the doctor would be helpful in the attainme=\r\nnt of her goal of\n&gt; Liberation. So in 1919, Sri Janaky married Dr. C. S. Ga=\r\nnapathy (known\n&gt; hereafter as &#39;Doctor&#39;), in a quiet ceremony performed befo=\r\nre Lord\n&gt; Venkataramana of Tirupathi. The Doctor was often heard to remark:=\r\n &quot;Wherever\n&gt; you (Janaky) go, I shall follow you.&quot; And where else could she=\r\n go, but to\n&gt; God? Living in Tirupathi, Sri Matha&#39;s devotion to Sri Venkata=\r\nramana grew\n&gt; steadily.\n&gt;\n&gt; In 1921, she gave birth to a daughter and named=\r\n her Padmavathy, after the\n&gt; consort of Lord Venkataramana. Then a son, Sri=\r\nnivasa Subrahmanya, was born,\n&gt; and several years later another daughter, S=\r\narada.\n&gt;\n&gt; There came a point in her life when she realized: &quot;To none but H=\r\nim (God)\n&gt; should true love be directed. To turn to the Divine is the only =\r\ntruth in\n&gt; life.&quot; From that day on she continued to take care of her family=\r\n and\n&gt; responsibilities but shifted her life&#39;s ideal to that of total devot=\r\nion to\n&gt; God.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the age of twenty her daily routine was as follows: Sh=\r\ne read the Gita\n&gt; and other Scriptures until about 1 a.m. every night. Jana=\r\nky would get up at\n&gt; 5 a.m., finish her ablutions and meditate until 7 a.m.=\r\n Then she would take a\n&gt; bath, recite hymns while attending to household wo=\r\nrk for about three hours,\n&gt; and after sending the children to school and th=\r\ne Doctor to work, she would\n&gt; engage herself heart and soul in worship unti=\r\nl 1 p.m. From 1 to 4 p.m. she\n&gt; was busy looking after the needs of her hus=\r\nband and children. At 4:30 p.m.\n&gt; she would go to the Ladies&#39; Club (which d=\r\nid much volunteer community\n&gt; service), attend meetings, play tennis and re=\r\nturn home at 7 p.m. Upon\n&gt; returning home she would meditate for an hour be=\r\nfore taking her supper of\n&gt; gruel and milk. Though she took very little foo=\r\nd, she was healthy and always\n&gt; cheerful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although the Doctor was then =\r\nearning a good salary, owing to various\n&gt; reasons, there was a lack of fund=\r\ns. One day before going to bed she prayed\n&gt; to Sri Subrahmanya to keep her =\r\ncarefree by taking on His shoulders the\n&gt; oppressive burden of the family&#39;s=\r\n welfare. The next day, a sannyasi\n&gt; (ascetic) came to her house. She was a=\r\nll alone when he said to her, &quot;You\n&gt; were calling me yesterday. I have come=\r\n from Palni. Leave to me all your\n&gt; family worries and worship me with a ca=\r\nrefree heart. Whatever is needed for\n&gt; the family - be it money or other ne=\r\neds and necessities of life - will be\n&gt; provided for.&quot; He asked her to give=\r\n him the promise that she would never\n&gt; forget him. After she agreed, he di=\r\nsappeared.\n&gt;\n&gt; After this she had many wonderful spiritual experiences and =\r\nvisions of\n&gt; deities, often lasting the whole night.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Subrahmanya ca=\r\nme twice more in the disguise of a sannyasi. When Janaky\n&gt; revealed this to=\r\n the Doctor, he replied with scepticism, &quot;I will believe\n&gt; your words only =\r\nif He comes here when I am in.&quot; Janaky responded, &quot;If that\n&gt; be your desire=\r\n, let it be so.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Doctor had just returned for lunch when they both =\r\nfelt a presence\n&gt; outside. Seeing a sannyasi, both Janaky and the Doctor ca=\r\nme out and offered\n&gt; him a chair. He took some food and said, &quot;You wanted m=\r\ne to come when your\n&gt; husband is in, and here I am.&quot; To make the Doctor bel=\r\nieve His Divinity, He\n&gt; exhibited some psychic powers. He asked for another=\r\n chair and requested\n&gt; Janaky to be seated. She felt reluctant to sit on th=\r\ne same level with Him,\n&gt; but he insisted and asked her what more she desire=\r\nd. Janaky requested Him to\n&gt; bless her with a Sadguru in human form.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wh=\r\nat the sannyasi next said to her shocked her very much. &quot;I am none none\n&gt; o=\r\nther Subrahmanya. Much pleased by your meritorious actions and depth of\n&gt; d=\r\nevotion, I have a longing to be born as a child to you. I will play with\n&gt; =\r\nyou for two years and then my power will get infused in your heart.&quot; Janaky=\r\n\n&gt; exclaimed, &quot;My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of samsar=\r\na\n&gt; (worldliness) when my desire is to ferry across it.&quot; She argued that sh=\r\ne\n&gt; would not be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was on =\r\nfire\n&gt; with renunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and p=\r\nunished\n&gt; him? What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck =\r\nand call;\n&gt; she would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to p=\r\nsychic powers\n&gt; and fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begg=\r\ned, &quot;Let me be\n&gt; blessed with a Guru.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With a smile of His face, Subrah=\r\nmanya said, &quot;Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if\n&gt; such be your wish, there is a=\r\n Mahatma by name Sri Ramana Maharshi in\n&gt; Tiruvannamalai. You may go and ha=\r\nve His darshan.&quot; He showed Janaky a photo\n&gt; of Bhagavan Ramana that he was =\r\ncarrying. It was the first time that she had\n&gt; heard about Bhagavan Sri Ram=\r\nana. Saying that he would come again to discuss\n&gt; with her His desire to be=\r\n born as her child, He disappeared from sight.\n&gt;\n&gt; Her heart then surged wi=\r\nth an intense love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana. She\n&gt; continued with her medita=\r\ntions, worship, household chores and volunteer\n&gt; work. Day by day, Janaky c=\r\nould feel a number of changes happening to her\n&gt; nervous system. Her vision=\r\ns continued. A severe pain developed in her spine\n&gt; and she became bedridde=\r\nn. Her nerves seemed to have been shattered and often\n&gt; the heartbeat was f=\r\naint and hardly audible. In spite of all this, her mind\n&gt; remained peaceful=\r\n. Friends wanted her to be seen by specialists, but the\n&gt; Doctor was sure i=\r\nt was not a disease to be treated medically and that, by\n&gt; the grace of God=\r\n, she would be all right. This state continued for forty\n&gt; days and then di=\r\nsappeared as mysteriously as it came.\n&gt;\n&gt; After a few days, a sadhu appeare=\r\nd before her and again asked about\n&gt; Subrahmanya being born to her. Again s=\r\nhe pleaded that she didn&#39;t need\n&gt; obstacles, but a helping hand. The sadhu =\r\nassured her that, &quot;Begetting a son\n&gt; will in no way shackle you in bondage.=\r\n There will be no hindrances to your\n&gt; spiritual progress.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Janaky and =\r\nthe Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. Her long\n&gt; cherished=\r\n yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitting in the\n&gt; medit=\r\nation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and gracious\n&gt; loo=\r\nk of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated with the\n&gt; nec=\r\ntar flowing through Bhagavan&#39;s eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be seated. Her\n&gt;=\r\n heart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flow of\n&gt; Bh=\r\nagavan&#39;s Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagavan\n&gt; ble=\r\nssing her.\n&gt;\n&gt; To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the formless Aruna=\r\nchaleswara. In\n&gt; the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky knelt bef=\r\nore Bhagavan and\n&gt; spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri Subrah=\r\nmanya&#39;s decision to\n&gt; incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her experien=\r\nce of the all-pervasive\n&gt; nature of the Paramatma and awaited instructions =\r\nfrom Bhagavan as to what\n&gt; she should do next. He said, &quot;Continue doing it =\r\nin just the same way.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With the infant Swaminathan, Janaky and the Doct=\r\nor returned to Sri\n&gt; Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bhagavan in August 1=\r\n936. For a long time\n&gt; Janaky had been praying for her husband&#39;s spiritual =\r\nawareness to be aroused\n&gt; so that he might not, at any time, stand in the w=\r\nay of her spiritual\n&gt; progress. Bhagavan asked both the Doctor and Janaky t=\r\no come before him and\n&gt; he read aloud &quot;Upadesa Saram&quot; (Essence of Instructi=\r\non) and asked them to\n&gt; follow it. Janaky&#39;s heart was overflowing with joy.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; To quote from Janaky Matha&#39;s biography:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;.From the moment she firs=\r\nt came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana, He was her all.\n&gt; She reasoned, &#39;There is on=\r\nly one thing in the world worth achieving: the\n&gt; root cause of the whole un=\r\niverse, the &#39;One Without a Second&#39;. I must attain\n&gt; it, realize it and expe=\r\nrience it with Bhagavan&#39;s Grace.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Physically and mentally drained by he=\r\nr spiritual experiences, Janaky sought\n&gt; Bhagavan&#39;s help in October 1936. A=\r\nt an opportune moment, she prostrated\n&gt; before Bhagavan and poured out her =\r\nheart to him. She told of her spiritual\n&gt; experiences and begged for his pr=\r\notection and the removal of obstacles in\n&gt; her quest for Liberation. She al=\r\nso expressed her fear of becoming deranged\n&gt; because she had no Guru to gui=\r\nde her. Bhagavan replied: &quot;Who told you that\n&gt; you have no Guru? Don&#39;t get =\r\ndisheartened. I am here as your Guru; nothing\n&gt; will upset your mind.&quot; With=\r\n that assurance, she transferred all her cares\n&gt; and worries to Bhagavan Ra=\r\nmana.\n&gt;\n&gt; About a year later, Janaky felt something like a forceful explosi=\r\non at the\n&gt; back of her head and powerful currents throughout her spinal co=\r\nrd. She did\n&gt; not think her physical body could withstand it. She said to h=\r\nerself, &#39;Let\n&gt; things take their own course. The grace of the Guru will do =\r\nwhat is right\n&gt; and good for me.&#39; This state continued for twenty-six days =\r\nafter which she\n&gt; asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam. He was =\r\nreluctant at first\n&gt; due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself to be=\r\n persuaded. Sri\n&gt; Bhagavan&#39;s full glance of grace poured forth blessings an=\r\nd strength on her.\n&gt; Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her experi=\r\nences, he spoke to her\n&gt; about a similar experience he had had in his early=\r\n days: &quot;Look here. Don&#39;t\n&gt; get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed=\r\n I felt as if I had been\n&gt; bombed from inside at the back of my head.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThe young Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said to\n&gt; Ja=\r\nnaky in a sweet, childish voice, &quot;Mother, see here! That Bhagavan we saw\n&gt; =\r\nthere in Tiruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you whereve=\r\nr\n&gt; you go.&quot; These words were a source of great consolation and joy as Jana=\r\nky\n&gt; continued to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was January=\r\n of 1938 when Janaky&#39;s body became rigid from her toes\n&gt; upward. She though=\r\nt she was nearing her end. Her mind withdrew into Sri\n&gt; Ramana in the heart=\r\n. She had many visions and experiences, but the one that\n&gt; crowned all othe=\r\nrs was the experience of the dynamic force or Sakti\n&gt; ascending and embraci=\r\nng the Supreme Self. The kundalini continued to push\n&gt; upwards and tried to=\r\n break through the spot in the top of her head. Janaky\n&gt; cried out, &quot;What a=\r\nre you trying to do? Bhagavan Sri Ramana and I are\n&gt; inseparable! Against t=\r\nhe downpour of the Guru&#39;s Grace, you can do me no\n&gt; harm.&quot; With this, the f=\r\norce stopped its attempts and bodily feeling\n&gt; returned. She told the Docto=\r\nr that she had at last been set free from the\n&gt; rounds of birth and death a=\r\nnd had attained her long cherished goal. The\n&gt; purpose of her earthly life =\r\nwas fulfilled. By the grace of Bhagavan Sri\n&gt; Ramana, Janaky became a Jivan=\r\nmukta (liberated soul) at thirty-two years of\n&gt; age.\n&gt;\n&gt; Janaky had travell=\r\ned between Ramanasramam and her home whenever she felt\n&gt; the need to be nea=\r\nr Bhagavan, but on January 18, 1938, while visiting\n&gt; Ramanasramam, she did=\r\n not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor was\n&gt; upset and felt as if=\r\n he had now lost his second wife. The younger children\n&gt; were grief-stricke=\r\nn. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she was\n&gt; revelling in a=\r\n glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she\n&gt; remembered the pro=\r\nmise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for\n&gt; five more years=\r\n. She immediately said she would go back with them to\n&gt; Kakinada. Bhagavan =\r\ngazed at her and said, &quot;Did I ask you to become a\n&gt; sannyasini? Look at me.=\r\n I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre\n&gt; cloth. You have only=\r\n one family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all\n&gt; these devotees and =\r\ntheir families.&quot; She knew then that renunciation must be\n&gt; in the heart.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many visions and\n&gt; exper=\r\niences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle of birth and\n&gt; de=\r\nath. Bhagavan gently said, &quot;Can one get this for the mere asking? It seeks\n=\r\n&gt; the heart where it wants to shine.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As the Doctor and Janaky were pre=\r\nparing to leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor,\n&gt; &quot;You doctors say that the hear=\r\nt is at the left side of the chest. But the\n&gt; whole body is the heart for y=\r\nogis. Jnanis have their hearts both within and\n&gt; without.&quot; He then gazed at=\r\n Janaky and again assured her: &quot;I am always with\n&gt; you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bhagavan was h=\r\ner All. She desired only to contemplate the Holy Feet of\n&gt; Bhagavan. In the=\r\n months and years that followed, devotees were drawn to\n&gt; Janaky as bees to=\r\n honey. She began to be addressed as Sri Matha. She took a\n&gt; few of them to=\r\n Sri Ramanasramam and said to Bhagavan, &quot;All these people seek\n&gt; me as thei=\r\nr Guru.I have never wished to be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan,\n&gt; in all=\r\n humility, to kindly accept these devotees as Bhagavan&#39;s disciples.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bh=\r\nagavan said, &quot;When you are above likes and dislikes, desires and\n&gt; aversion=\r\ns, let things take their own shape. To the extent they believe in\n&gt; you, th=\r\ney will reap results. I will protect those who, with full faith,\n&gt; trust in=\r\n you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Another incident that happened at Ramanasramam occurred when an =\r\noil lamp\n&gt; went out and the hall was in darkness for a few minutes. When th=\r\ne light came\n&gt; back, three-year-old Swaminathan exclaimed, &quot;The light faile=\r\nd and Bhagavan\n&gt; was not visible; the light came back and Bhagavan is seen!=\r\n&quot; Bhagavan turned\n&gt; to the boy and said, &quot;What you say is precisely correct=\r\n. When there is\n&gt; ajnana (ignorance), God is not realized. With the dawn of=\r\n jnana (wisdom), He\n&gt; is seen.&quot; As it was Bhagavan who gave Sri Matha her l=\r\night of wisdom, she\n&gt; decided to pay for the electrification of the Ashram.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Even after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her domestic and soc=\r\nial\n&gt; activities. She was elected President of the Child Welfare Centre and=\r\n Vice\n&gt; President of the Ladies&#39; Club. She performed all her actions for Go=\r\nd&#39;s sake\n&gt; in a supremely detached manner. With equanimity of mind, she saw=\r\n the Lord in\n&gt; all of the world.\n&gt;\n&gt; To some people she would advise, &quot;Lead=\r\n a righteous life and discharge your\n&gt; duties to the family, conduct family=\r\n worship, practise charity, have an\n&gt; abundant life and learn to gradually =\r\nstill the waves of passion.&quot; To others\n&gt; who wanted to know more about Libe=\r\nration, she taught, &quot;Always nurture Divine\n&gt; thoughts, obliterate likes and=\r\n passions and surrender to the Guru.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There were times when Sri Matha w=\r\nas lost in samadhi, oblivious to her\n&gt; surroundings. Food had to be forced =\r\ninto her mouth for sustenance and she\n&gt; had to be bathed by others, as she =\r\nwas oblivious of her body. At other times\n&gt; she attended to her routine wor=\r\nk and concealed her exalted state.\n&gt;\n&gt; After the marriage of her daughter, =\r\nSarada, Sri Matha was making final\n&gt; arrangements for a permanent stay at S=\r\nri Ramanasramam. After bowing before\n&gt; Bhagavan, the ten-year-old Swaminath=\r\nan poured out his sorrow, weeping\n&gt; bitterly and rolling on the ground. He =\r\nsobbed, &quot;Pray give us back my mother\n&gt; and order her to come with us to Tha=\r\nnjavur.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bhagavan, with a voice choked with emotion said to Sri Matha, =\r\n&quot;What can I\n&gt; do?&quot; Then turning to Swaminathan said affectionately, &quot;Take y=\r\nour mother and\n&gt; go back to Thanjavur.&quot; Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan&#39;s r=\r\nequest and\n&gt; returned with the Doctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old R=\r\namachandran.\n&gt;\n&gt; At Sri Matha&#39;s request the southern portion of the family =\r\nhouse remain as\n&gt; an ashram and spiritual centre with Sri Bhagavan as the S=\r\nadguru. The main\n&gt; objective of the centre is to spread the teachings of Bh=\r\nagavan Ramana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Moments before her passing away, in April 1969, devotees=\r\n and relatives\n&gt; chanted Bhagavan&#39;s hymn Aksharamanamalai, with the refrain=\r\n of &quot;Arunachala\n&gt; Shiva, Arunachala Shiva.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Matha&#39;s life stands as =\r\na shining example of perseverance to the ideal\n&gt; of Liberation and devotion=\r\n to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her\n&gt; devotees were having a length=\r\ny discussion of Bhagavan&#39;s &#39;Who am I?&#39; enquiry,\n&gt; she halted them saying, &quot;=\r\nEnough of this discussion! My head begins to swim\n&gt; with such dry and usele=\r\nss discussions. Amma knows only one thing - to show\n&gt; devotion to Sri Bhaga=\r\nvan.&quot; It was through such steadfast devotion that Sri\n&gt; Matha achieved Libe=\r\nration.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of the fact that =\r\nhe is not\n&gt; the body. But there is one thing more. Unless one looks upon de=\r\nath as a\n&gt; thing that is very near and might happen at any moment, one will=\r\n not be\n&gt; aware of the Self. This means that the ego must die, must vanish,=\r\n along with\n&gt; the inherent vasanas.&quot; - Letters from Sri Ramanasramam\n&gt;\n&gt; So=\r\nurce: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2006/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; =E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd5c0809e88f4047b7b6eb1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Prasanth Jalasutram,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Really a very good article.

Swaminathan=\r\n&#39;s Biography of Guru Devi Sri Janaky Matha for source material. July 27=\r\nth is Janaky Matha&#39;s one hundredth birth anniversary.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sri Jan=\r\naky Matha was a wife, mother of seven children, community volunteer, devote=\r\ne of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi and an enlightened soul. Her amazing life of =\r\ninner visions, spiritual yearning, surrender and bhakti inspires all to pur=\r\nsue the spiritual ideal, delve into the Supreme Self and not waste even a m=\r\ninute in the process.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Born on July 27, 1906, the child Janaky exh=\r\nibited unusual detachment. She accepted all things with a joyous heart. Jan=\r\naky was full of devotion to the local deities, Sri Viswanatha and Visalaksh=\r\ni, and as she grew in years, Janaky desired to be like Sita, the ever-faith=\r\nful, pure and holy wife of Sri Ram.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;In her thirteenth year her un=\r\ncle discussed with Janaky her willingness to marry a doctor who was then th=\r\nirty-two years of age. When told that the widower had two daughters, aged t=\r\nwo and six, Sri Janaky replied, &quot;What of that? That doesn&#39;t make m=\r\nuch of a difference and, after all, I like children.&quot; Even though her =\r\nparents were not too keen on this matrimonial arrangement because of the ex=\r\ntreme age difference, Janaky intuitively felt that the doctor would be help=\r\nful in the attainment of her goal of Liberation. So in 1919, Sri Janaky mar=\r\nried Dr. C. S. Ganapathy (known hereafter as &#39;Doctor&#39;), in a quiet =\r\nceremony performed before Lord Venkataramana of Tirupathi. The Doctor was o=\r\nften heard to remark: &quot;Wherever you (Janaky) go, I shall follow you.&q=\r\nuot; And where else could she go, but to God? Living in Tirupathi, Sri Math=\r\na&#39;s devotion to Sri Venkataramana grew steadily.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;In 1921, she=\r\n gave birth to a daughter and named her Padmavathy, after the consort of Lo=\r\nrd Venkataramana. Then a son, Srinivasa Subrahmanya, was born, and several =\r\nyears later another daughter, Sarada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There came a point in her life=\r\n when she realized: &quot;To none but Him (God) should true love be directe=\r\nd. To turn to the Divine is the only truth in life.&quot; From that day on =\r\nshe continued to take care of her family and responsibilities but shifted h=\r\ner life&#39;s ideal to that of total devotion to God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At the age of twenty her daily routine was as follows=\r\n: She read the Gita and other Scriptures until about 1 a.m. every night. Ja=\r\nnaky would get up at 5 a.m., finish her ablutions and meditate until 7 a.m.=\r\n Then she would take a bath, recite hymns while attending to household work=\r\n for about three hours, and after sending the children to school and the Do=\r\nctor to work, she would engage herself heart and soul in worship until 1 p.=\r\nm. From 1 to 4 p.m. she was busy looking after the needs of her husband and=\r\n children. At 4:30 p.m. she would go to the Ladies&#39; Club (which did muc=\r\nh volunteer community service), attend meetings, play tennis and return hom=\r\ne at 7 p.m. Upon returning home she would meditate for an hour before takin=\r\ng her supper of gruel and milk. Though she took very little food, she was h=\r\nealthy and always cheerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Although the Doctor was then e=\r\narning a good salary, owing to various reasons, there was a lack of funds. =\r\nOne day before going to bed she prayed to Sri Subrahmanya to keep her caref=\r\nree by taking on His shoulders the oppressive burden of the family&#39;s we=\r\nlfare. The next day, a sannyasi (ascetic) came to her house. She was all al=\r\none when he said to her, &quot;You were calling me yesterday. I have come f=\r\nrom Palni. Leave to me all your family worries and worship me with a carefr=\r\nee heart. Whatever is needed for the family - be it money or other needs an=\r\nd necessities of life - will be provided for.&quot; He asked her to give hi=\r\nm the promise that she would never forget him. After she agreed, he disappe=\r\nared.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;After this she had many wonderful spiritual experiences and=\r\n visions of deities, often lasting the whole night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Subrahmanya =\r\ncame twice more in the disguise of a sannyasi. When Janaky revealed this to=\r\n the Doctor, he replied with scepticism, &quot;I will believe your words on=\r\nly if He comes here when I am in.&quot; Janaky responded, &quot;If that be =\r\nyour desire, let it be so.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Doctor had just returned for=\r\n lunch when they both felt a presence outside. Seeing a sannyasi, both Jana=\r\nky and the Doctor came out and offered him a chair. He took some food and s=\r\naid, &quot;You wanted me to come when your husband is in, and here I am.&qu=\r\not; To make the Doctor believe His Divinity, He exhibited some psychic powe=\r\nrs. He asked for another chair and requested Janaky to be seated. She felt =\r\nreluctant to sit on the same level with Him, but he insisted and asked her =\r\nwhat more she desired. Janaky requested Him to bless her with a Sadguru in =\r\nhuman form.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;What the sannyasi ne=\r\nxt said to her shocked her very much. &quot;I am none none other Subrahmany=\r\na. Much pleased by your meritorious actions and depth of devotion, I have a=\r\n longing to be born as a child to you. I will play with you for two years a=\r\nnd then my power will get infused in your heart.&quot; Janaky exclaimed, &q=\r\nuot;My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of samsara (worldlin=\r\ness) when my desire is to ferry across it.&quot; She argued that she would =\r\nnot be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was on fire with =\r\nrenunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and punished him?=\r\n What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck and call; she =\r\nwould be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psychic powers an=\r\nd fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, &quot;Let me b=\r\ne blessed with a Guru.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;With a smile of His face, Sub=\r\nrahmanya said, &quot;Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if such be your wish, ther=\r\ne is a Mahatma by name Sri Ramana Maharshi in Tiruvannamalai. You may go an=\r\nd have His darshan.&quot; He showed Janaky a photo of Bhagavan Ramana that =\r\nhe was carrying. It was the first time that she had heard about Bhagavan Sr=\r\ni Ramana. Saying that he would come again to discuss with her His desire to=\r\n be born as her child, He disappeared from sight.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Her heart then =\r\nsurged with an intense love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana. She continued with her=\r\n meditations, worship, household chores and volunteer work. Day by day, Jan=\r\naky could feel a number of changes happening to her nervous system. Her vis=\r\nions continued. A severe pain developed in her spine and she became bedridd=\r\nen. Her nerves seemed to have been shattered and often the heartbeat was fa=\r\nint and hardly audible. In spite of all this, her mind remained peaceful. F=\r\nriends wanted her to be seen by specialists, but the Doctor was sure it was=\r\n not a disease to be treated medically and that, by the grace of God, she w=\r\nould be all right. This state continued for forty days and then disappeared=\r\n as mysteriously as it came.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;After a few days, a sadhu appeared b=\r\nefore her and again asked about Subrahmanya being born to her. Again she pl=\r\neaded that she didn&#39;t need obstacles, but a helping hand. The sadhu ass=\r\nured her that, &quot;Begetting a son will in no way shackle you in bondage.=\r\n There will be no hindrances to your spiritual progress.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ja=\r\nnaky and the Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. Her long ch=\r\nerished yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitting in the =\r\nmeditation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and gracious =\r\nlook of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated with the ne=\r\nctar flowing through Bhagavan&#39;s eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be seated. =\r\nHer heart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flow of B=\r\nhagavan&#39;s Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagavan =\r\nblessing her.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the forml=\r\ness Arunachaleswara. In the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky kn=\r\nelt before Bhagavan and spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri S=\r\nubrahmanya&#39;s decision to incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her e=\r\nxperience of the all-pervasive nature of the Paramatma and awaited instruct=\r\nions from Bhagavan as to what she should do next. He said, &quot;Continue d=\r\noing it in just the same way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;With the infant Swaminathan, =\r\nJanaky and the Doctor returned to Sri Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bha=\r\ngavan in August 1936. For a long time Janaky had been praying for her husba=\r\nnd&#39;s spiritual awareness to be aroused so that he might not, at any tim=\r\ne, stand in the way of her spiritual progress. Bhagavan asked both the Doct=\r\nor and Janaky to come before him and he read aloud &quot;Upadesa Saram&quot=\r\n; (Essence of Instruction) and asked them to follow it. Janaky&#39;s heart =\r\nwas overflowing with joy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;To quote from Janaky Matha&#39;s biogra=\r\nphy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;.From the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana, H=\r\ne was her all. She reasoned, &#39;There is only one thing in the world wort=\r\nh achieving: the root cause of the whole universe, the &#39;One Without a S=\r\necond&#39;. I must attain it, realize it and experience it with Bhagavan&#3=\r\n9;s Grace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Physically and mentally drained by her spiritual=\r\n experiences, Janaky sought Bhagavan&#39;s help in October 1936. At an oppo=\r\nrtune moment, she prostrated before Bhagavan and poured out her heart to hi=\r\nm. She told of her spiritual experiences and begged for his protection and =\r\nthe removal of obstacles in her quest for Liberation. She also expressed he=\r\nr fear of becoming deranged because she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan =\r\nreplied: &quot;Who told you that you have no Guru? Don&#39;t get dishearten=\r\ned. I am here as your Guru; nothing will upset your mind.&quot; With that a=\r\nssurance, she transferred all her cares and worries to Bhagavan Ramana.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;About a year later, Janaky felt something like a forceful explosion =\r\nat the back of her head and powerful currents throughout her spinal cord. S=\r\nhe did not think her physical body could withstand it. She said to herself,=\r\n &#39;Let things take their own course. The grace of the Guru will do what =\r\nis right and good for me.&#39; This state continued for twenty-six days aft=\r\ner which she asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam. He was reluc=\r\ntant at first due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself to be persua=\r\nded. Sri Bhagavan&#39;s full glance of grace poured forth blessings and str=\r\nength on her. Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her experiences, =\r\nhe spoke to her about a similar experience he had had in his early days: &q=\r\nuot;Look here. Don&#39;t get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed I=\r\n felt as if I had been bombed from inside at the back of my head.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The young Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said =\r\nto Janaky in a sweet, childish voice, &quot;Mother, see here! That Bhagavan=\r\n we saw there in Tiruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you=\r\n wherever you go.&quot; These words were a source of great consolation and =\r\njoy as Janaky continued to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;It was January of 1938 when Janaky&#39;s body became rigid from her toes u=\r\npward. She thought she was nearing her end. Her mind withdrew into Sri Rama=\r\nna in the heart. She had many visions and experiences, but the one that cro=\r\nwned all others was the experience of the dynamic force or Sakti ascending =\r\nand embracing the Supreme Self. The kundalini continued to push upwards and=\r\n tried to break through the spot in the top of her head. Janaky cried out, =\r\n&quot;What are you trying to do? Bhagavan Sri Ramana and I are inseparable!=\r\n Against the downpour of the Guru&#39;s Grace, you can do me no harm.&quot;=\r\n With this, the force stopped its attempts and bodily feeling returned. She=\r\n told the Doctor that she had at last been set free from the rounds of birt=\r\nh and death and had attained her long cherished goal. The purpose of her ea=\r\nrthly life was fulfilled.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;By the grac=\r\ne of Bhagavan Sri Ramana, Janaky became a Jivanmukta (liberated soul) at th=\r\nirty-two years of age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Janaky had travelled between Ramana=\r\nsramam and her home whenever she felt the need to be near Bhagavan,=C2=A0&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;but on January 18, 1938, while visiting Rama=\r\nnasramam, she did not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor was upset=\r\n and felt as if he had now lost his second wife. The younger children were =\r\ngrief-stricken. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she was rev=\r\nelling in a glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she remembere=\r\nd the promise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for five mor=\r\ne years. She immediately said she would go back with them to Kakinada. Bhag=\r\navan gazed at her and said, &quot;Did I ask you to become a sannyasini? Loo=\r\nk at me. I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre cloth. You hav=\r\ne only one family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all these devotees =\r\nand their families.&quot; She knew then that renunciation must be in the he=\r\nart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many=\r\n visions and experiences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle=\r\n of birth and death. Bhagavan gently said, &quot;Can one get this for the m=\r\nere asking? It seeks the heart where it wants to shine.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;As =\r\nthe Doctor and Janaky were preparing to leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor, &q=\r\nuot;You doctors say that the heart is at the left side of the chest. But th=\r\ne whole body is the heart for yogis. Jnanis have their hearts both within a=\r\nnd without.&quot; He then gazed at Janaky and again assured her: &quot;I am=\r\n always with you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was her All. She desired only to=\r\n contemplate the Holy Feet of Bhagavan.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ital=\r\nic&quot;&gt;In the months and years that followed, devotees were drawn to Janaky as=\r\n bees to honey. She began to be addressed as Sri Matha. She took a few of t=\r\nhem to Sri Ramanasramam and said to Bhagavan, &quot;All these people seek m=\r\ne as their Guru.I have never wished to be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan,=\r\n in all humility, to kindly accept these devotees as Bhagavan&#39;s discipl=\r\nes.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan said, &quot;When you are above likes and disli=\r\nkes, desires and aversions, let things take their own shape. To the extent =\r\nthey believe in you, they will reap results. I will protect those who, with=\r\n full faith, trust in you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;Another incident that happened at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil=\r\n lamp went out and the hall was in darkness for a few minutes. When the lig=\r\nht came back, three-year-old Swaminathan exclaimed, &quot;The light failed =\r\nand Bhagavan was not visible; the light came back and Bhagavan is seen!&quo=\r\nt; Bhagavan turned to the boy and said, &quot;What you say is precisely cor=\r\nrect. When there is ajnana (ignorance), God is not realized. With the dawn =\r\nof jnana (wisdom), He is seen.&quot; As it was Bhagavan who gave Sri Matha =\r\nher light of wisdom, she decided to pay for the electrification of the Ashr=\r\nam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her =\r\ndomestic and social activities. She was elected President of the Child Welf=\r\nare Centre and Vice President of the Ladies&#39; Club. She performed all he=\r\nr actions for God&#39;s sake in a supremely detached manner. With equanimit=\r\ny of mind, she saw the Lord in all of the world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To some people she would advise, &quot;Lead a righteous li=\r\nfe and discharge your duties to the family, conduct family worship, practis=\r\ne charity, have an abundant life and learn to gradually still the waves of =\r\npassion.&quot; To others who wanted to know more about Liberation, she taug=\r\nht, &quot;Always nurture Divine thoughts, obliterate likes and passions and=\r\n surrender to the Guru.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;There were times when Sri Ma=\r\ntha was lost in samadhi, oblivious to her surroundings. Food had to be forc=\r\ned into her mouth for sustenance and she had to be bathed by others, as she=\r\n was oblivious of her body. At other times she attended to her routine work=\r\n and concealed her exalted state.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:itali=\r\nc&quot;&gt;After the marriage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Matha was making final a=\r\nrrangements for a permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam. After bowing before B=\r\nhagavan, the ten-year-old Swaminathan poured out his sorrow, weeping bitter=\r\nly and rolling on the ground. He sobbed, &quot;Pray give us back my mother =\r\nand order her to come with us to Thanjavur.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan, with =\r\na voice choked with emotion said to Sri Matha, &quot;What can I do?&quot; T=\r\nhen turning to Swaminathan said affectionately, &quot;Take your mother and =\r\ngo back to Thanjavur.&quot; Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan&#39;s request a=\r\nnd returned with the Doctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandra=\r\nn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At Sri Matha&#39;s req=\r\nuest the southern portion of the family house remain as an ashram and spiri=\r\ntual centre with Sri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main objective of the cen=\r\ntre is to spread the teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Moments=\r\n before her passing away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives chanted Bha=\r\ngavan&#39;s hymn Aksharamanamalai, with the refrain of &quot;Arunachala Shi=\r\nva, Arunachala Shiva.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Sri Ma=\r\ntha&#39;s life stands as a shining example of perseverance to the ideal of =\r\nLiberation and devotion to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her devotees=\r\n were having a lengthy discussion of Bhagavan&#39;s &#39;Who am I?&#39; enq=\r\nuiry, she halted them saying, &quot;Enough of this discussion! My head begi=\r\nns to swim with such dry and useless discussions. Amma knows only one thing=\r\n - to show devotion to Sri Bhagavan.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0It was through such =\r\nsteadfast devotion that Sri Matha achieved Liberation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&quot;A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware o=\r\nf the fact that he is not the body. But there is one thing more. Unless one=\r\n looks upon death as a thing that is very near and might happen at any mome=\r\nnt, one will not be aware of the Self.
