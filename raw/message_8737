If one walks too fast, one will fall. Similarly, to one seekin=\r\ng to walk on the tight rope of enlightened/detached action, focus and stead=\r\niness are far more important than speed. If one walks too fast, one will fa=\r\nll (develop attachment to actions or fruits).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Spiritual progre=\r\nss by definition is the process of slowing down unneeded mental activity an=\r\nd focus on &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-10&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;one&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D=\r\n&quot;misspell-11&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;dharma&lt;/span&gt; with as little attachment as pos=\r\nsible. The notion of making &quot;fast&quot; spiritual progress introduces unneeded m=\r\nental activity and spoils focus.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;A\n somewhat related point:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t make the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-12&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhana&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; you do into a rat race or even a mindless ritual.

Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-27&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;judgement&lt;/span&gt; is to objectively see what=\r\n changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are=\r\n we less angry, more &lt;span\n id=3D&quot;misspell-28&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;equanimous&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;, etc etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds e=\r\ntc etc - is VAST. Some of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a=\r\n complex study in itself. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth tr=\r\nying to &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-29&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;analyse&lt;/span&gt; and understa=\r\nnd these\n things properly, but some pattern is observable.&nbsp; Not all ex=\r\nperiences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this=\r\n jungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is gen=\r\nuine and which is non-genuine. This is the world of&nbsp; astral plane, dri=\r\nven by the overlapping &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-30&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;shealths&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt; of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-31&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pranamayakosha&lt;/span&gt; and pa=\r\nrts of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-32&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;manomayakosha&lt;/span&gt; of a hu=\r\nman being. In &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-33&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Tantrik&lt;/span&gt; termin=\r\nology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlapping and not di=\r\nscreet) of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-34&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;swadhisthana&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;misspell-35&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;anahata&lt;/span&gt;. Everything&nbsp; is =\r\npossible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation =\r\nin this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings o=\r\nf varies character and hue\n who can very easily create an &lt;span id=3D&quot;missp=\r\nell-36&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;expereince&lt;/span&gt; for a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-37&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhaka&lt;/span&gt; to delude him/her off the path. They can even fa=\r\nke an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of=\r\n a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, =\r\nthe\n lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of=\r\n a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscio=\r\nus ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) =\r\netc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if&nbsp; properly &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-38&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;channalized&lt;/span&gt; as is done in genuine &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;misspell-39&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Vaishava&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-=\r\n40&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Bhakti&lt;/span&gt;, it can make one experience Divine &lt;span i=\r\nd=3D&quot;misspell-41&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ananda&lt;/span&gt; and manifest the &quot;&lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-42&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;antaratmah&lt;/span&gt;&quot; as an unfailing guide to=\r\n the path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authen=\r\ntic only to the extent that it helps to modify and transform your waking su=\r\nrface personality. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of experi=\r\nences that come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ON=\r\nLY from this realm,\n are just sound and fury without substance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In =\r\nthe writings of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-43&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-44&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aurobindo&lt;/span&gt;, he calls it the intermedi=\r\nate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away by =\r\nthe light and sound of this\n realm.

However, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspe=\r\nll-59&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Optimised&lt;/span&gt; &quot;controlled&quot; speed (even if very fas=\r\nt by set standards) could be an added advantage while not loosing the sight=\r\n of the road. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best\n Regards, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-60&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Utpal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;&lt;span =\r\nid=3D&quot;misspell-61&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;rajarshi&lt;/span&gt;14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;=\r\n wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Got an &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-62&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sm=\r\ns&lt;/span&gt; from a good friend today. Thought I will share it here. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &quot;Progress has little to do with speed; but much to do with directio=\r\nn. So always concentrate on your direction, not on speed.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; For any genuine spiritual seeker, this is one of the sanest advices, ever=\r\n. In the milieu of spirituality, too many people get caught up in the less =\r\nimportant - aka, visions, &#39;experiences&#39;, tough-penances, complex rituals, o=\r\nffbeat &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-63&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhanas&lt;/span&gt; etc etc, whi=\r\nle forgetting the goal of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind=\r\n/emotions/body resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equani=\r\nmity to life situations, an abiding\n calm and peace, genuine humility, less=\r\nening of lower emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furi=\r\nous attachments, such that eventually every action of the\n individual is li=\r\nke a consecration (sacrifice, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-64&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;yagjy=\r\na&lt;/span&gt;) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so away from our average=\r\n superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God is no=\r\nt the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive unfolding of a t=\r\nransformation process. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Complex rituals and speedy &lt;span i=\r\nd=3D&quot;misspell-65&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhanas&lt;/span&gt; and experiences &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-66&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;et&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-67&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-68&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;, pro=\r\nvided one does not lose sight of the fundamentals. THEN these can be useful=\r\n. Otherwise one ends up running in circles and going nowhere. An experience=\r\n-chaser is not necessary a spiritual entity. I had to learn this basic trut=\r\nh the hard-way. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1489213645-1673276006-1349828782=:63731--\r\n\n"}}
