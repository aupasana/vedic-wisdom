Rao &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; I\n&gt;  will give another example, in more detail. Bhargava Rama is Venus as\n&gt; per Maharshi Pararsara. Venus is the spirit of happiness within us. I\n&gt; will explain how Bhargava Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how the\n&gt; sense of happiness operates in its perfected form.\n&gt;\n&gt; This kind of subtle esoteric understanding is difficult to put in words, but\n&gt; I will try my best.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Jamadagni\n&gt;  (jamat+agni=constantly consuming fire) stands for divine awareness.\n&gt; Renuka (renu=particle) stands for matter. She was so pure that she could\n&gt;  hold water in a pot made of unbaked clay. When purified matter is\n&gt; infused with divine awareness, it gives rise to a perfected form of\n&gt; happiness or bliss.\n&gt;\n&gt; This happiness is liberating in nature and\n&gt; so Bhargava Rama is a brahmana and a rishi. This perfected form of\n&gt; happiness is also too powerful and tends to dominate over other forces\n&gt; within one. So Bhargava Rama also had kshatriya qualities &\n&gt; ancestry.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Renuka was enamored by a gandharva called\n&gt; Chitraratha (chitra=strange, ratha=desire), Jamadagni ordered Bhargava\n&gt; Rama to kill her. When the material that was instrumental in giving rise\n&gt;  to bliss is tainted with strange attachment, it needs to be cut off and\n&gt;  be recreated pure. Bhargava Rama made Renuka alive again by asking\n&gt; Jamadagni for a boon after obeying his word.\n&gt;\n&gt; Later, Jamadagni\n&gt; was killed by Kartavirya Arjuna, a great king, and that greatly\n&gt; disturbed Bharga Rama. Kartavirya means &quot;coming from Kritavirya&quot;.\n&gt; Kritavirya means one who has engaged in bravery. Coming from the verb\n&gt; rij (be firm and steady), Arjuna stands for steadiness and firmness.\n&gt; &quot;Kartavirya Arjuna&quot; stands for firmness and confidence coming from\n&gt; having engaged in bravery. When that cuts off the constant fire of\n&gt; divine awareness (Jamadagni) in one, that greatly disturbs the poise of\n&gt; one&#39;s bliss (Bhargava Rama). One&#39;s bliss returns to normal only after\n&gt; destroying all instincts of domination, pride, control and power inside\n&gt; one (kshatriyas). Such instincts and bliss do not go together well. So\n&gt; Bhargava Rama disliked kshatriyas for ever.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, Lord Rama\n&gt; was one kshatriya who Bhargava Rama had to bow to. As discussed before,\n&gt; Lord Rama is Sun (soul). Supreme are the power and command of soul,\n&gt; which keeps on magnanimously supporting various aspects of\n&gt; individualized consciouness in their pursuits. It is immensely strong\n&gt; and powerful and no wonder Rama was a kshatriya. Despite the supremely\n&gt; heroic work done by soul in supporting its subjects, it is perfect in\n&gt; detachment and has no agendas of its own. Finally Bhargava Rama met a\n&gt; kshatriya who was not only strong and heroic, but also had Brahma Tejas.\n&gt;  He had to bow. Similarly, bliss may be averse to instincts of heroic\n&gt; strength and control as they tend to disturb bliss, but, when bliss\n&gt; meets soul, it sees a powerful hero with perfect abandon, who is the\n&gt; source of various kinds of bliss.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly,\n&gt;  story of Lord Koorma demonstrates how persistence/patience in us\n&gt; operates in its perfected form, its nature, challenges it faces etc.\n&gt; Story of Lord Narasimha demonstrates how energy/drive in us operates in\n&gt; its perfected form, its nature, challenges it faces etc. And so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our\n&gt;  scriptures are not filled with meaningless stories. They are true\n&gt; stories of events in some other realms of being. They also\n&gt; metaphorically represent great inner truths that may occur within us.\n&gt; They can help us understand ourselves, how we can perfect various\n&gt; aspects of our personalities and how we can progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Chanting a deity&#39;s name or doing other rituals to a deity, are the first\n&gt; step. If a mantra is working, a corresponding aspect of our personality will\n&gt; become purified and perfected over time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr108@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To: Vedic Wisdom &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Wednesday, April 24, 2013 11:30 PM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Comparing Dasavataras!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu&#39;s Dasavataras on a limited access\n&gt;&gt; forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna\n&gt;&gt; is like going back from the linear progression of spirituality that the\n&gt;&gt; Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a\n&gt;&gt; &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama,\n&gt;&gt; Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We also\n&gt;  know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu\n&gt; are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning\n&gt; spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy,\n&gt; patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment\n&gt; (respectively).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in\n&gt;&gt; a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect operates.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord\n&gt;&gt; Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative\n&gt;&gt; operates.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in\n&gt;&gt; us,\n&gt;  learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience\n&gt; in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. However,\n&gt; when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities\n&gt; and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other\n&gt;&gt; aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end.\n&gt;&gt; Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and\n&gt;&gt; are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story that\n&gt;&gt; demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of\n&gt;&gt; mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who\n&gt;&gt; is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that\n&gt;  demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of\n&gt; taste and subjective preference.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a\n&gt;&gt; representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is\n&gt;&gt; the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul\n&gt;&gt; supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and\n&gt;&gt; sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of\n&gt;&gt; this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning\n&gt;&gt; ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no\n&gt;&gt; desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and\n&gt;&gt; records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper\n&gt;&gt; fruits later\n&gt;  on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those\n&gt; karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the\n&gt; individualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things\n&gt; and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees\n&gt; that as its dharma and does it impassionately.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an\n&gt;&gt; impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting enough\n&gt;&gt; to some.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly\n&gt;&gt; pursuing those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of\n&gt;&gt; mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the\n&gt;&gt; support for everything else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a\n&gt;&gt; witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the\n&gt;&gt; individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even\n&gt;&gt; decides/affects\n&gt;  every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the\n&gt; individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be\n&gt; excited by this description!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in\n&gt;&gt; perspective.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received\n&gt;&gt; Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was\n&gt;&gt; his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given\n&gt;&gt; kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the\n&gt;&gt; behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He\n&gt;&gt; had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt\n&gt;&gt; guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and\n&gt;&gt; followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the\n&gt;&gt; forest\n&gt;  with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did\n&gt; it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he\n&gt; searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing\n&gt; him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted\n&gt; every life situation with no complaints and did the best possible action\n&gt; then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as\n&gt; his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and\n&gt; respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with\n&gt; Ravana!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who\n&gt;&gt; impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas\n&gt;&gt; before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;As another example, let us look at Lord\n&gt;  Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination\n&gt; operates.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of\n&gt;&gt; a charitable demon king with many great qualities.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing\n&gt;&gt; good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment),\n&gt;&gt; one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When\n&gt;&gt; wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are\n&gt;&gt; completely suppressed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as\n&gt;&gt; perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousness\n&gt;&gt; operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of\n&gt;&gt; course, if you are more\n&gt;  attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develop\n&gt; devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are\n&gt;&gt; different schools of thought).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;\n\n"}}
