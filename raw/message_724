But, if it does, don&#39;t worry. Re-ignite it as =\r\nNarayan said, pray to Agni in the mind and continue.\n \nSuppose a servant is=\r\n asked by his master to carry a vessel of milk to a place without spilling =\r\nit on the way. Suppose a little milk is spilled on the way. What should he =\r\ndo? Should he abandon the project or atleast carry the remaining milk to th=\r\ne destination?\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs Narayan said, fire going away can=\r\n signal the bhutagni being weak.\n \nBut, one is better off ignoring those th=\r\nings and not thinking too much about the significance.\n \n*        *        =\r\n*\n \nI recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or badly it wen=\r\nt and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n \nThink of your favo=\r\nrite deity as the master and yourself as a servant. A servant simply serves=\r\n the master. Similarly, all the sadhana you do and your other activities ar=\r\ne your way to serve your master.\n \nA rich landlord may be very wealthy and =\r\nhave many big checks everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to =\r\nmail others. Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the b=\r\nank and do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this=\r\n world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this worl=\r\nd. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and various rishis k=\r\neep coming back to earth every now and then. The supreme god of this world =\r\noperates through various physical persons present on earth.\n \nWe do homam a=\r\nnd other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try to help others, becaus=\r\ne that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries master&#39;s papers to the bank=\r\n, we do such work for god.\n \nDoing what is applauded by others as good work=\r\n tends to promote ego and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a=\r\n million dollar check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a serva=\r\nnt carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely doing =\r\ntheir master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just *instruments* us=\r\ned by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, one who does what are =\r\nconsidered great deeds in this world and one who does what are considered m=\r\neagre deeds in this world are both servants of god helping god execute god&#39;=\r\ns agenda in this world. Neither really owns anything. One may consider ones=\r\nelf superior to the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by =\r\nthe world, but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers himself=\r\n/herself superior to another servant carrying something less valuable.\n \nIf=\r\n this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s attitude, t=\r\nhinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what situations his previous k=\r\narmas place one in. One can remain happy and blissful in pleasure and pain,=\r\n in praise and criticism and in light and darkness.\n \nHave the same attitud=\r\ne towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job you are doing for god. You d=\r\no the best you can. But you own nothing. You are doing it for god.\n \nBest r=\r\negards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nD=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n  Sub=\r\nject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n\n        Dear Narasi=\r\nmhaji\n\n        Reading your response another question came into my mind.

Ca=\r\nn a homam\n          &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base b=\r\ne used instead of a\n          &gt; copper one?\n\n          Yes, you can do it o=\r\nn a rooftop. Doing it in the open is actually better than doing it in close=\r\nd space. But realize that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella aroun=\r\nd to protect the fire if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good=\r\n if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n\n          Yes, =\r\nyou can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a s=\r\nquare shaped huma kunda.\n\n          &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using th=\r\ne mp3 audio file, should one repeat the\n          &gt; mantras mentally along =\r\nwith the audio?\n\n          One can repeat mentally while listening attentiv=\r\nely (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attent=\r\nion focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n\n          Suppose person X i=\r\ns chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in the mind. Suppos=\r\ne person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of the mantra and its=\r\n deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may be=\r\nnefit from the mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;..=\r\n One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is co=\r\nntrol over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n\n          =\r\nHowever, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mantra is subm=\r\nitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in the externa=\r\nl fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (even if feeble) i=\r\ns a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listening. Try to repea=\r\nt slowly.\n\n          &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other co=\r\nnditions/niyamas that\n          &gt; should be followed apart from having vege=\r\nterain food?\n\n          Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremo=\r\nny) has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n\n     =\r\n     One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever ru=\r\nles one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one s=\r\nhould eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before h=\r\nomam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hou=\r\nrs before homam.\n\n          By the way, if one without a sacred thread want=\r\ns to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility a=\r\nnd allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru an=\r\nd perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process =\r\nuntil the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam an=\r\nd other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropades=\r\na or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the person cro=\r\nsses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa =\r\nby guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold of pur=\r\nity.\n\n          As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and r=\r\neady to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, =\r\nI am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.\n\n          &gt; =\r\n4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?\n\n          Fo=\r\nr Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine=\r\n really.\n\n          * * *\n\n          Mentioning rain and rooftop homam remi=\r\nnded me of my India trip.\n\n          When I went to India in May 2008, I an=\r\nd my guru Manish traveled together to several places (on a specific project=\r\n). We ended up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we we=\r\nre). Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As mons=\r\noons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were =\r\nin New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment comp=\r\nlex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to r=\r\nain heavily in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n\n       =\r\n   To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offe=\r\nred poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily=\r\n, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we =\r\nheld it on top of the two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated.=\r\n We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kund=\r\nas went off and then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshet=\r\nra later that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few d=\r\nays in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the =\r\nnorth, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went to, as we f=\r\ninished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n\n          Best reg=\r\nards,\n          Narasimha\n          ------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedi=\r\ncastro. home..comcast. net\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath..org\n          ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- -\n\n          ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimpl=\r\ne@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n          &gt; Namasthe,\n          &gt; \n          &gt; I am i=\r\nnterested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few questions\n      =\r\n    &gt; regarding it.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on th=\r\ne roof top of a house(3-floors) ?

Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kundam=\r\n made by \n          arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of=\r\n a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          copper one?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. D=\r\noing it in the \n          open is actually better than doing it in closed s=\r\npace. But realize \n          that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrel=\r\nla around to protect the \n          fire if it rains while you are doing ho=\r\nmam. It is not good if fire is \n          extinguished by rain in the middl=\r\ne of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, you can \n          construct a homa kundam with b=\r\nricks and sand at the bottom. Use a \n          square shaped huma kunda.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2)While performing the Homam \n          using the mp3 audio file,=\r\n should one repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras \n          mentally along with the a=\r\nudio?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One can repeat mentally while \n          listening attentively=\r\n (not casually). Actually, even listening to \n          mantras with all th=\r\ne attention focused is as powerful as saying \n          mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sup=\r\npose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n          some mundane =\r\nmatter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n          with foc=\r\nus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n          may=\r\n do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n          m=\r\nantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n      =\r\n    say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n      =\r\n    control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the \n          ma=\r\nntra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, there is a difference between meditation and \n       =\r\n   homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it \n  =\r\n        is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making som=\r\ne \n          external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to s=\r\nilent \n          chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; 3)Can \n          bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other conditions=\r\n/niyamas \n          that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; should be followed apart from having veget=\r\nerain \n          food?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread =\r\nceremony) \n          has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is \n=\r\n          irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by=\r\n \n          one&#39;s guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow t=\r\nhem \n          strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian foo=\r\nd on the \n          day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule=\r\n I will \n          recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours befo=\r\nre \n          homam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the way, if one without a sacred thread want=\r\ns to do \n          homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take respo=\r\nnsibility and \n          allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me=\r\n or my guru as guru \n          and perform homam. I am willing to take on a=\r\nny karma incurred in the \n          process until the person crosses some m=\r\ninimum threshhold of purity \n          through homam and other spiritual pr=\r\nactices. Sacred thread or no \n          sacred thread, mantropadesa or no m=\r\nantropadesa, it does not matter \n          after a while, when the person c=\r\nrosses a threshhold of purity. The \n          goal of upanayanam and other =\r\nmantropadesa by guru is to speed this up \n          and make the person cro=\r\nss the threshhold of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As long as \n          one desires no sp=\r\necific material benefits (and ready to receive \n          whatever god give=\r\ns) and does homam for spiritual progress, I am \n          willing to help, =\r\neven if it means some suffering for me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          4)Any good d=\r\nate to start the Homam? or any day would be \n          fine?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For Mah=\r\naganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n          But any day i=\r\ns fine really.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mentioning rain and \n          rooftop h=\r\nomam reminded me of my India trip.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I went to \n          India i=\r\nn May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to several \n          pl=\r\naces (on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morning \n     =\r\n     in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me=\r\n \n          to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in June/Jul=\r\ny in \n          India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in=\r\n mid-May.. \n          We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex =\r\nwe were in, to do \n          a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is goi=\r\nng to rain heavily in \n          this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I jus=\r\nt smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To my \n          surprise, it did rain as soon as our homa=\r\ns finished. After we offered \n          poornaahuti, it suddenly started ra=\r\nining with really big drops. \n          Luckily, there was a small towel/bl=\r\nanket on the rooftop close to us. \n          Together, we held it on top of=\r\n the two small homa kundas, closed our \n          eyes and meditated. We he=\r\nld the cloth cover on the homa kundas until \n          fire in the two homa=\r\n kundas went off and then packed everything and \n          went down. We le=\r\nft for Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told \n          that a heavy=\r\n rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain \n          follo=\r\nwed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west of \n          In=\r\ndia. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in \n     =\r\n     that place and prepared to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n          regards,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- \n          -------=\r\n-- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri \n          Tarpanas You=\r\nrself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n          target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          tarpan=\r\na&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n          Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home..comcast. \n          net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www..vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath \n          Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www..srijagannath.org/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.SriJagan \n          nath..org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- \n          --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- Phanikumar Velaga &=\r\nlt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:itsverysimple%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\n\n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n          Namasthe,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapat=\r\ni \n          Homam daily, and have few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regarding it.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house=\r\n(3-floors) \n          ?
