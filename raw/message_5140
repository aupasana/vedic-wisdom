When I floated=\r\n the idea, Manish discouraged me. He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; =\r\nHe said that it could be considered later, but firmly told me to drop the i=\r\ndea for then.\n\n \n\nPlease note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, medi=\r\ntation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understan=\r\nding of what they mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its =\r\nenergy. They are storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadha=\r\nkas, who used them in the past.\n\n \n\nAn intellectual understanding may help =\r\nfacilitate the right mood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even=\r\n without it, a mantra that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis hol=\r\nds power.\n\n \n\nIn fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually =\r\nunderstand can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of =\r\na normal person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, =\r\nI suggest not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading San=\r\nskrit mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n\n \n\n*        *      =\r\n  *\n\n \n\nIf I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman=\r\n may read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the =\r\nball from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line o=\r\nf the ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and=\r\n when to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good =\r\nbatsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some=\r\n basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is =\r\nmore important than bookish knowledge.\n\n \n\nSimilarly, some conceptual under=\r\nstanding is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is more=\r\n important.\n\n \n\nThe essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, a=\r\nll paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we =\r\nare doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The di=\r\nvine acts through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives correspo=\r\nnding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the notions=\r\n of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Tho=\r\nugh this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be delu=\r\nded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this understa=\r\nnding fully and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.=\r\n\n\n \n\nSo, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellectually un=\r\nderstand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the =\r\nback of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s=\r\n own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhan=\r\na will yield results.\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\nThis is why I keep repeat=\r\ning the need of sadhana. It is fine to read scriptures and other books. It =\r\nis fine to meet spiritual people (physically or virtually, like here) and d=\r\niscuss good things. But that will only create a theoretical understanding. =\r\nFor it to be internalized and to govern all of one&#39;s instincts, thoughts an=\r\nd actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n\n \n\nOne doing sadhana without a basic t=\r\nheoretical understanding of what is what and what we want, is like a blind =\r\nperson running around a mountain, instead of climbing it. One not doing sad=\r\nhana, but having an excellent theoretical understanfing, is like a person w=\r\nho knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinn=\r\nacle instead of climbing it.\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\nRegarding the stat=\r\nement that initiation is important in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I=\r\n want to add my 2 cents.\n\n \n\nWhether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *disti=\r\nnct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccur=\r\nate notions today.\n\n \n\nThe issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue =\r\nis one&#39;s attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material r=\r\nesults needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of =\r\nkarmas to affect a particular result is not easy. It requires supervision o=\r\nf a good guru and not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NO=\r\nT looking for specific material results and is looking for spiritual progre=\r\nss, the constraints are fewer and options more.\n\n \n\nSome may sub-consciousl=\r\ny have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material result=\r\ns and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one=\r\n in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayu=\r\nshya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path m=\r\nay eat a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion tha=\r\nt &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.=\r\n\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\nMy thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a=\r\n specific material result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which n=\r\not many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progres=\r\ns and an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana withou=\r\nt initiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-mi=\r\nnded people.\n\n \n\nAfter all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear a=\r\nnd precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to go to north=\r\n pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supervision he=\r\nlps there too, but you can do without it!\n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\nNarasimha\n\n---=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Free Jyotish Sof=\r\ntware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n\n                  http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org\n\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.or=\r\ng\n\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n\n---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n---- vedic_pathak &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n\n&gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; The rea=\r\nson I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any &gt;other regional la=\r\nnguage is because understanding the meaning and &gt;constant reflection are po=\r\nssible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a language that they can=\r\n fully follow.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its understandabl=\r\ne.

Since=\r\n the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due =\r\nto various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an inte=\r\nrnet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original p=\r\nost with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed =\r\nthrough some posts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is =\r\nfar better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly brow=\r\nsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal j=\r\ni&#39;s question.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question rega=\r\nrding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the =\r\nbig picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE questio=\r\nn and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or speci=\r\nfic one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an abs=\r\nolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. Howeve=\r\nr if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadh=\r\nana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessit=\r\ny for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability=\r\n of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths f=\r\nor sadhana. But in the current context of this question I will restrict mys=\r\nelf to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a.=\r\n Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract=\r\n Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular method=\r\ns and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an e=\r\nxperiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniqu=\r\nes employed by each of these paths.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly =\r\noriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not =\r\nnecessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of=\r\n a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Vi=\r\nveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially=\r\n a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of =\r\n&#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All=\r\n of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role fo=\r\nr external practices.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-co=\r\naching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachme=\r\nnt). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orien=\r\nting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools=\r\n of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwarav=\r\nada.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional a=\r\ncceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the c=\r\nontrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagav=\r\nad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mains=\r\ntay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the T=\r\nantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initi=\r\nation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves t=\r\nhe practicalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda th=\r\nrough the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any=\r\n lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It shou=\r\nld be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at=\r\n various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference her=\r\ne is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one=\r\n path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech=\r\n, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Y=\r\nagnya and so on.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with=\r\n the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra =\r\nemploys highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays =\r\ngreat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about =\r\nqualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any =\r\nsupervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like =\r\nany other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the pro=\r\ncedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment to=\r\no.  However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awa=\r\nkening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as K=\r\nundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I wil=\r\nl refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into othe=\r\nr needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru param=\r\npara.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to =\r\ncontextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is on=\r\ne major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the e=\r\nntire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three majo=\r\nr schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas=\r\n- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikul=\r\na whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture mo=\r\nre complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. =\r\nTo those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to th=\r\ne the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook=\r\n as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all)=\r\n while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestone=\r\ns in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc =\r\nare all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for e=\r\nach of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the pr=\r\nactitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Gur=\r\nu parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the ro=\r\not from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spre=\r\nad out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautif=\r\nul metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can u=\r\nse is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiati=\r\non not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity =\r\nbut also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful\n bulbs/lights at ea=\r\nch point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long series =\r\nof sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself.  I=\r\nt is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri =\r\nSri Chandi.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken =\r\nSakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated approach th=\r\nat combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Ka=\r\nlikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated ap=\r\nproaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi s=\r\neemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fledg=\r\ned Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a =\r\ntext on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is r=\r\nelevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the text=\r\n as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, the=\r\n esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my w=\r\nrite-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri C=\r\nhandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its c=\r\nentral message\n of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text=\r\n is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanis=\r\nhadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in th=\r\nis universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the oth=\r\ner Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita=\r\n.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English o=\r\nr any other regional language is because understanding the meaning and cons=\r\ntant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the text  in a =\r\nlanguage that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to exp=\r\nlore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obvious stat=\r\nus as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti=\r\n just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard all th=\r\ne applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally possible wit=\r\nh Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is ac=\r\nquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify that Yag=\r\nnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha =\r\nin the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping=\r\n of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some p=\r\nractitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in =\r\naccordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantr=\r\nic approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particul=\r\nar approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is =\r\nnot mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the=\r\n Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of readi=\r\nng the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if =\r\none is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. =\r\nOne may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. Howe=\r\nver one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions of bot=\r\nh Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of t=\r\nhe subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the i=\r\nmportance of initiation for those paths, be it\n Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya=\r\n.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of=\r\n the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, I=\r\nswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc a=\r\nre all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude=\r\n etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practi=\r\ntioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in =\r\nspiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA =\r\ninvolves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer=\r\n to the question has to be contextualised.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last =\r\nword. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the =\r\nmost effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of te=\r\nxts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is be=\r\nst done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA i=\r\nt is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternat=\r\ne method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Sa=\r\ntsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spir=\r\nitual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of se=\r\nrving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in=\r\n his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  made a quantum=\r\n leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakri=\r\nshna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For thos=\r\ne who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote =\r\nSwami Sivananda:\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE  // &quot;There is a complaint by householders now=\r\nadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company o=\r\nf Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, =\r\nthe supply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you =\r\nare really thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a=\r\n happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You =\r\ndo not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossi=\r\nping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, =\r\ngreed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga=\r\n.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall ta=\r\nke you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right pat=\r\nh, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high =\r\nsouls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are =\r\nin plenty.\n Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good=\r\n Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seeker=\r\ns after Truth.&quot;.&quot;  //UNQUOTE\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this f=\r\norum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavan=\r\na, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparable to the act=\r\nual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-=\r\nvedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ra=\r\nmakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/ch=\r\nants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by discern=\r\nment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as=\r\n this, one makes progress truly.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may not interact regularl=\r\ny or reply at least for a while. However I might participate in some discus=\r\nsions on and off.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read this messa=\r\nge of respected Narasimha Garu few times. Frankly, i found it routine becau=\r\nse i found that i know all these already as he has so many times mentioned =\r\nthese things  and then it suddenly occoured to me that he has given answer =\r\nto a very very crucial query which keep on haunting many people and confuse=\r\n people a lot. I am obviously talking about &quot;Initiation&quot; and he has really =\r\ngiven an answer to this greatly confusing phenomina. I am reproducing this =\r\nagain below. for me i am completely satisfied with simple but very effectiv=\r\ne defination. i would draw attention of members to following paragraph agai=\r\nn:\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any man=\r\ntra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several =\r\nmaterial desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this rit=\r\nual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not necessa=\r\nrily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increas=\r\ne my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE=\r\n. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ]\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Its a time to say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true se=\r\nnse!

I like him as i like =\r\nThakur and Sachin Tendulkar :)\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Vijaya Dasami!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) I do not share Dr =\r\nChoudhary&#39;s opinion about reading English translation instead of Sanskrit v=\r\nerses if one is not initiated.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Initiation serves =\r\ntwo purposes:\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2a) As in the analogy I gave earlier, =\r\na rich father may open a bank account in a son&#39;s name with a starting balan=\r\nce of one million dollars. Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a man=\r\ntra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich fath=\r\ner is still better off opening a bank account with a zero balance and build=\r\ning it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a gur=\r\nu can still do sadhana with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual ac=\r\ncount. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly in=\r\nitiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for get=\r\nting specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender an=\r\nd making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that im=\r\nportant. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare=\r\n one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHowever, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i) =\r\nnow-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali=\r\n progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surren=\r\nder, getting whatever material results god wants to give and making spiritu=\r\nal progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* materia=\r\nl results (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature wi=\r\nll make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But,=\r\n as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any =\r\nhomam, do it  with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I =\r\ndo not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any ma=\r\nterial results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. =\r\nI will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surren=\r\nder and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not requ=\r\nired. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gent=\r\nle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce de=\r\nities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy=\r\n earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit b=\r\nasket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit fr=\r\nom under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the spilla=\r\nge of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressi=\r\nve, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on t=\r\nhe floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieve=\r\nd faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is tryi=\r\nng to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit t=\r\no eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or=\r\n Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spillage wil=\r\nl be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha =\r\nmay have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, b=\r\nut fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat eac=\r\nh of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits i=\r\ns better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentle=\r\nr deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru b=\r\nefore starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras =\r\nwithout initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it =\r\nis a fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good r=\r\nesults. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant =\r\nof rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took several hours t=\r\no read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chan=\r\ndi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have tra=\r\nnsformed a lot and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they have d=\r\none sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in=\r\n some past lives.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and ra=\r\nnk materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is=\r\n important, is looking for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadh=\r\nana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good karmas and good =\r\nvasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sad=\r\nhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good=\r\n understanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do somethin=\r\ng, how to do it, what is more important and what is less important, that is=\r\n what initiation is all about!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1146931242-1288089773=:39450\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Would it not be =\r\nof immense help to the ordinary person whose knowledge of Sanskrit is limit=\r\ned not only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more interest, enjoy=\r\nment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ reading?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dnyan=\r\neshwar to compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;But I agree with you that the sacred stotras should be recited in sanskri=\r\nt...&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humbly,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Girish=\r\n Shahapurkar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Tue, 26/10/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;i&gt;&lt;pvr@c=\r\nharter.net&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px soli=\r\nd rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Translations,=\r\n\n Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date:=\r\n Tuesday, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv277952686&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2=\r\n77952686ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nI wil=\r\nl give my 2 cents on a few points.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nI once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu in =\r\npoetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to r=\r\nead or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can read th=\r\ne Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. H=\r\ne asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered=\r\n later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nPlease note=\r\n that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and =\r\nprayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They =\r\nare tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses =\r\nof some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the pas=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAn intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mo=\r\nod, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra t=\r\nhat was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nIn =\r\nfact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be=\r\n more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person t=\r\nhat one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not wor=\r\nrying about whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras com=\r\ning from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nIf I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may =\r\nread a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball =\r\nfrom the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the=\r\n ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when=\r\n to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good batsm=\r\nan. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some basi=\r\nc understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more =\r\nimportant than bookish knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, some conceptual unde=\r\nrstanding is important in spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is mor=\r\ne important.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nThe essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadh=\r\nanas, all paths is very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions t=\r\nhat we are doing things and realize that the divine acts through all of us.=\r\n The divine acts through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives c=\r\norresponding reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the =\r\nnotions of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; e=\r\ntc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may =\r\nbe deluded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this u=\r\nnderstanding fully and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is min=\r\ne&quot; etc.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nSo, even if one practices a mantra that one does not inte=\r\nllectually understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptur=\r\nes is at the back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watchi=\r\nng over one&#39;s own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts,=\r\n one&#39;s sadhana will yield results.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nThis is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read script=\r\nures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or vi=\r\nrtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a th=\r\neoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of one=\r\n&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nOne =\r\ndoing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what and=\r\n what we want, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead of=\r\n climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical un=\r\nderstanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mountain=\r\n, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*    =\r\n    *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nRegarding the statement that initiation is importa=\r\nnt in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nWhether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a c=\r\nontinuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nThe issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude an=\r\nd what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be c=\r\nareful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a p=\r\narticular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and no=\r\nt many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specif=\r\nic material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints =\r\nare fewer and options more.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nSome may sub-consciously have a notio=\r\nn that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic pa=\r\nth is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic =\r\npath may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam f=\r\nor longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross=\r\n substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brah=\r\nman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*  =\r\n      *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nMy thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a s=\r\npecific material result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which not=\r\n many are capable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress =\r\nand an increase of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without =\r\ninitiation or guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-mind=\r\ned people.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAfter all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need cle=\r\nar and precise directions and some supervision. If you just want to go to n=\r\north pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, having supervisio=\r\nn helps there too, but you can do without it!&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nN=\r\narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n         =\r\n         &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Films that make a d=\r\nifference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nof=\r\nollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n---- vedic_pathak &lt;&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;vedic_pathak@...&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any &gt;other r=\r\negional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;constant refl=\r\nection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a langua=\r\nge that they can fully follow.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yes Sir, if this is the r=\r\neason then its understandable.

Whats your opinion on this.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Please take your time!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/co=\r\nmpose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am=\r\n forwarding a reply sent by Dr Satya Prakash Choudhary.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:10:31 -0000&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: &quot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;mindcareclinic@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;a=\r\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom-owner%40yahoogroups.com&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom-owner%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom-owner@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Ini=\r\ntiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Meaning)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n All Glories to the Goddess!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am Sa=\r\ntya Prakash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the last 4-5 yea=\r\nrs I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reason=\r\ns. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. Howev=\r\ner after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write=\r\n up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some post=\r\ns. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far better and mo=\r\nre sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this =\r\nparticular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important questi=\r\non regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizi=\r\nng the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE =\r\nquestion and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general o=\r\nr specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is=\r\n an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO.=\r\n However if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mant=\r\nra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric a=\r\ndage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths=\r\n. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian=\r\n context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of th=\r\nis question I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to th=\r\ne discussion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advait=\r\nic/Vedantic)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love=\r\n/Devotion)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Se=\r\nlfless Actions)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is no=\r\nthing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. =\r\nEach of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its=\r\n attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let =\r\nus briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of =\r\nthese paths.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to=\r\n Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, =\r\nthough one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine =\r\nteacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Disce=\r\nrnment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culminat=\r\nion of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39;=\r\n (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these p=\r\nractices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external =\r\npractices.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abh=\r\nyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or=\r\n Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswaraprani=\r\ndhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and=\r\n Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe t=\r\no nirishwaravada.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love=\r\n/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through tot=\r\nal surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is=\r\n on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without a=\r\nttachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of=\r\n mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and ther=\r\neby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicaliz=\r\nation of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the empl=\r\noyment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experimen=\r\nt and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remember=\r\ned that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various level=\r\ns, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the ag=\r\ne-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/=\r\nemploys the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the =\r\nfire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so o=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire =\r\ndeals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Sin=\r\nce Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that bring results more quickl=\r\ny it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but m=\r\nore about qualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire wi=\r\nthout any supervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or =\r\nnot? Like any other lab experiment proper training and experience are part =\r\nof the procedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab exp=\r\neriment too.  However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experim=\r\nent is awakening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referr=\r\ned to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisat=\r\nion, I will refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going=\r\n into other needless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and =\r\nGuru parampara.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking=\r\n about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantri=\r\nc context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric context.=\r\n The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. How=\r\never there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living tr=\r\naditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to Sr=\r\nikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Budd=\r\nhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Bu=\r\nddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayan=\r\na shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its app=\r\nroach to sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predomi=\r\nnantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula p=\r\nredominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal=\r\n spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consisten=\r\ntly of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these thre=\r\ne lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a=\r\n particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can b=\r\ne compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the=\r\n trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressiv=\r\nely downward till the individual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if yo=\r\nu can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of ele=\r\nctricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only compl=\r\netes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents=\r\n short circuit. Imagine many\n beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this =\r\ninverted tree of live wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitti=\r\nng in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic wo=\r\nrld of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to =\r\nawaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated appr=\r\noach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. =\r\nBoth Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integr=\r\nated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri C=\r\nhandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a ful=\r\nl-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneo=\r\nusly a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiati=\r\non is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing t=\r\nhe text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasast=\r\nra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively =\r\nin my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections throug=\r\nh its\n central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in t=\r\nhe text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged=\r\n Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exis=\r\nt in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with =\r\nthe other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of =\r\nAdvaita.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the no=\r\nn-initiate to read in English or any other regional language is because und=\r\nerstanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one r=\r\nepeatedly reads the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The mai=\r\nn idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text =\r\ntoo apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is=\r\n also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the fo=\r\nur hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda S=\r\namhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of C=\r\nhandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will=\r\n straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact e=\r\nven the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DE=\r\nRIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the =\r\nHomam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the =\r\nVedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do t=\r\nhe sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that nee=\r\nds initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one=\r\n adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhya=\r\nsa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly=\r\n as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined =\r\nto the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from=\r\n any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear =\r\nin mind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well a=\r\ns Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent orig=\r\ninally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiat=\r\nion for those\n paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through an=\r\ny of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichar=\r\na, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa e=\r\ntc are all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, apti=\r\ntude etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different pr=\r\nactitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods=\r\n in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIK=\r\nULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the an=\r\nswer to the question has to be contextualised.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWAD=\r\nHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya=\r\n is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expoun=\r\nded in the texts. This is best done in a language that one is fully convers=\r\nant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all method=\r\ns. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsang=\r\nha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to=\r\n make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare e=\r\nxalted state by virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the co=\r\nmpany of sadhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and=\r\n  Gorakhnath  made a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after they atten=\r\nded the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectiv=\r\nely.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about th=\r\ne scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE  // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that =\r\nthere are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is=\r\n a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply =\r\nwill come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really =\r\nthirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-l=\r\nucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care=\r\n a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and va=\r\nin, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and =\r\nname and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make =\r\nyourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to t=\r\nhe lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide yo=\r\nu and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are w=\r\naiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in\n plenty.=\r\n Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot;=\r\n Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Tru=\r\nth.&quot;.&quot;  //UNQUOTE&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain exten=\r\nt even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appro=\r\npriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparab=\r\nle to the actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chan=\r\ndi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas s=\r\nuch as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifti=\r\nng kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflectio=\r\nn, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a =\r\ngroup such as this, one makes progress truly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least for a while.

Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a m=\r\nantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich fa=\r\nther is still better off opening a bank account with a zero balance and bui=\r\nlding it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a g=\r\nuru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual =\r\naccount. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly =\r\ninitiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals a=\r\nre used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (i=\r\ni) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the c=\r\nase of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), the=\r\nre are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in tro=\r\nuble otherwise.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i) n=\r\now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali =\r\nprogressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrend=\r\ner, getting whatever material results god wants to give and making spiritua=\r\nl progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material=\r\n results (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature wil=\r\nl make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, =\r\nas one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath =\r\nor any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it  with the attitude of &quot;I ha=\r\nve several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because =\r\nof this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and =\r\nnot necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want=\r\n to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You ar=\r\ne then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiat=\r\nion!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle d=\r\neities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deitie=\r\ns give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy ear=\r\nlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit baske=\r\nt and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from u=\r\nnder them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage o=\r\nf rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, =\r\none may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the f=\r\nloor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved fa=\r\nster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying t=\r\no take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to ea=\r\nt. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lak=\r\nshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be=\r\n minimal.
