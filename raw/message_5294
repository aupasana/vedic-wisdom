When purush starte=\r\nd to create universe(matter,energy,antimatter or what ever the physical stu=\r\nff exists...) Mahattatva was created this mahattatva holds the three type o=\r\nf Chittas based on their actions. However, this mahattatva is Maha purush w=\r\nho holds the billion universe in each of his &quot;Randra&quot;. This mahapurush is c=\r\nombination of Purush and prakruti. since prakruti is ever changing with tim=\r\ne and ever stay stable it is called dynamic and purush who never changes bu=\r\nt always steasy like water in ice, he is called dynamic. Everything we see,=\r\nfeel,do is done is time dimension. if one of this is absence we will neithe=\r\nr be able to exists nor be able to feel anything. Hence it is combination o=\r\nf this two causes world to exists. As Bhagavat says, before Mahattatva, &quot;Ah=\r\namkar&quot; was also created or Mahattatva is &quot;Ahamkar&quot;. Let me just explain som=\r\nething about &quot;ahamkar&quot;. Ahamkar is something within which creates reaction.=\r\n like our reflex, is produce due to ahamkar, something sting on hand your o=\r\nther hand goes to scretch or squze is due to ahamkar, our vision is due to =\r\nahamkar. any ab-normality or any property of an object is due to ahamkar. s=\r\ntone ahamkar is keeping stone in shape. Anyway, it is purush and prakruti w=\r\nhich makes universe but it by any means does not respresent gender.\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;parijat_d&quot; &lt;parijat_d@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNamaste ,\n&gt; &gt; \t Thanks a lot to the learned members for clarifying my doubt=\r\ns earlier.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wanted to know about the essence of the concept of pu=\r\nrusha and prakriti.Why is it said that purusha is static and prakriti or sh=\r\nakti is\n&gt; &gt; dynamic ?\n&gt; &gt; wat is essentially meant by the words..&quot;static&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and &quot;dynamic&quot; ??....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lookin forward to hear from u all..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Parijat Dutta\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
