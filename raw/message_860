You can break each \n            coconut Ha=\r\nlf with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.\n\n            2) A very =\r\nsmall bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is \n            sufficie=\r\nnt as &#39;Ghee Aahutis&#39; are to be given as only a single drop \n            whe=\r\nnever it is mentioned in the Manual.\n\n            3) When Ghee Aahutis are =\r\nspecifically not mentioned, one can offer \n            Aaahutis of Mamara (=\r\nKurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya \n            etc... Now one=\r\n can choose each of the above stuffs one by one for \n            offering a=\r\ns aahuti or can use single stuff.\n\n            to elaborate, at each Swaha,=\r\n one can take One Kishmis or Few Mamara \n            or one almond or one c=\r\nahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer to Agni.\n\n            If you have Havan S=\r\naamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuff \n            which can be o=\r\nffer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered as \n            Aahuti s=\r\name as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take \n            very=\r\n little &#39;Havan samgri powder and offer it.\n\n            Thus one person can=\r\n easily perform homam as explained above because \n            firstly, one =\r\ndoesn&#39;t need to give Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff \n            simultane=\r\nously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be done with \n            left =\r\nfingers while offering aahutis by right hand.\n\n            2 kg of Havan Sa=\r\namagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms \n            will be suffi=\r\ncient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..\n\n            4) The Ho=\r\nma Fire represents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. \n            hence =\r\nit is suggested that Aahutis are only offered by You alone \n            whi=\r\nle mother and others can sit beside you and concentrate. they \n            =\r\nwill gain lot of spiritual benefit just by attending.\n\n            5) Woode=\r\nn Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that copper one can \n            als=\r\no be used.\n\n            6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who=\r\n offer ghee \n            aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i th=\r\nink i&#39;ve also seen \n            that during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during =\r\nNavaraatri. I suppose it \n            also must be one of the right ways. h=\r\nowever i have complete faith in \n            what Narasimha has given in Ma=\r\nnual and that also must be the other \n            right way of many ways. a=\r\nlthough you can choose between the above \n            two, i recommend to g=\r\no as per the Manual if you are going to do as \n            per the manual g=\r\niven by him.\n\n            Lastly, i would suggest not to bother yourself wi=\r\nth much \n            technicalities and burden of perfection. in the first =\r\nfew runs, \n            there are many things during Havan which can go impe=\r\nrefct. do as per \n            manual and enjoy you Homam with your mother &=\r\n others and offcourse \n            with the mother of universe !!!\n\n       =\r\n     I hope, i gave you the answers - Beautifully.\n\n            Warm Regard=\r\ns,\n\n            Utpal\n\n            --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;=\r\nDHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n            &lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:\n            &gt;\n    =\r\n        &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n        =\r\n    &gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ &gt; wrote:\n            &gt; &gt;\n            &gt; &gt; Namaskar Nar=\r\nsimhaji and others,\n            &gt; &gt; \n            &gt; &gt; I want to do homam for=\r\n chandi \n            devi.I \n            &gt; &gt; had arranged a copper tray in =\r\nsquare shape.Almost 1 feet by 1 \n            &gt; feet. \n            &gt; &gt; So is=\r\n it good measurement or not ?

You can break each &lt;BR&gt;coconut Half wi=\r\nth your \n            both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) A ver=\r\ny small bowl \n            of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is &lt;BR&gt;su=\r\nfficient as &#39;Ghee \n            Aahutis&#39; are to be given as only a single dr=\r\nop &lt;BR&gt;whenever it is \n            mentioned in the Manual.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) When =\r\nGhee Aahutis are \n            specifically not mentioned, one can offer &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Aaahutis of Mamara \n            (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, D=\r\naadiya &lt;BR&gt;etc... Now one \n            can choose each of the above stuffs =\r\none by one for &lt;BR&gt;offering as \n            aahuti or can use single stuff.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;to elaborate, at each Swaha, \n            one can take One Kishmis =\r\nor Few Mamara &lt;BR&gt;or one almond or one \n            cahsenut, or few Daadiy=\r\na and offer to Agni.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have Havan \n            Saamagri (I supp=\r\nose it is mixuture of some stuff &lt;BR&gt;which can be \n            offer in to =\r\nHoma fire), then it can also be offered as &lt;BR&gt;Aahuti \n            same as =\r\nlike other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take &lt;BR&gt;very \n            li=\r\nttle &#39;Havan samgri powder and offer it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus one person can \n       =\r\n     easily perform homam as explained above because &lt;BR&gt;firstly, one \n    =\r\n        doesn&#39;t need to give Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff \n            &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;simultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be done \n          =\r\n  with &lt;BR&gt;left fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2 \n   =\r\n         kg of Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms \n  =\r\n          &lt;BR&gt;will be sufficient if you use along with along with Kurmura \n=\r\n            etc..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) The Homa Fire represents Bhootagni of the perso=\r\nn \n            doing Homam. &lt;BR&gt;hence it is suggested that Aahutis are only=\r\n offered \n            by You alone &lt;BR&gt;while mother and others can sit besi=\r\nde you and \n            concentrate. they &lt;BR&gt;will gain lot of spiritual be=\r\nnefit just by \n            attending.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but i=\r\nn the absence of \n            that copper one can &lt;BR&gt;also be used.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n6) I have not much idea \n            about the way of priest who offer ghee=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;aahuti in Homa Agni as \n            well as in water bowl. i think i&#39;v=\r\ne also seen &lt;BR&gt;that during Chandi \n            Homam of Ashtami during Nav=\r\naraatri. I suppose it &lt;BR&gt;also must be \n            one of the right ways. =\r\nhowever i have complete faith in &lt;BR&gt;what \n            Narasimha has given =\r\nin Manual and that also must be the other \n            &lt;BR&gt;right way of man=\r\ny ways. although you can choose between the \n            above &lt;BR&gt;two, i r=\r\necommend to go as per the Manual if you are going \n            to do as &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;per the manual given by him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lastly, i would \n            suggest n=\r\not to bother yourself with much &lt;BR&gt;technicalities and \n            burden =\r\nof perfection. in the first few runs, &lt;BR&gt;there are many \n            thing=\r\ns during Havan which can go imperefct. do as per &lt;BR&gt;manual and \n          =\r\n  enjoy you Homam with your mother &amp; others and offcourse &lt;BR&gt;with \n   =\r\n         the mother of universe !!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope, i gave you the answers -=\r\n \n            Beautifully.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warm Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In =\r\n&lt;A \n            href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank \n            rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;DHEERA=\r\nJ KHOSLA&quot; \n            &lt;BR&gt;&lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; --- In &lt;A \n            href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank \n            rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n            Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I want to \n            do homam for chandi &lt;BR&gt;devi.I &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; had arranged a copper \n            tray in square shape.Almost=\r\n 1 feet by 1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feet. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n            So is it good measur=\r\nement or not ?

Its my weakness actually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In normal homams by priests in \n            India ,they do=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;swaha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with ghee in fire aswell in \n            water.So =\r\ntell me, I mean after they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pour &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ghee \n            th=\r\nrough spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of &lt;BR&gt;ghee \n          =\r\n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in water too. So is it correct way or not ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n      =\r\n      &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If single person is doing a homam \n =\r\n           then how to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; manage &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ahutis of ghee and sam=\r\nagri \n            both and of course mantra mala or &lt;BR&gt;notes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; u &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n            provided ? Bcz in India, normally full group or fa=\r\nmily do homams \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; priest only says man=\r\ntras.So i think two \n            people r must for homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; I have spoon \n            made of wood ,Is it ok or i have to &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; buy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of \n            copper metal ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; I am still unmarried so \n            can i do with my mother &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; chandi homam \n            ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Please provide me some \n            beautiful answers of the=\r\nse &lt;BR&gt;&gt; queries.And &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dont \n            mind if my queries =\r\nprove to be very simple and &lt;BR&gt;illogical.But \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; i &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; have to start from basics .So just \n            cooperate with me =\r\nas i love &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; work with \n            perfection.In next m=\r\nail i will ask some queries on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nin order to understand properly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &gt; U =\r\nr really spreading vedic wisdom in true practical sense.
