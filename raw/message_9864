Everyone,\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I just thought of add=\r\ning some clarifications.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;First of all, when I mentioned about the =\r\nutility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for hand=\r\nling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other problems for w=\r\nhich we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited to t=\r\nhe utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about whether=\r\n past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anythin=\r\ng whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT=\r\n...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of=\r\n the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still continue wi=\r\nth life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Thoug=\r\nh we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is=\r\n the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=A0in the e=\r\nast&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on =\r\ncontinuing with activities which helps\n in keeping life go on...It is in th=\r\nis sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside a sea just by sta=\r\nnding at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities. When we say tha=\r\nt the God is infinite, we just can not say that the universe can behave in =\r\nany particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about the utility of an=\r\ny branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincere dip into the same.=\r\n By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one really takes a sincere=\r\n dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced about the same.=C2=\r\n=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere dip, =\r\nI just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would prevent oneself from bei=\r\nng dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in religion and religious p=\r\nractices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in science if one loses th=\r\ne scientific temper.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I =\r\ncan say to the persons willing to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnother=\r\napy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=C2=A0those who are=\r\n desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind. Those who are int=\r\nerested can read &quot; Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to start with.\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To respected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are =\r\nnot &quot;new age ideas&quot;. These were there much before in India. to cite concept=\r\n of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this technique=\r\n of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the followers.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To =\r\nPhil Stinnet, I would like to inform that=C2=A0so far as my knowledge goes =\r\nPast Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, but however, there a=\r\nre so many problems which can be handled even over phone. To cite one examp=\r\nle - One girl was having=C2=A0one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past 4=\r\n/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for the treatment.=C2=A0But due to my=\r\n=C2=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off place for around 2 mo=\r\nnths.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsened as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 started af=\r\nfecting her professional career adversely. So having left with no choice, I=\r\n agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone session continued for a=\r\nround one and half an hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent dre=\r\nam and also started improving her professional life. Since that day the dre=\r\nam has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;It all depends on the openness o=\r\nf the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe is muc=\r\nh more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to see.\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajar=\r\nshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt;To add t=\r\no the complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding of the reincar=\r\nnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is o=\r\nf the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives=\r\n when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which mean=\r\ns if one has lived a life where there never was any opportunity for the sou=\r\nl to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death =\r\nis a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is ge=\r\nnerated based on need.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of =\r\na soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Th=\r\nerefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. It is like an ener=\r\ngy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to give the impres=\r\nsion of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spr=\r\nead into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into=\r\n another formation at a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous o=\r\nr at a different point can coalesce into a different part. =C2=A0 Hence it =\r\nis possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the som=\r\ne parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another part of his e=\r\nnergy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have =\r\nhis energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind in=\r\ncarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating in another p=\r\nerson and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation look=\r\ned at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a sup=\r\nreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are =\r\nreplete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illu=\r\nsion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is no=\r\nthing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards stri=\r\nct and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;\n&gt;But the old Vedant=\r\nic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death un=\r\nlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and the c=\r\nhief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul&#39;s influence=\r\n on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for thi=\r\ns purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no=\r\n two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciousl=\r\ny* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A S=\r\nupreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only one among many=\r\n possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state \nof complete negation/Sh=\r\nunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there was just no ne=\r\ned for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. The law of Kar=\r\nma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take o=\r\nf energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is =\r\nwhether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surfa=\r\nce. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is=\r\n a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratna=\r\nkara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can transform himsel=\r\nf into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hundred tim=\r\nes to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whereas those aspect=\r\ns of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly gover=\r\nned by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being perishabl=\r\ne, the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it is o=\r\nnly the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cinematic=\r\n biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been lives =\r\nwhen the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those are =\r\ndead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature, those li=\r\nves serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Moreover all these are possible ONLY i=\r\nf and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a very ve=\r\nry strong manner. That is not easy. \n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ether=\r\neal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter throu=\r\ngh them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Nar=\r\nasimha P.V.R.

I am s=\r\nure there too one can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfort=\r\nunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is conside=\r\nred to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of Bha=\r\nirava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He =\r\nis also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. Reference=\r\ns to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of t=\r\nhe Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n fo=\r\nllowers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and spec=\r\nially during rituals\n of cremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is=\r\n (there are many variations of this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om=\r\n Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ge=\r\nnerally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. An=\r\nd this should be continued daily till such time that there is some visible =\r\nrelief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of sp=\r\nirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid=\r\n the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has =\r\nthat kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. =\r\nPhysical presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to he=\r\nlp.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will have to do th=\r\ne sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you wi=\r\nll find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a for=\r\neign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, =\r\nthen I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and =\r\nthen go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside t=\r\nhe temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two te=\r\nmples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in =\r\nremoving any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for =\r\nthe ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific=\r\n samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their =\r\nrituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure=\r\n their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp =\r\nthee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue t=\r\nhee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_ja=\r\nmnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent=\r\n: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mant=\r\nra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are various classes and kinds and types of entities w=\r\nhich can possess an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, these all =\r\nsadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actual=\r\nly work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, t=\r\nhere is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s=\r\n)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for the same is=\r\n. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what =\r\naction allowed them to enter into the person.\n Sometimes it can be\n somethi=\r\nng\n as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or\n causa=\r\nlly entering into their territory and being susceptible to such possession =\r\nby certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entit=\r\nies are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever=\r\n be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handl=\r\ning such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the a=\r\nmount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in order to =\r\nremove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevo=\r\nlent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this=\r\n, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing poss=\r\nession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sad=\r\nhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even=\r\n basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its reperc=\r\nussion and one must know well how to\n handle the same too. Again\n if a spir=\r\nit is removed by force before the time till which, based on previous karma,=\r\n it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then that too start=\r\ns a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant consequences f=\r\nor the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was=\r\n an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his G=\r\nuides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the =\r\nspirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the=\r\n spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice th=\r\ne spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for t=\r\nhe spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it woul=\r\nd work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had =\r\nto be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do is a) find someone\n who knows exa=\r\nctly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the ev=\r\nent the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of=\r\n any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanum=\r\nana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient=\r\n force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa=\r\n may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spe=\r\nnd 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/deter=\r\nmination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep =\r\na bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possessed individ=\r\nual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible=\r\n. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a =\r\nhundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure=\r\n I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-S=\r\nri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To=\r\n: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: =\r\nSaturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra=\r\n for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble =\r\nfalling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  creaking and somethi=\r\nng moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t =\r\nsee anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather evil is present=\r\n in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I wa=\r\ns staying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because of a fe=\r\neling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I started focus=\r\ning on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state =\r\nbreathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed =\r\nand a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This=\r\n doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware a=\r\nnd I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that p=\r\nlace disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying at that plac=\r\ne and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going =\r\nto sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at home, f=\r\neeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in hei=\r\nght, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the str=\r\nange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there=\r\n any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? =\r\nSomething that I can chant before going to sleep.

However=\r\n, in our this empirical life we have to still continue with life irrespecti=\r\nve of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure=\r\n that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way aro=\r\nund, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises&nbsp;in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun&nbsp;se=\r\nts&nbsp;in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with ac=\r\ntivities which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d m=\r\nentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div =\r\nid=3D&quot;yiv0853806741yui_3_13_0_1_1382848409728_27183&quot;&gt;&lt;span\n id=3D&quot;yiv085380=\r\n6741yui_3_13_0_7_1382848409728_42&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv0853806=\r\n741yui_3_13_0_1_1382848409728_27451&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv0853806741yui_3_13_0_7_=\r\n1382848409728_43&quot;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside a sea just=\r\n by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities. When we =\r\nsay that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the universe can beh=\r\nave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about the utilit=\r\ny of any branch of knowledge one&nbsp;must first take a sincere dip into th=\r\ne same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if&nbsp;one really takes a =\r\nsincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced about the sa=\r\nme.&nbsp;By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere=\r\n dip, I just mean to say that&nbsp;by doing so one would prevent oneself fr=\r\nom being dogmatic, narrow. Not only&nbsp;blind belief in religion and relig=\r\nious practices&nbsp;can be termed as dogmatic but also in\n science if one l=\r\noses the scientific temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv0853806741yui_3_13_0_=\r\n1_1382848409728_36699&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv0853806741yui_3_13_0_7_1382848409728_=\r\n45&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv0853806741yui_3_13_0_1_1382848409728_3=\r\n5113&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv0853806741yui_3_13_0_7_1382848409728_46&quot;&gt;Proof of pudd=\r\ning is in eating it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address a=\r\nny of their problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immens=\r\ne utility for&nbsp;those who are desirous of addressing their problems with=\r\n an open mind.

To cite one example - One girl was havi=\r\nng&nbsp;one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she&nbsp;=\r\napproached me for the treatment.&nbsp;But due to my&nbsp;official engagemen=\r\nts I was camping at a far off place for around 2 months.&nbsp;Her problem w=\r\nas getting worsened as it&nbsp;had&nbsp; started affecting her professional=\r\n career adversely.

Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those spe=\r\ncific moments from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the exter=\r\nnal consciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never wa=\r\ns any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it c=\r\nannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all ge=\r\nt dissolved and new set is generated based on need.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br c=\r\nlear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They=\r\n believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n the=\r\nir idea of reincarnation\n is very different. It is like an energy stream ma=\r\nde up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to give the impression of an i=\r\nndividual being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the=\r\n greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another for=\r\nmation at a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a diffe=\r\nrent point can coalesce into a different part. &nbsp; Hence it is possible =\r\nfor a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of h=\r\nis energy reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reinca=\r\nrnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy o=\r\nf speech incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in=\r\n another person, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and al=\r\nl these happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind=\r\n of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energ=\r\ny governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandha=\r\nna. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this i=\r\ns to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shu=\r\nnya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence t=\r\nhe tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processe=\r\ns.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was diffe=\r\nrent. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind et=\r\nc - but carried forward from one life to another and the chief aim of human=\r\n evolution was to assist and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. Th=\r\ne soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The gr=\r\neat idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are ex=\r\nactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an =\r\nindividual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; =\r\nA Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only one among m=\r\nany possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; moving into a state \nof complete negation=\r\n/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,\n then there was just n=\r\no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;Th=\r\ne law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of giv=\r\ne and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The importa=\r\nnt thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth =\r\nto the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediatel=\r\ny. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is=\r\n why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can tran=\r\nsform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a=\r\n hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope =\r\nof play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical giv=\r\ne and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv0853806741ms__id1914 yi=\r\nv0853806741ms__id664&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:times new rom=\r\nan, new york, times, serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;background-colo=\r\nr:transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv0853=\r\n806741ms__id1915 yiv0853806741ms__id665&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-f=\r\namily:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:16px;font-style:nor=\r\nmal;background-color:transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembe=\r\nrs and everything else being perishable, the only indestructible link betwe=\r\nen past life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will be re=\r\ncalled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollection.
