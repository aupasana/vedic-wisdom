More learned ones can ign=\r\nore my 2 cents.\n\n* * *\n\nThough I offer this navarna mantra in fire before a=\r\nnd after saptashati everyday\nas a part of my daily Chandi homam, I did not =\r\nhave an attachment to this mantra\nand did not appreciate what it represente=\r\nd. I could appreciate the outward and\ninward meanings of the stories of sap=\r\ntashati, but I was clueless on the navarna\nmantra and was offering it in fi=\r\nre merely ritually. In contrast, I was (and am)\nquite attached to [Savitru]=\r\n Gayatri mantra, meditated with it a lot more, had\nmany experiences with it=\r\n and had a much better understanding of it. Even when\nmeditating at the end=\r\n of Chandi homam as the poornaahuti burnt, I always used\nGayatri mantra rat=\r\nher than navarna mantra.\n\nWhen I was at the Dakshineshwar temple in 2008 su=\r\nmmer with my spiritual guru,\nsomehow I felt a strong urge to meditate with =\r\nthe navarna mantra and did so. The\nMother was kind and I could experience s=\r\nome things and some things became clear\nabout that mantra.\n\nI realized thro=\r\nugh experience that navarna mantra is not that different from\nSavitru Gayat=\r\nri mantra! It is actually a slightly different expression of the\nsame reali=\r\nty, even though this may sound strange to some.\n\n* * *\n\nThose who do homam =\r\nknow the following mantras from the uttaraangam: &quot; OM bhUH\nsvaahaa - agnaya=\r\n idam na mama, OM bhuvH svaahaa - vaayava idam na mama, OM suvaH\nsvaahaa - =\r\nsUryaayedam na mama &quot; . Note that the planes of consciousness\nrepresented b=\r\ny bhUH, bhuvaH and suvaH (physical, mental and spiritual planes or,\nusing a=\r\nlternate terminology, gross, subtle and causal realms) are associated\nwith =\r\nFire (Agni), Wind (Vaayu) and Sun (Surya) gods. After all, it is Fire who\nt=\r\nransforms and transmutes things and enables physical matter to come from\naa=\r\nkaasa (space); it is Wind that causes motion and thoughts in the mind; and,=\r\n it\nis Sun who fills the entire universe and each being in it with the esse=\r\nnce that\nsoul is.\n\nIn Chandipath (i.e. saptashati), we have 3 charitras for=\r\n which Mahakali,\nMahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati are the devatas. The beejas =\r\nassociated with the 3\ncharitras are Aim, Hreem and Kleem respectively. And,=\r\n Agni, Vaayu and Surya are\nmentioned as the tattwa (essence) of the three c=\r\nharitras respectively!\n\nIn other words, the 3 beejas aim, hreem and kleem t=\r\nhat start the navarna mantra\nare associated with Agni, Vaayu and Surya, who=\r\n also represents the realms of\nbhUh, bhuvaH and suvaH. Basically, &quot; aim hre=\r\nem kleem &quot; in navarna mantra similar\nto &quot; om bhurbhuvassuvah &quot; that is usua=\r\nlly appended to the Gayatri mantra.\n\nThe word &quot; vid &quot; that is part of &quot; vic=\r\nhche &quot; (vid + cha + ee) is an expression of\n&quot; dhiyo yo nah prachodayat &quot; . =\r\nThe word &quot; ee &quot; that is part of &quot; vichche &quot; is an\nexpression of &quot; bhargo de=\r\nvasya dheemahi &quot; .\n\n* * *\n\nThe difference between navarna mantra and Gayatr=\r\ni mantra is in one way like the\ndifference between Bhagavad Gita and Avadho=\r\nota Gita or Ashtavakra Gita.\n\nAvadhoota Gita by Dattatreya and Ashtavakra G=\r\nita by Ashtavakra (taught to king\nJanaka) are fantastic vedantic texts that=\r\n throw light on the state of a\nliberated being. Bhagavad Gita taught by Sri=\r\n Krishna also does the same thing.\nHowever, the difference is that Bhagavad=\r\n Gita shows practical paths that one can\nfollow in order to be liberated. O=\r\nf course, if you can imbibe the thinking\ndescribed in Avadhoota Gita or Ash=\r\ntavakra Gita also, you can become liberated.\nBut, it is not easy for most p=\r\neople to imbibe that thinking just like that.\nBhagavad Gita shows a more pr=\r\nactical and realistic path.\n\nSimilarly, Gayatri mantra refers to the resple=\r\nndent spiritual essence of the\nentire universe (gross, subtle and causal) a=\r\nnd asks us to know it and be\nestablished in it. Navarna mantra is also refe=\r\nrring to resplendent spiritual\nessence of the entire universe (gross, subtl=\r\ne and causal) and asking us to know\nit and be established in its resplenden=\r\nce. But, in addition, it is giving us a\nrealistic path (chaamundaayai) to a=\r\nchieving such a state of sat-chid-aananda\nfrom the deeply dual state that w=\r\ne are in. Except for that additional\nrecognition of deep duality and showin=\r\ng a path towards realization, it basically\nexpresses the same realization c=\r\naptured in the Gayatri mantra.\n\n* * *\n\nTo answer the specific question on w=\r\nhich deity this navarna mantra is for, my\nanswer is that it is for the root=\r\n energy (aadyaa shakti) of this universe, that\nmakes every being - includin=\r\ng Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - be, have desires,\nthink, know, act etc. This r=\r\noot energy is essentially the Shakti of the Supreme\nCosmic Being (Parama Pu=\r\nrusha). In saptashati rahasya, She is described thus:\n\nsarvasyaadyaa mahaal=\r\nakShmIstriguNaa parameshvarI\nlakShyaalakShya svarUpaa saa vyaapya kR^itsnam=\r\n vyavasthitaa\nmaatulungam gadaam kheTam paanapaatram cha bibhratI\nnaagaM li=\r\nMgaM cha yonim cha bibhratI nR^ipamUrdhani\ntapta kaaMchana varNaabhaa tapta=\r\n kaaMchana bhUShaNaa\nshUnyam tadakhilam svena pUrayaamaasa tejasaa\n\nThis de=\r\nscribes that Mahalakshmi of 3 gunas was the first of all beings and\nsupreme=\r\n of all beings. She filled the entire universe with Her shakti. The\nrahasya=\r\n further describes that She divided Herself into 3 deities - Mahaakaali,\nMa=\r\nhaalakshmi and Mahaasaraswati - symbolizing the 3 gunas. They then created\n=\r\nBrahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts.\n\nOf course, one can question whet=\r\nher this aadyaa shakti is the first of all\nbeings as the verse above says o=\r\nr whether it should be Parama Purusha that is\nthe first of all beings. The =\r\nanswer is that they are not actually two different\nbeings, even though we t=\r\nend to look at them that way. It is the Aadyaa shakti\nthat makes Parama Pur=\r\nusha (or Aadya purusha) be, think, desire, know and act.\nWithout Aadyaa sha=\r\nkti, Aadya purusha has no thoughts, no desires, no knowledge\nand no action,=\r\n i.e. he is non-different from unmanifested Brahman. His very\nself-awarenes=\r\ns is through Aadyaa shakti, just as my self-awareness is through my\nKundali=\r\nni.\n\nThus, Aadyaa shakti and Parama purusha are not really two different be=\r\nings, but\ntwo different aspects of one being. Narayana and Narayani are one=\r\n.\n\n* * *\n\nOne word on intellectual analysis of mantras:\n\nOne can get only a=\r\n very limited understanding of mantras by analyzing them and\nunderstanding =\r\nthem intellectually. One can realize and understand the nature of\na mantra =\r\nthrough an internal experience of the mantra. One should focus the mind\nso =\r\ncompletely on the mantra that one&#39;s mind is eventually withdrawn from\nevery=\r\nthing else, including one&#39;s body and sense inputs, and reverberates with\nth=\r\ne mantra with absolutely no other thoughts running in the mind. When the\nma=\r\nntra *fills* one&#39;s mind like this, one experiences and understands the mant=\r\nra.\n\nIf you want to experience a mantra, try to focus your mind on the mant=\r\nra and\nforget everything else. Even several notions you may have in your mi=\r\nnd about the\nmantra and its deity may become blockages. Just forget everyth=\r\ning and focus the\nmind on mantra alone.\n\nIf you spend your time contemplati=\r\nng your own actions and motivations behind\nthem and try to root out ego whe=\r\nnever it raises its head in your mind, it will\nbe helpful. I do not mean pr=\r\nide by ego here and mean self-identification with a\nbody and a name. As lon=\r\ng as such an identification is strong, it prevents one\nfrom being able to f=\r\nocus fully on a mantra. A person with no or very subtle ego\nis far more lik=\r\nely to be able to achieve what I mentioned above, than a person\nwith a dens=\r\ne ego.\n\nWhen contemplation and attitude correction go in parallel to medita=\r\ntion, the two\nactivities enhance the effectiveness of the other and eventua=\r\nlly one breaks\nthrough and succeeds in lowering ego and starts to experienc=\r\ne subtler and higher\nthings. When mind is so pre-occupied with body, name e=\r\ntc, it cannot experience\nsubtler things that well.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; So you will fi=\r\nnd the more samhara rupas, that is tamasik,\n&gt; raudra forms of Kali, Chamund=\r\na, Shivaduti under the essence\n&gt; of Mahasaraswati, whereas the Mahakali rup=\r\na is beautiful;\n&gt; like Dakshina Kali.\n\n:-) Beauty is in the eye of the beho=\r\nlder. To a devotee of Smashaana Kaali, She\nmay be the most beautiful.\n\nBest=\r\n regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam=\r\n\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritu=\r\nality: vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comc=\r\nast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n\n\n"}}
