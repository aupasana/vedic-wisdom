I g=\r\net very emotional whenever I hear a great song/ name of the devi or see an =\r\nendearing image of the mother. I have to stop my tears with great effort in=\r\n such situiations. This does not happen with any other God /deity .\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nIt could be that you have a connection with Devi from some life time. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nDoes this mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to me ? Or is it just m=\r\ny mind at working overtime. \n=C2=A0\nEven if it is your mind, the feeling gi=\r\nves you intense happiness. You can&#39;t reject the happiness. Can you? If you =\r\nfeel that you can and should do worship of Devi, then do it. Don&#39;t worry ab=\r\nout the pros and cons of whether it is suitable or not suitable. Just do it=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThat seems to be some time away considering that its an exh=\r\naustive script. While I continue to work on this path, I wanted to do some =\r\nkind of homam for the devi in the mean time.\n=C2=A0\nKeep trying to get fami=\r\nliar with the text as much as you can. This may take time. Different people=\r\n depending on their samskaras may take different amount of time to be comfo=\r\nrtable with the text. One person I know (Narayan Iyer)=C2=A0who was not flu=\r\nent in devnagri script took more than 10 hours to do the first Chandi homa.=\r\n He had fantastic determination.

The Devi Stutis. Narasimha had mentio=\r\nned this once in this forum. While trying to familiarize yourself with the =\r\ntext, start with chapter 2/3/4. Once you are comfortable with it, then read=\r\n 2/3/4 and 1. Once you are comfortable with that, then read 2/3/4/1/5. If y=\r\nou can do the first five chapter, the rest will follow. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nCan =\r\nI use some other mantras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra &quot;om ai=C3=A0 hr=\r\n=C3=A9=C3=A0 kl=C3=A9=C3=A0 c=C3=A4mu=C3=AB=C3=B2=C3=A4yai vicce&quot; .\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nSure. However understand that a Chandi homa is homa of the 13 chapters. In =\r\nparts of West Bengal many people often claim to do Chandi homas but all the=\r\ny end up doing is ahutis of only the Navarna Mantra. That - in my opinion -=\r\n is NOT=C2=A0a Chandi homa. \n=C2=A0\nAlternatively can I perform the homam u=\r\nsing the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know the procedure if I am using just=\r\n the Durga suktam for performing the homam.\n=C2=A0\nThe Durga Suktam is a Ve=\r\ndic Suktam. The pronunciation is a key here. But why not start with a Chapt=\r\ner from teh actual Shaptasati for homa.
