My primary motivation in doing Homam is the good feeling that some of my=\r\n time is well spent, and I dont have any goals as such. Is that a good atti=\r\ntude while doing Homam?. Also I dont have sacred thread, Narsimha Sir, can =\r\nI think of you as my Guru and perform Homam?\n   \n   Thanks\n   Phani\n\n\n\n  20=\r\n08/12/4 Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n\n    Namaste Phani,\n\n\n    &gt; 1)C=\r\nan Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors)? Can a homam\n   =\r\n &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a=\r\n\n    &gt; copper one?\n\n\n    Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the o=\r\npen is actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a ra=\r\nin can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it ra=\r\nins while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by ra=\r\nin in the middle of a homam.\n\n    Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with=\r\n bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n\n\n    &gt; 2)W=\r\nhile performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the\n =\r\n   &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n\n\n    One can repeat mentally w=\r\nhile listening attentively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mant=\r\nras with all the attention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n\n    S=\r\nuppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in=\r\n the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of t=\r\nhe mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and ye=\r\nt person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that pro=\r\ntects the mind&quot;. One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protecte=\r\nd. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the man=\r\ntra.\n\n    However, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mant=\r\nra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in t=\r\nhe external fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (even if=\r\n feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listening. Tr=\r\ny to repeat slowly.\n\n\n    &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Oth=\r\ner conditions/niyamas that\n    &gt; should be followed apart from having veget=\r\nerain food?\n\n\n    Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) ha=\r\ns been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n\n    One sho=\r\nuld follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s gu=\r\nru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one should eat on=\r\nly vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before homam. Anothe=\r\nr rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before ho=\r\nmam.\n\n    By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for =\r\nspiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and allow them to d=\r\no it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru and perform homam. I=\r\n am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process until the person c=\r\nrosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam and other spiritual =\r\npractices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropade=\r\nsa, it does not matter after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold =\r\nof purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to spee=\r\nd this up and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n\n    As long =\r\nas one desires no specific material benefits (and ready to receive whatever=\r\n god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to help, ev=\r\nen if it means some suffering for me.\n\n\n    &gt; 4)Any good date to start the =\r\nHomam? or any day would be fine?\n\n\n    For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is=\r\n a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.\n\n    *        *        *\n=\r\n\n    Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.\n\n    W=\r\nhen I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to =\r\nseveral places (on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morn=\r\ning in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me =\r\nto carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in June/July in India, =\r\nI did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded =\r\nto the rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish t=\r\nold me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after our homa=\r\nm finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n\n    To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our=\r\n homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining =\r\nwith really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the roof=\r\ntop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas, =\r\nclosed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas u=\r\nntil fire in the two homa kundas went off and then packed everything and we=\r\nnt down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told that a he=\r\navy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us o=\r\nn that trip as we covered the north, east and west of India. It rained in e=\r\nvery place we went to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared t=\r\no move on.\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    ---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n    Do a Short Homam Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n    Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comca=\r\nst.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n    ---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    ---- =\r\nPhanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@...&gt; wrote:\n    &gt; Namasthe,\n    &gt;\n  =\r\n  &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few questi=\r\nons\n    &gt; regarding it.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof to=\r\np of a house(3-floors)?

I am willing to take on any karma incurred \n    in the process until=\r\n the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n    through homam an=\r\nd other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred \n    thread, mantro=\r\npadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, \n    when the =\r\nperson crosses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and \n    othe=\r\nr mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the \n =\r\n   threshhold of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As long as one desires no specific material=\r\n \n    benefits (and ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for=\r\n \n    spiritual progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffe=\r\nring \n    for me.&lt;BR&gt;\n    &lt;DIV class=3DIh2E3d&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4)Any good date to s=\r\ntart the Homam? or any day \n    would be fine?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;For Mahaganapat=\r\nhi homam, the best is a Chaturthi \n    morning. But any day is fine really.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* \n    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mentioning rain and rooftop homam \n    reminded me of my India trip.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I went to India in May 2008, I and \n    my guru Manish traveled =\r\ntogether to several places (on a specific project). \n    We ended up doing =\r\nhomam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). \n    Before the =\r\ntrip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons \n    come o=\r\nnly in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New \n   =\r\n Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex we =\r\n\n    were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rai=\r\nn \n    heavily in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;To my \n    surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we =\r\noffered \n    poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big drops=\r\n. Luckily, \n    there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close to us.=\r\n Together, we \n    held it on top of the two small homa kundas, closed our =\r\neyes and meditated. \n    We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas until f=\r\nire in the two homa kundas \n    went off and then packed everything and wen=\r\nt down. We left for Kurukshetra \n    later that day, but we were told that =\r\na heavy rain continued for a few days \n    in New Delhi. In fact, rain foll=\r\nowed us on that trip as we covered the \n    north, east and west of India. =\r\nIt rained in every place we went to, as we \n    finished our task in that p=\r\nlace and prepared to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n    regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Do \n    =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; \n =\r\n   target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas \n    Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n  =\r\n  target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spiritualit=\r\ny: &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; \n    target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish \n =\r\n   lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot; \n    targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish \n    soft=\r\nware (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; \n    target=3D_b=\r\nlank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre \n    (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot; \n    target=3D_blank&gt;http:=\r\n//www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------&lt;BR&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV class=3DWj3C7c&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- Phanik=\r\numar Velaga &lt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;mailto:itsverysimple@...&quot;&gt;itsverysimp=\r\nle@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; \n    wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namasthe,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am int=\r\nerested in doing Maha \n    Ganapati Homam daily, and have few questions&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; regarding \n    it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roo=\r\nf top of a \n    house(3-floors)?
