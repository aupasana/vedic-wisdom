His desires are \nthe sum total of the desires of all beings. His actions are the sum total of \nthe actions of all beings. His knowledge are the sum total of the knowledge \nof all beings. Thus, anything that is happening through the individual will \nof a single being is also happening with the will of supreme cosmic being. \nThe statement &quot;nothing in this world moves without the will of God&quot; is take \nthe supreme cosmic being as God.\n\nA demon like Raavana conquering the world happens through his individual \nwill and actions, which is part of the will and actions of suppreme cosmic \nbeing. But this makes gods and rishis unhappy and Lord Vishnu decides to \nkill him. This decision of Vishnu&#39;s avatara as Rama and its execution \nhappens through the will and actions of Lord Vishnu, which is part of the \nwill and actions of supreme cosmic being. This is the karmaphala of \nRaavana&#39;s actions, given by Nature through gods, rishis and Vishnu. A demon \nbecoming strong and abusing gods and Vishnu killing him are both due to the \nwill of supreme cosmic being.\n\nThough every action is indeed due to the will of god, that is a generic and \n1000 ft high view. A better view would be to look at it as the will of a \nspecific being, who will get a corresponding karma phala (reaction) in \nfuture from another being. The action and reaction are all happening due to \nthe will of god (supreme cosmic being).\n\nIf X murders Y, it is the will of X that is responsible for it. Though it is \nalso due to the will of supreme cosmic being, a more useful way to look at \nit is as the will of X.\n\nOf course, will of Y may be responsible for some adharmik actions in the \npast and the reaction given by nature may be his murder (with X being the \ninstrument of this reaction). When Y committed those actions in the past, it \nwas due to his will and hence also due to the will of supreme cosmic being \n(as Y is part of supreme cosmic being). Then X is used by nature as an \ninstrument to murder Y, so that he gets the reaction of his action. This \nhappens due to the will of X and also due to the will of god as X is a part \nof supreme cosmic being.\n\nHowever, if X does this action with self-identification, this becomes a new \nkarma for him. He will get its reaction later and nature will use someone \nelse (or Y himself) as an instrument. This is an endless cycle until one \nrealizes that what is happening to one is a reaction to one&#39;s own previous \nactions and does not harbor emotions like hatred, anger, jealosy etc towards \npeople and objects used as instruments by nature to bring reactions to one&#39;s \nprevious actions.\n\nSimilarly, when many people who engaged in some bad actions using their free \nwill (and hence also god&#39;s will) are together, nature may decide to give \nthem the reaction to their actions together. A natural or man-made disaster \n(like a tsunami or earthquake or a terrorist attack) may come to all of them \nand give the reaction to their bad actions from the past. This is happening \nas a result of their own actions.\n\nAll actions of all beings and the reactions given to them by the nature are \ndue to the will of supreme cosmic being. It is very difficult to understand \nsupreme cosmic being.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;murahariv&quot; &lt;murahariv@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 2:57 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: need your clarifications about \nGod/astrology/society\n\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; For the past few days, few questions as listed below are confusing\n&gt; me. Hoping to get this blockages cleared from learned gurus.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----\n&gt; &quot;Nothing in this world moves without the will of God&quot;\n&gt; -----\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I can understand this with regard to action/reaction philosophy\n&gt; but with regard to free will, how do we interpret the above\n&gt; statement? e.g., murdering innocent people is an action done by\n&gt; one&#39;s free will (agami karma) How to understand this &quot;murder&quot;\n&gt; incident with the &quot;Will of God&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. How to understand/interpret the &quot;will of God&quot; in a natural\n&gt; catastrophe kind of situation ? (E.g., Tsumani disaster or\n&gt; EarthQuake disaster, leading to mass deaths of hundreds of lives?)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks & Regards,\n&gt; --Murahari\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Madam,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It took a while to get to your mail. I am cc&#39;ing the reply to some\n&gt; yahoogroups interested in spirituality, while ensuring your\n&gt; anonymity.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A lot of philosophical questions can be answered in multiple ways.\n&gt; There is no single correct answer. The answer appropriate for one\n&gt; person is inappropriate for another. If I say &quot;God is the doer of\n&gt; all things. When Arjuna killed his gurus and elders, actually God\n&gt; did it through him&quot;, a lesser person may imitate it and that will be\n&gt; unfortunate. But that will be a very appropriate point to make to a\n&gt; more elevated person who still has a sense of ownership over his\n&gt; actions and need to give it up.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, one cannot answer questions such as yours without\n&gt; understanding the current spiritual level of the asking person.\n&gt; Otherwise the answer will be utterly useless. I will go by my gut\n&gt; and answer the way I think will be useful to you and some others on\n&gt; the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1. God created human beings and other beings so that there is some\n&gt; commotion in the Atman (cosmic soul). If there is no different\n&gt; beings with different qualities, the whole universe will be filled\n&gt; with Atman (cosmic soul). That too happens for a while. But, at\n&gt; other times, various beings with various qualities are created. An\n&gt; ocean may be still for a while and give rise to a lot of waves for a\n&gt; while. If cosmic soul is like an ocean, various beings are like\n&gt; waves in the ocean.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2. God decides based on the cumulative good/bad of all your\n&gt; previous actions and wishes over all your lives so far. If you have\n&gt; good tendencies, it is because of good actions and wishes in the\n&gt; past. If you have bad tendencies, it is because of bad actions and\n&gt; wishes in the past. All you can do is to engage in good actions and\n&gt; have good wishes. That will keep you in good stead in future.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3. Your own free will!!!! That is why now you have to pay for it.\n&gt; Nature works on the principle of &quot;equal reaction to every action&quot;.\n&gt; You engaged in an action using your own free will and nature has to\n&gt; somehow find a way to give the equal reaction to that action. God is\n&gt; there to implement the rules of nature.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The circumstances faced by you are decides by nature based on the\n&gt; previous actions exerted by your free will. Within the limitations\n&gt; imposed by those circumstances, your free will decides one\n&gt; particular action among several possible actions. That gets added to\n&gt; the list of your actions and nature pays back for it in future by\n&gt; creating different circumstances for you to operate under.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 4. There is a duality and singularity. In the world of\n&gt; singularity, there is one god - the cosmic being. Gods and demons,\n&gt; good and bad, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, intelligence and\n&gt; foolishness, happiness and sadness, knowledge and ignorance, punya\n&gt; and sin - all are nothing but this singular god. There is nothing\n&gt; but that singular god. That singular god lives in all of us, in each\n&gt; molecule, atom and sub-atomic particle of this universe. The entire\n&gt; core of our being is filled with this singular god.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When the same world is seen through the lense of duality, this\n&gt; singular god manifests as different entities. In the world of\n&gt; duality, there are various gods engaged in various good roles and\n&gt; various demons engaged in various bad roles. There is always a\n&gt; tussle between them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now again, all these gods and demons engaged in various good and\n&gt; bad roles exist within us in a microcosmic form. The Brihaspati\n&gt; (teacher of gods) within us (i.e. our intelligence and discretion)\n&gt; tells the gods within us (various good qualities) what to do and\n&gt; works for their victory. Various gods and demons discharge their\n&gt; roles. But the result varies.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If a person&#39;s spiritual evolution is like that of the world when\n&gt; Ravana was ruling earth, then the demons inside the person will be\n&gt; dominating over the gods and gods go into hiding within that person.\n&gt; He will engage in sins. If a person&#39;s spiritual evolution is like\n&gt; that of the world when Rama killed Ravana and ruled earth in peace\n&gt; and prosperity, then the gods inside that person will be dominating\n&gt; over the demons. Ge will engage in good deeds. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, realize that there are gods and demons inside us and there is\n&gt; a constant tussle between them. The good thing is that gods are\n&gt; amara, i.e. immortal. They can be weak and defeated, but they never\n&gt; completely die. Demons can die, gods can never die. They may be\n&gt; defeated, but they live on and overcome demons oneday!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If someone tells you &quot;there is only one god and he is in all of\n&gt; us&quot;, realize that this refers to the singular god I described\n&gt; earlier. With that god, there is no distinction between good and\n&gt; bad. The distinction comes with gods of duality. The moment you talk\n&gt; of duality, gods and demons are both there and there is a tussle.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 5. God is simply doing his job. Nature is based on the rule of\n&gt; equal reaction to one&#39;s actions and God impassionately implements\n&gt; that rule. If one was really cruel to somebody else and killed\n&gt; cruelly, nature will have to find a way to give an equal reaction.\n&gt; It is sad, but that is how nature works!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 6. The previous karmas and rinas to various people decide the give\n&gt; and take in this life. The relations in this life may be relations\n&gt; in the past life too (but the exact relationship may be different).\n&gt; If you harassed a particular person in the last life, nature may\n&gt; provide an opportunity for that person to harass you now.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again, if nature is placing you in a difficult circumstance where\n&gt; someone is harassing you and making life difficult, it is not\n&gt; because nature hates you or god hates you. It is because you did\n&gt; exactly the same thing to someone else previously. Nature is paying\n&gt; back.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The goal of this &quot;pay back game&quot; of nature is that after a big\n&gt; cycle of actions and equal reactions, one understands how nature\n&gt; works and manages to leave the game! When all the players leave the\n&gt; game, the game will end. Until then, the game will go on...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 7. As more and more people engage in more and more sinful\n&gt; behavior, this creates of a spiral of adharma. That increases the\n&gt; negative quality of time in general and leads to more and more\n&gt; people engaging in adharma. It is a spiral.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, we are in Kali yuga and adharma will only increase\n&gt; in the long run. But, by engaging in good actions of great\n&gt; magnitude, we can create positive energy and slow down this spiral\n&gt; of adharma.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is good that you worry about those who suffer. That compassion\n&gt; is great. But that compassion alone is not sufficient. Instead, if\n&gt; you and others engage in good actions and create a positive energy\n&gt; of great magnitude in the world, that can be helpful. If ten\n&gt; thousand people are performing a homam every morning, trying to\n&gt; transform their attitude to that of surrender to god and limited\n&gt; ego, that can really transform the world atleast for a few decades\n&gt; and centuries.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do homam, do meditation, read good books, have good company,\n&gt; discuss spiritual matters (instead of wasting time on meaningless\n&gt; entertainment), think of god, try to understand the ways of god,\n&gt; lessen pride and ego, try to do your best in each action without\n&gt; much attachment, analyze each of your own actions and correct the\n&gt; internal attitude. If you keep up like this and several others do,\n&gt; the problems you mentioned can see some relief.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Dear sir,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   This is &lt;deleted&gt; from &lt;deleted&gt;. I came to know about you from\n&gt; my husband &lt;deleted&gt;.\n&gt;&gt;   He has told about you a lot and i have read your\n&gt; mails ..ganapathi homam,\n&gt;&gt;   vedic explanations etc.,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   I wish you will help me to have clear ideas about some of my\n&gt; basic questions.\n&gt;&gt;   Always I ask some questions to myself.Even myself and my husband\n&gt; will discuss\n&gt;&gt;   regarding this. But we both unable to find out the answer. They\n&gt; are,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   1. My first question is why God created human beings?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   2. When God is creating all the human beings,we are all God&#39;s\n&gt; children.\n&gt;&gt;   Then why he is differntiating some people are good, some are\n&gt; bad? On what basis he\n&gt;&gt;   is deciding that &quot;this person will have good habits in his life\n&gt; time and that person will have\n&gt;&gt;   all bad habits? &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   3.Some of the astrologers say to me, whatever\n&gt; problems/sufferings etc., we are facing in\n&gt;&gt;   this life time is due to our previous karma.ie.,we have done\n&gt; some sin to others in our\n&gt;&gt;   previous birth.Who induced us to do sin in our previous birth to\n&gt; others?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   4. Some people say, God is inside us. When God is inside us, why\n&gt; people are doing sin to\n&gt;&gt;   others? If they are doing, why God is not correcting them??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   5.Nowadays, they are so many accidents happening in the city.\n&gt; Painful deaths are\n&gt;&gt;   happening which cannot be digested / make us sleepless for\n&gt; nights together. Why God\n&gt;&gt;   is giving these type of painful death to people? why he is so\n&gt; cruel?People say the person\n&gt;&gt;   who died might have made sin to others in last birth. For that,\n&gt; this kind of cruelty is required?\n&gt;&gt;   Why God is not giving peaceful death??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   6. My another question is regarding family issues. Most of the\n&gt; daughter-in-law suffer becos\n&gt;&gt;   of her Mother-in-law/Father-in-law/Sister-in-law and Husbands or\n&gt; vice versa. I have come across\n&gt;&gt;   so many families like this.If daughter in law is tortured from\n&gt; her husband&#39;s family, is it due\n&gt;&gt;   to her horoscope or due to society. If it is due to her\n&gt; horoscope, its the same answer that\n&gt;&gt;   its her karma. Why her karma is written like that? why she\n&gt; should suffer in her life?? Who has\n&gt;&gt;   made her to suffer like this(even if she is of good\n&gt; character/good habits)??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   7. Nowadays, it is becoming very unsafe for ladies in the\n&gt; society. Some girls are getting\n&gt;&gt;   exploited and some knowingly going in the wrong way making a\n&gt; mind set that nothing is\n&gt;&gt;   wrong. Why society has developed like this??When God has created\n&gt; the world, why he is\n&gt;&gt;   allowing it to go worse? What will be the future of the\n&gt; youngsters? whether we can bring\n&gt;&gt;   up our children with good habits? I feel its very difficult..All\n&gt; these things related to astrology?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Kindly bear with my long mail and guide me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Thanks/Regards,\n&gt;&gt;   &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
