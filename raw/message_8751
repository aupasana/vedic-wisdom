Spirituality on the other hand is e=\r\nxperiential. One can sit in an armchair and contemplate on philosophy, but =\r\nthe same is not possible in case of spirituality. These two are different. =\r\nPhilosophy gives a logical framework of understanding something. There coul=\r\nd be philosophy of science, a philosophy of ethics, a philosophy of spiritu=\r\nality, a philosophy of epistemology (the investigations into the process of=\r\n acquiring knowledge) etc.\n\nThat Sri Adi Shankara was a fantastic spiritual=\r\n giant, I have no doubt (which I have already stated in my previous email. =\r\nVibhuti of God). I am also sure that the very presence of such a man of suc=\r\nh spiritual stature would have naturally drawn masses towards him.=C2=A0 It=\r\n happens with all great personalities. They have a magnetism which extends =\r\nway beyond after their death.\n\nHowever, to understand, appreciate, criticiz=\r\ne, debate, analyses, comparatively-evaluate any philosophy of any individua=\r\nl is not that difficult and is a valid rational process. \n\nWhile future is =\r\nalways uncertain, but chances look remote for me that I would find Mayavada=\r\n more attractive. It was Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Mayavada - as is understood and=\r\n propagated by his followers - which I had studied when I was first trying =\r\nto get a grasp of Hindu philosophy. It a nice, compact and easily understan=\r\ndable philosophy. Possibly one the chief reasons why most=C2=A0 intellectua=\r\nls like his Adwaitha apart from being attracted by his personality. It is e=\r\nasier to debate from Sri Shankara&#39;s stand-point. At that time I liked it. L=\r\nater as I got acquainted myself with more varieties of Hindu philosophy, I =\r\nfound others more comprehensive and covering more essential points and usin=\r\ng a very, if I may use this phrase, a bottom-up approach to understanding r=\r\neality, while Sri Shankara&#39;s philosophy is a very top-down approach, with a=\r\n greater thrust on the top and an indeterminate leftover in the bottom. Sha=\r\nnkara&#39;s Adwaitha, Ramanujacharya&#39;s Visistha-adwaitha,\n Vallavacharya&#39;s Sudd=\r\nha Adwaitha - so many varieties of philosophy.\n\nI have a personal view abou=\r\nt judging philosophy. For everything that one giant has said, there is alwa=\r\nys another one who has said exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one=\r\n who came up with a different view-point, differing with all the previous o=\r\nnes. And each of these giants have spoken with the utmost conviction of the=\r\nir own realizations of truths. So personality and stature of the philosophe=\r\nr should play no role in an objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like=\r\n the personality and stature of a mathematician is of no use in=C2=A0 judgi=\r\nng the correctness of a mathematical theory.=C2=A0 Spiritually, the reality=\r\n is same (and it maybe a very complex reality). But philosophically each ha=\r\nve differences which cannot the ignored. In such an intellectual climate, i=\r\nn my personal opinion, it is fair enough to discard one philosophy for anot=\r\nher, after a thorough and detailed contemplation of the pros and cons.\n\nFro=\r\nm a spiritual view-point all this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spirit=\r\nual giant one chooses to hang on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort=\r\n is engaged, surely progress will happen in time. But philosophy is a anoth=\r\ner matter.\n\n[To make my stand clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by=\r\n some strange miracle of God, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infor=\r\nnt of me, I would have no qualms about falling at his feet and bowing down =\r\nto him and asking for his blessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestio=\r\nnable. Yet I will still not be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated du=\r\nring the time he lived.]\n\n-Best Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimAp=\r\nannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[=\r\n7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Thursday, 11 October 201=\r\n2 10:32 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Rajarshi,\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nactually =\r\n&quot;rejecting&quot; may not be the right word you probably mistakenly used.

I hope your health is fine too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will answer the points you have=\r\n raised in your mail below, to the best of my ability. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; So =\r\nis there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or Grace or Protection in y=\r\nour theory. Is=C3=82=C2=A0this intermediate zone as you say is created by H=\r\ner \n&gt; and part of Her creation=C3=82=C2=A0or by=C3=82=C2=A0somebody else. &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no other somebody else in the Universe apart from Her. Even=\r\n the worst Asura is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons on=\r\nly She knows, because Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpes=\r\nt human mind. Nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She =\r\nis truly the One whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She li=\r\nes hidden inside it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discover=\r\ned, extending Her love, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who cal=\r\nls Her sincerely and unconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liber=\r\nty to act as per its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the a=\r\npparently bad. \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;Does=C3=82=C2=A0She needs some visa \n&gt; to go there i=\r\nf she is=C3=82=C2=A0not the Creater.=C3=82=C2=A0As you say all higher deity=\r\n are \n&gt; there but less in ability. Does the deities have even less =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0ability on \n&gt; earth plane.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; She needs no visa, but neither does=\r\n She interfere without a genuine cause or a genuine call. Everything is Her=\r\n world, then why is there ugliness, crime, evil things? Who creates the Asu=\r\nras, if not She? And it is She herself who gave them the liberty to act as =\r\nper their freewill. This world is a play of forces and a democracy of oppor=\r\ntunities. Every impulse, however Divine or anti-Divine in aim, is given a c=\r\nhance to run its course and actualize itself in the Universe. THAT is Her D=\r\nivine Compassion! That is why She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to =\r\nthe Great Gods as much to the Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas=\r\n and Pretas and other corrupt human being and what not. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now coming to=\r\n your question on the phrase &quot;higher deities having less ability&quot;. I think =\r\nI have not been able to explain clearly, since in the last mail I was merel=\r\ny writing in the context of that discussion. Let me try here.\n&gt; \n&gt; There ar=\r\ne three basic layer of this Universe. The physical, the astral or subtle la=\r\nyer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, which lies =\r\nsuperimposed on our own physical plane, there is a whole wide world of all =\r\npossible forces, just like in our own world. It is a layer which is created=\r\n out of force of pranashakti. This force of pranashakti in humans beings is=\r\n what causes all emotive movements on the consciousness - joy, happiness, l=\r\nove, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachments etc etc=\r\n. These are also capable of influencing the thinking mind is us. Now the co=\r\nre philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik sadhana, is to create a form=\r\nation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated =\r\nrituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you think carefully, you will re=\r\nalize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual bef=\r\nore starting. The sadhaka used the force of his/her own\n&gt;  pranashakti to i=\r\nnfuse life into a subtle formation of the deity. Once this process is succe=\r\nssfully done, this sublte formation of the deity which exists in the subtle=\r\n plane, has a life of its own. It can then guide the sadhaka through the pa=\r\nth and eventually, one day lead him/her to the real abode of the deity whic=\r\nh is the karana-jagat (beyond this astral plane). If a person is able to aw=\r\naken his/her Kundalini shakti, and make it identify/create such an astral f=\r\normation of the deity, it becomes an even more powerful force. It is, from =\r\nour limited human perspective, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine,=\r\n yet it is often not the actual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been =\r\ndescribed by Sri Vimalananda in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; When a sadhaka has been able to associate with such an astr=\r\nal formation of the deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided=\r\n the sadhaka also is trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the causal =\r\nplanes (the real spiritual planes of existence where the real force of the =\r\nDeity originates). The difference, if you ask, between this astral formatio=\r\nn of the deity and the real deity is that, the former is neither bound nor =\r\ncapable by itself of causing a complete and total transformation of the ave=\r\nrage human nature without a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one =\r\nreaches the plane of the Great Gods, which is where the real deity exists, =\r\none cannot avoid being transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what ki=\r\nnd of a transformation will it be? One that will reflect to the world as a =\r\ngreater and genuine humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL =\r\ntime and unfailingly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust, =\r\nanger,\n&gt;  jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachmen=\r\nt, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the consciousness=\r\n. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to another person,=\r\n will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which will automatical=\r\nly calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the=\r\n authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the great deities=\r\n. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the causal planes of=\r\n existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which is created by=\r\n the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often =\r\nnot capable of affecting this kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka. =\r\nThat is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can&#39;t=C3=82=C2=A0 g=\r\net me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or bring me fam=\r\ne or any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral formations of=\r\n the\n deities\n&gt;  can very easily do all these things in the physical world =\r\n- but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the must authentic=\r\n and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one aim and destinat=\r\nion of all genuine sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since this astral plane is the way it is, =\r\ntherefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep actively working on ourselves to=\r\n increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surrender (when that ha=\r\nppens one accepts all life-situations without the slightest grudge), humili=\r\nty, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is universally accepted=\r\n as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are affected at least to=\r\n some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, one is simply not rea=\r\ndy to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from them spiritually. Mor=\r\neover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a gap between experie=\r\nnce and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lead to realization. O=\r\nne off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it fritters away, o=\r\nr worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioning of the sadhaka.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your \n&gt; theory. You have taken it from yogi Au=\r\nrobindo. Many times when certain \n&gt; person reach a stage in their spiritual=\r\n path, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=C3=82=C2=A0complete tr=\r\nuth, when in fact it is=C3=82=C2=A0far from truth. \n&gt; Once=C3=82=C2=A0I saw=\r\n in a article that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who spoke \n&gt; Gita comple=\r\ntely forgot it after few minutes or so. I could not believe \n&gt; what I was r=\r\neading. Then my respect for this yogi went down the drain.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You suret=\r\ny is incorrect. There were certain events which happened in the last one an=\r\nd half years which made me sit down and rethink my own understanding of spi=\r\nrituality. At about the same time I started worshiping a specific personali=\r\nty of the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, the more would th=\r\noughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is imperfect=\r\n and has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find out what =\r\nwas wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking. First q=\r\nuestion I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mind could =\r\ngrasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and truths. But it was=\r\n still not exceptionally clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had first read Sri Aurobindo when I =\r\nwas in college. I could not go beyond the first two pages. They were bounce=\r\nrs going one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gave me a book of S=\r\nri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and rest I rejected, partl=\r\ny due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arrogance. Never opened any o=\r\nf his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana was going on and as I wa=\r\ns instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my understanding, one day wh=\r\nile meditating I had an inner thought in the form of an image, which told m=\r\ne that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very specific manner. =\r\nThe image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly pressing on my con=\r\nsciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in the prescribed manner a=\r\nnd this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was struggling to underst=\r\nand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get a proper hang of=\r\n, I was able to understand\n&gt;  from his writings with much deeper clarity.=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more sense to me. Many sentenc=\r\nes of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new light. I read 40 - 45 % of=\r\n his writings. Then something in me told me to stop at a certain point of h=\r\nis writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I will have to first make m=\r\nore spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational mind will distort the inform=\r\nation. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firmly 3 years ago, now came ba=\r\nck to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun. \n&gt; \n&gt; The line that you m=\r\nention, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Aurobindo on the histori=\r\ncal problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, there is an incident whi=\r\nch comes later on, after the great war and when Yudhisthira was ruling the =\r\nkingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repeat the words he had sp=\r\noken at the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more since he has forgotte=\r\nn them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed away (it was a special ti=\r\nme when the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; once again=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda =\r\nwas one of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, f=\r\nor 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appear before him daily and instruct him=\r\n on the various layers of the mind, which he was not aware of till then. Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda had already left his physical body by then. It was in the w=\r\nritings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and right hemisph=\r\nere of the brain and their difference in functionality, and their connectio=\r\nn to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science confirmed the same=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry, to push=\r\ning his own spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (which he d=\r\nescribes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuously by =\r\nthe Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice of Krishna spe=\r\naking to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, =\r\nthe Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. Anyway, my=\r\n point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of spirituality. =\r\nI have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will also be=\r\nnefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, each with their u=\r\nnique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individually try a=\r\nnd find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotional makeup, and =\r\nhelp us to progress on the path. \n&gt; \n&gt; Though I now have a very deep respec=\r\nt for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his critics and h=\r\nis blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood the dept=\r\nh of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a function of their=\r\n own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genuine under=\r\nstanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be understood acc=\r\nurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; Disclaimer--=\r\n-- My thinking is \n&gt; very different due to Darshan and=C3=82=C2=A0Grace of =\r\nDivine Mother & Divine \n&gt; Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agre=\r\ne or follow the \n&gt; leader.Thanks.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I at-least will never feel unhappy=\r\n if you disagree. There are \n&gt; many saints, many philosophies, many paths, =\r\nnot everyone is bound to \n&gt; like every path.=C3=82=C2=A0 Disagreement is pe=\r\nrfectly ok. Because someone \n&gt; disagrees with me or those whom I agree with=\r\n, does not mean I like him \n&gt; any less. I try to keep my=C3=82=C2=A0 emotio=\r\nnal side (where respect, love, \n&gt; dislike, hatred, anger, passions exist) s=\r\neparate from my thinking mind. \n&gt; It is very much possible, through practic=\r\ne, for a man to disassociate \n&gt; his rational-mind from the emotional-mind. =\r\nSo have no fears that your \n&gt; disagreement is going to make me like you any=\r\n less or any more.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with the emotional part of our being is=\r\n that it jumps up at appearances, running ahead to grasp the truth rather t=\r\nhan waiting patiently for the truth to arrive in all its aspects and dimens=\r\nions, and in the process it distorts the truth and then reacts to that dist=\r\norted image. For example, recently in some social forums I posted a comment=\r\n that I found the Tantrik Adwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi Shankara=\r\n&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-selling supp=\r\norters. Immediately some friends of mine on Twitter and otherwise, jumped t=\r\no the false conclusion that I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and tried bes=\r\nt to make me &quot;see the truth&quot; by such grandiose statements that=C3=82=C2=A0 =\r\nShankara is the &#39;final word&#39; on Adwaitha and everything else must be necess=\r\narily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denouncement. Both of which =\r\nare million light-years away from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a sp=\r\necial Vibhuti\n&gt;  (manifestation) of God, that much I am certain. His compos=\r\nitions are so brilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficiently appreciated in words.=\r\n Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy. And because I a=\r\nm not bound to accept his philosophy, does not mean I respect or love him a=\r\nny less than any other great saint.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; If you disrespect a ma=\r\nn, and specially a saint, and then start disliking him too with a passion, =\r\nyou are creating strong negative karmas. But if you can disagree with someo=\r\nne without losing respect or love for the person, in an objective manner, y=\r\nou reap very little karmic effects. That is why Lord Krishna too advices us=\r\n to become more detached in life.\n&gt; \n&gt; In conclusion, Narasimha is totally =\r\ncorrect. Many things cannot be sufficiently expressed in words without caus=\r\ning some distortion.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnant=\r\no mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  =\r\nFrom: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 =\r\nAM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai,\n&gt; How are you doing?

Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameter=\r\ns of judgement is to objectively see what changes are happening in our surf=\r\nace, day-to-day consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, e=\r\ntc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - i=\r\ns VAST. Some of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex s=\r\ntudy in itself. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to an=\r\nalyse and understand these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 Not all experiences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have =\r\nlost themselves in this jungle of experiences, not being able to adequately=\r\n determine which is genuine and which is non-genuine. This is the world of =\r\nastral\n&gt;  plane, driven by the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and p=\r\narts of manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas r=\r\nules by the overlapping influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhis=\r\nthana to anahata. Everything=C3=82=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher dei=\r\nty has a corresponding lesser manifestation in this realm, but limited in a=\r\nbility. Similarly there are endless beings of varies character and hue who =\r\ncan very easily create an expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off th=\r\ne path. They can even fake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in ext=\r\nreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It=\r\n is a whole wide world, the lower extreme of which causes, in a normal huma=\r\nn being, a cementing of a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dream=\r\ns, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothin=\r\ng but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if =\r\nproperly\n&gt;  channalized as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make =\r\none experience Divine Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing =\r\nguide to the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and a=\r\nuthentic only to the extent that it helps to modify and transform your waki=\r\nng surface personality. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of e=\r\nxperiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experienc=\r\nes ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury without substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, which h=\r\nas destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away by the light and sou=\r\nnd of this realm.

A life so transformed and so away f=\r\nrom our average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its=\r\n own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race.

Spiritua=\r\nlity on the other hand is experiential. One can sit in an armchair and cont=\r\nemplate on philosophy, but the same is not possible in case of spirituality=\r\n. These two are different. Philosophy gives a logical framework of understa=\r\nnding something. There could be philosophy of science, a philosophy of ethi=\r\ncs, a philosophy of spirituality, a philosophy of epistemology (the investi=\r\ngations into the process of acquiring knowledge) etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Sri Adi S=\r\nhankara was a fantastic spiritual giant, I have no doubt (which I have alre=\r\nady stated in my previous email. Vibhuti of God). I am also sure that the v=\r\nery presence of such a man of such spiritual stature would have naturally d=\r\nrawn masses towards him.&nbsp; It happens with all great personalities. The=\r\ny have a magnetism which extends\n way beyond after their death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Howe=\r\nver, to understand, appreciate, criticize, debate, analyses, comparatively-=\r\nevaluate any philosophy of any individual is not that difficult and is a va=\r\nlid rational process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While future is always uncertain, but chances=\r\n look remote for me that I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sri =\r\nAdi Shankara&#39;s Mayavada - as is understood and propagated by his followers =\r\n- which I had studied when I was first trying to get a grasp of Hindu philo=\r\nsophy. It a nice, compact and easily understandable philosophy. Possibly on=\r\ne the chief reasons why most&nbsp; intellectuals like his Adwaitha apart fr=\r\nom being attracted by his personality. It is easier to debate from Sri Shan=\r\nkara&#39;s stand-point. At that time I liked it. Later as I got acquainted myse=\r\nlf with more varieties of Hindu philosophy, I found others more comprehensi=\r\nve and covering more essential points and using a very, if I may use this p=\r\nhrase, a bottom-up\n approach to understanding reality, while Sri Shankara&#39;s=\r\n philosophy is a very top-down approach, with a greater thrust on the top a=\r\nnd an indeterminate leftover in the bottom. Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, Ramanujach=\r\narya&#39;s Visistha-adwaitha, Vallavacharya&#39;s Suddha Adwaitha - so many varieti=\r\nes of philosophy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a personal view about judging philosophy. F=\r\nor everything that one giant has said, there is always another one who has =\r\nsaid exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a dif=\r\nferent view-point, differing with all the previous ones. And each of these =\r\ngiants have spoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations of =\r\ntruths. So personality and stature of the philosopher should play no role i=\r\nn an objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and st=\r\nature of a mathematician is of no use in&nbsp; judging the correctness of a=\r\n mathematical theory.&nbsp; Spiritually, the reality is same (and it maybe =\r\na very\n complex reality). But philosophically each have differences which c=\r\nannot the ignored. In such an intellectual climate, in my personal opinion,=\r\n it is fair enough to discard one philosophy for another, after a thorough =\r\nand detailed contemplation of the pros and cons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a spiritual vi=\r\new-point all this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spiritual giant one ch=\r\nooses to hang on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort is engaged, sur=\r\nely progress will happen in time. But philosophy is a another matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;[To make my stand clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some stra=\r\nnge miracle of God, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me, =\r\nI would have no qualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him and=\r\n asking for his blessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable. Yet=\r\n I will still not be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated during the t=\r\nime he lived.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Best\n Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-s=\r\npan&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D=\r\n&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_=\r\n2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, s=\r\nerif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_2_0_6=\r\n1_134997453972586&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamaj=\r\nAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, san=\r\ns-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new=\r\n york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Ari=\r\nal&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From=\r\n:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 11 October 2=\r\n012 10:32 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv179912576=\r\n4&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;=\r\ndiv id=3D&quot;yiv1799125764ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philoso=\r\nphy&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nactually &quot;rejecting&quot; may not be the right word you=\r\n probably mistakenly used.

The =\r\nphysical, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. =\r\nIn this subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own physical plane, th=\r\nere is a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like in our own worl=\r\nd. It is a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti. This force o=\r\nf pranashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive movements on the =\r\nconsciousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, d=\r\nisgust, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of influencing th=\r\ne thinking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tan=\r\ntrik sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using ones own prana-sh=\r\nakti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If=\r\n you think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever homa agni need=\r\ns a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka used the force o=\r\nf his/her\n own&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle formation=\r\n of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this sublte formatio=\r\nn of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its own. It =\r\ncan then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day lead hi=\r\nm/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond this=\r\n astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and=\r\n make it identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, it becomes =\r\nan even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human perspective, as =\r\nmuch a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the actual De=\r\nity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda in th=\r\ne Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When=\r\n a sadhaka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the =\r\ndeity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also is=\r\n trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the causal planes (the real spi=\r\nritual planes of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). T=\r\nhe difference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and t=\r\nhe real deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself of=\r\n causing a complete and total transformation of the average human nature wi=\r\nthout a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane of=\r\n the Great Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid bei=\r\nng transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformati=\r\non will it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine =\r\nhumility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingly=\r\n, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust,\n anger,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  je=\r\nalousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, mental-il=\r\nlumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such an in=\r\ndividual, even if he/she just sits down next to another person, will exude =\r\na silent strong peace and unselfish love which will automatically calm the =\r\nminds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authentic, =\r\nunhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the great deities. This comes=\r\n even if one deity is properly realized in the causal planes of existence. =\r\nBut the astral formation of the same deity, which is created by the force o=\r\nf our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not capable =\r\nof affecting this kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That is why =\r\nit is limited. It is not limited because it can&#39;t=C3=82&nbsp; get me a bett=\r\ner job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or bring me fame or any suc=\r\nh material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral formations of\n the deitie=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  can very easily do all these things in the physical world - but=\r\n it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the must authentic and =\r\npersistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one aim and destination o=\r\nf all genuine sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Since this astral plane is the wa=\r\ny it is, therefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep actively working on our=\r\nselves to increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surrender (whe=\r\nn that happens one accepts all life-situations without the slightest grudge=\r\n), humility, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is universally=\r\n accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are affected at=\r\n least to some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, one is simpl=\r\ny not ready to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from them spiritu=\r\nally. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a gap betwee=\r\nn experience and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lead to reali=\r\nzation. One off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it fritter=\r\ns away, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioning of the =\r\nsadhaka.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; th=\r\neory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; person reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think whatever thi=\r\ns guy is uttering is=C3=82&nbsp;complete truth, when in fact it is=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;far from truth. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Once=C3=82&nbsp;I saw in a article that Aurobi=\r\nndo said that Divine Lord who spoke &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Gita completely forgot it aft=\r\ner few minutes or so. I could not believe &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what I was reading. The=\r\nn my respect for this yogi went down the drain.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nYou surety is incorrect. There were certain events which happened in the la=\r\nst one and half years which made me sit down and rethink my own understandi=\r\nng of spirituality. At about the same time I started worshiping a specific =\r\npersonality of the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, the more=\r\n would thoughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is =\r\nimperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find =\r\nout what was wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking=\r\n. First question I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mi=\r\nnd could grasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and truths. B=\r\nut it was still not exceptionally clear.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I had first rea=\r\nd Sri Aurobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyond the first two =\r\npages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago some=\r\none gave me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and=\r\n rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arroga=\r\nnce. Never opened any of his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana w=\r\nas going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my un=\r\nderstanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thought in the form of=\r\n an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a=\r\n very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thorou=\r\nghly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in =\r\nthe prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I wa=\r\ns struggling to understand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet n=\r\not get a proper hang of, I was able to\n understand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  from his writi=\r\nngs with much deeper clarity.=C3=82&nbsp; Many of my own experiences made m=\r\nore sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a n=\r\new light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to=\r\n stop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 =\r\n% I will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational=\r\n mind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected fi=\r\nrmly 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing s=\r\nun. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The line that you mention, is from one of the earli=\r\ner writings of Sri Aurobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. I=\r\nn the Mahabharata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the gre=\r\nat war and when Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna ask=\r\ns Sri Krishna to repeat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war=\r\n (The Gita) once more since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, th=\r\ne time has passed away (it was a special time when the Gita was spoken), he=\r\n cannot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; once again. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sri Krishn=\r\na was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gur=\r\nus, for during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 days Swami V=\r\nivekananda would appear before him daily and instruct him on the various la=\r\nyers of the mind, which he was not aware of till then. Swami Vivekananda ha=\r\nd already left his physical body by then. It was in the writings of Sri Aur=\r\nobindo that he mentioned about the left and right hemisphere of the brain a=\r\nnd their difference in functionality, and their connection to spirituality,=\r\n about 30 years before medical science confirmed the same. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry, to pushing =\r\nhis own spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (which he descr=\r\nibes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuously by the =\r\nAdesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice of Krishna speakin=\r\ng to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, the =\r\nDivine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. Anyway, my poi=\r\nnt is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of spirituality. I ha=\r\nve benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefi=\r\nt. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, each with their uniqu=\r\ne perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individually try and f=\r\nind whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotional makeup, and help=\r\n us to progress on the path. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Though I now have a very d=\r\neep respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his cri=\r\ntics and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstoo=\r\nd the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a functio=\r\nn of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any gen=\r\nuine understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be unde=\r\nrstood accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ver=\r\ny different due to Darshan and=C3=82&nbsp;Grace of Divine Mother &amp; Divi=\r\nne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or follow t=\r\nhe &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; leader.Thanks.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I at-least will neve=\r\nr feel unhappy if you disagree. There are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; many saints, many philo=\r\nsophies, many paths, not everyone is bound to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; like every path.=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; Disagreement is perfectly ok. Because someone &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; disagrees=\r\n with me or those whom I agree with, does not mean I like him &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; any=\r\n less. I try to keep my=C3=82&nbsp; emotional side (where respect, love, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; dislike, hatred, anger, passions exist) separate from my thinking m=\r\nind. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is very much possible, through practice, for a man to dis=\r\nassociate &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his rational-mind from the emotional-mind. So have no f=\r\nears that your &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; disagreement is going to make me like you any less=\r\n or any more.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The problem with the emotional part of our=\r\n being is that it jumps up at appearances, running ahead to grasp the truth=\r\n rather than waiting patiently for the truth to arrive in all its aspects a=\r\nnd dimensions, and in the process it distorts the truth and then reacts to =\r\nthat distorted image. For example, recently in some social forums I posted =\r\na comment that I found the Tantrik Adwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi=\r\n Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-sel=\r\nling supporters. Immediately some friends of mine on Twitter and otherwise,=\r\n jumped to the false conclusion that I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and =\r\ntried best to make me &quot;see the truth&quot; by such grandiose statements that=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39; on Adwaitha and everything else must=\r\n be necessarily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denouncement. Both=\r\n of which are million light-years away from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankar=\r\na was a special Vibhuti&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  (manifestation) of God, that much I am ce=\r\nrtain. His compositions are so brilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficiently appr=\r\neciated in words. Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy=\r\n. And because I am not bound to accept his philosophy, does not mean I resp=\r\nect or love him any less than any other great saint.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; If you disrespect a man, and specially a saint, and then start dis=\r\nliking him too with a passion, you are creating strong negative karmas. But=\r\n if you can disagree with someone without losing respect or love for the pe=\r\nrson, in an objective manner, you reap very little karmic effects. That is =\r\nwhy Lord Krishna too advices us to become more detached in life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; In conclusion, Narasimha is totally correct. Many things cannot be=\r\n sufficiently expressed in words without causing some distortion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  From: Laxmi Narayan &=\r\nlt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;no=\r\nfollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subje=\r\nct: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi Bha=\r\ni,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; How are you doing?

Some of it can be genuine a=\r\nnd plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spiritual peop=\r\nle have never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand these things p=\r\nroperly, but some pattern is observable.=C3=82&nbsp; Not all experiences ar=\r\ne what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of e=\r\nxperiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genuine and whi=\r\nch is non-genuine. This is the world of astral&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  plane, driven by t=\r\nhe overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a h=\r\numan being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping infl=\r\nuence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; is possible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesse=\r\nr manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are =\r\nendless beings of varies character and hue who can very easily create an ex=\r\npereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake a=\r\nn experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a s=\r\neeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the =\r\nlower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a su=\r\nrface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious am=\r\nbitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc e=\r\ntc and at the other extreme this layer can, if\n properly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  channali=\r\nzed as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divin=\r\ne Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authent=\r\nic only to the extent that it helps to modify and transform your waking sur=\r\nface personality. That is the only true test.

It i=\r\ns the progressive unfolding of a transformation process.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Complex rituals and speedy sadhanas and experiences et al are ok=\r\n, provided one does not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  lose sight of the fundamentals. THEN thes=\r\ne can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in circles and going nowhere=\r\n. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritual entity. I had to learn =\r\nthis basic truth the hard-way.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/ht=\r\nml&gt;\r\n---2020808392-473503936-1349990793=:27561--\r\n\n"}}
