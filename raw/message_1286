The \n&gt; &gt; experience given by a=\r\n mantra and the internal/external results \n&gt; &gt; brought by a mantra vary fro=\r\nm mantra to mantra. But, even with a \n&gt; &gt; very powerful mantra, one needs t=\r\no be ready for the mantra to \n&gt; &gt; actually work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; a =\r\nmantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the \n&gt; mind \n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nonstantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect \n&gt; &gt; absorption=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes \ninternal \n&gt; &gt; chan=\r\nges by the flow of energy internally in specific ways \n&gt; (specific \n&gt; &gt; to =\r\nthe mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; u=\r\nniverse and corresponding karmic interactions between various \n&gt; &gt; objects.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There may be thousands of paths to climb a mount=\r\nain. Each path \n&gt; &gt; takes one to a different spot atop the mountain. The vi=\r\new one \nhas \n&gt; &gt; from the top may be different accordingly. One view may be=\r\n more \n&gt; &gt; breathtaking and amazing than another. However, one taking a \npa=\r\nth \n&gt; &gt; leading to a breathtaking view and one taking a path leading to \na =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; normal view both have to struggle on their paths and reach the \ntop \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; despite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, but none \nis \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n too easy. All paths are difficult to walk, but some result in a \n&gt; more \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; breathtaking view than the others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, o=\r\nne chanting a &quot;powerful mantra&quot; and a &quot;normal \n&gt; mantra&quot; \n&gt; &gt; will both hav=\r\ne to put in effort and overcome the weaknesses and \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; control over=\r\n mind. The power of the powerful mantra refers to a \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; powerful e=\r\nxperience after one succeeds with the mantra (more \n&gt; &gt; breathtaking scener=\r\ny on reaching the mountain top). It is not \n&gt; &gt; correct to think that thing=\r\ns will happen automatically and \neasily \n&gt; &gt; because one if chanting a powe=\r\nrful mantra 11 (or whatever) times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Coming back to Rajarshi&#39;s question, I =\r\ndo not recommend homam \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; Kunjika stotra. Kunjika stotra is a cod=\r\ned stotra containing \n&gt; several \n&gt; &gt; mantras in coded form. It is not what =\r\nit may seem to be. It is \nfor \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; reason that Shiva tells Parvati tha=\r\nt this prayer should be \nhidden \n&gt; &gt; like one&#39;s privates. It is weird that =\r\nwe are discussing such a \n&gt; &gt; secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a c=\r\nollection of \npowerful \n&gt; &gt; mantras for specific prayogas that would be con=\r\nsidered \n&gt; &gt; raajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to=\r\n \nthe \n&gt; &gt; actions is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I see no point in wanting to do homam with it. If you a=\r\nre \nmeant \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; do a homam with Kunjika stotra to stop the army of a c=\r\nountry in \n&gt; &gt; their tracks or kill someone or delude someone etc and if yo=\r\nu \nare \n&gt; &gt; detached enough to carry it off successfully, then you will be =\r\n\n&gt; given \n&gt; &gt; an opportunity by nature to learn it and do it. Otherwise, wh=\r\ny \n&gt; even \n&gt; &gt; try?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My advice is to drop the idea =\r\nof doing a homam with Kunjika \n&gt; &gt; stotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 ve=\r\nrses). If that is too \nlong \n&gt; &gt; for you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or jus=\r\nt the 4th chapter or \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; the 11th chapter. Another option is to do=\r\n a homam with just the \n&gt; &gt; moola mantra (navaakshari) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well,=C3=82=C2=A0a=\r\n \nhomam \n&gt; &gt; with Devi sooktam is a great idea too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A few mails from the la=\r\nst couple of weeks are pending reply.
