It is this Mantra, which when \nrecired regularly with devotio=\r\nn which opens up thedors of all \nspiritual and Vedic knowledge for the pers=\r\non.\n\nAs regards the disallowance of Veda learning to the ladies, there is \n=\r\nample proof available that this is a later development, maybe during \nthe p=\r\nresent post-Mughal era.\n\nApala, Ashwaghosha and so many others are the ladi=\r\nes held in high \nesteem due to their Vedic knowledge. Leelvati, daughter-in=\r\n-law of \ngreat Varahamihira is also a renowned name for her astrological \na=\r\nccumen, again in a vedanga. This however relates to Kaliyuga itself, \nthere=\r\nfore we can not ascribe the disallowance women of Veda-learning \nto the Kal=\r\niyuga.\n\nIn the Hindu (Sanatana) Culture, earlier Yajnopavita/Upanayan \nsams=\r\nkara (Sacred thread ceremony) was held for the women also, after \nwhich the=\r\ny were considered eligible for the Veda learning. Now-a-days \nthis sacred t=\r\nhread ceremony is held for the males only, and probably \nthis is somehow re=\r\nlated to the tradition.\n\nDuring this Yajnopavita samskara, one is also give=\r\nn a Guru-mantra, \nwhich is the key to all knowledge as it opens the doors o=\r\nf the \nlearning process for the Batuka, the person who is being given the \n=\r\nthread and Mantra.\n\nEven now, any traditional knowledge, be it astrology (a=\r\n vedanga), \nVedas, or even for the music learning from any classical GHARAN=\r\nAs, \nthe disciple is initiated through a ceremony, given mantra; or \na &quot;GAN=\r\nDA&quot; or talisman is tied by the guru on the arm of the Shishya \n(disciple) b=\r\nefore the teachings begin. This &quot;GANDA&quot; or talisman again \ncontains a mantr=\r\na written on some piece of paper or birch-bark (Bhoja-\npatra).\nSo it boils =\r\ndown to the &quot;Mantra&quot; that establishes a rapport between \nthe Guru and the S=\r\nhishya. Well, learning of Vedas is therefore not \nallowed without subscribi=\r\nng to a Guru, being a spiritual knowledge.\n\nThere are various criteria to d=\r\nebar one from learning Vedas, \nenumerated in Manu-smriti and other scriptur=\r\nes; and this \ninelligibility of women is a long-drawn extension from such c=\r\nriteria.\n\nregards,\n||Om Shri Krishnarpanamastu||\nHimanshu Mohan\n\n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinipurang&quot; \n&lt;rohinipurang@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\n warm namaste to everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have heard it said that women are not all=\r\nowed to read/know/recite \nthe \n&gt; vedas. Can anyone tell me if this is true?=\r\n If so, is there any \nmantra \n&gt; (or evidence)in any of the Vedas which says=\r\n this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask this not as a disrespectful argument but as a genuine des=\r\nire \nto \n&gt; know what the text actually says, if it does indeed say anything=\r\n at \nall \n&gt; on the subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also I have heard that a Brahmin who does =\r\nhave the right to \nrecite/use \n&gt; the mantras has to follow a certain (very =\r\nstrict) way of life. Is \nthis \n&gt; too mentioned in any of these &#39;books&#39; (for=\r\n want of a better word)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Rohini\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
