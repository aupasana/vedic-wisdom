Infact I am also pass=\r\ning through the similar phase. \n\nIn last some time, i have realised that be=\r\nst think is &#39;not trying to unlearn&#39;\n\nI try to follow two steps. 1st is surr=\r\nendering to god.  I try surrender whole of my efforts to Guru. whether i me=\r\nditate or not. whether i am able to concentrate or not whether i feel somet=\r\nhing or not all is guru&#39;s wish. \n\nSecond is to concentrate on mantra (or pi=\r\ncture or any other point) alone.  any other thought or idea  or experience =\r\nis welcome and is honoured and is kept aside respectfully.  and i try to at=\r\ntend the mantra again. although i am not perfect in this and i dont know wh=\r\nether it is correct method or not. But who cares when guru is therr. even i=\r\nf i do something wrong he will take care of it.\n\nSorry for mistakes\n\nRegard=\r\ns\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;srinivas&quot; &lt;sow4reap@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am in question whether &quot;am i doing the right way of medit=\r\nation&quot;, sometimes even `am meditating aren&#39;t ?&quot;. Seems very tough for me to=\r\n unlearn the mind while meditating.Respected members please suggest any tip=\r\ns for efficacious way of mediation. Also wanted to understand how oneself w=\r\nill learn that he/she is into good meditative state. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Sri=\r\nni.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
