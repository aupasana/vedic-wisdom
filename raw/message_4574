The Maginot Line had cracked and\ncr=\r\numbled, and Paris had fallen to the mighty army of the invader.\n\nI had expe=\r\ncted to see some marks of this widespread devastation on the life\nof Ramana=\r\nshram, but on arrival I found none whatever, except, to my\nsurprise, a doub=\r\nled rate of flow of devotees.\n\nThe only other physical change I observed wa=\r\ns in the Master=E2=80=99s body, which\nstarted showing signs of age, which h=\r\nad compelled the management to curtail\nthe attendance hours at night. At mi=\r\ndday the doors of the hall were closed\nfor two hours for his siesta =E2=80=\r\n=93 the first time in the history of the Ashram.\nAt first Bhagavan demurred=\r\n but soon he grew resigned to the situation,\nseeing that it had some justif=\r\nication.\n\nThe stream of visitors continued to increase, so that soon afterw=\r\nards\nsitting accommodation and easy access to the Master on personal matter=\r\ns\nbecame difficult.\n\n\nIn fact under the new rules, letters and articles wri=\r\ntten by devotees were\nmade first to pass the censorship of the office befor=\r\ne they could be shown\nto him, which was not without reasons. One or two dev=\r\notees, taking advantage\nof the Master=E2=80=99s compassionate nature, took =\r\nto write to him letters running\nto several pages in very small hand on pett=\r\ny, often imaginary,difficulties\nin their spiritual practice, on which he st=\r\nrained his eyes for one or two\nhours.
