That fire=\r\n can carry various \nauspicious substances to various deities, but does NOT =\r\nlike to carry stuff \nlike alcohol and meat, even if a deity is willing to r=\r\neceive the offering. \nIf you want to offer alcohol to a deity such as Bhair=\r\nava, call the deity in \nan idol or a kalasha (pot) or in an animal and then=\r\n make the offering of \nalcohol. But do not use homam fire to make the offer=\r\ning.\n\nAnother type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha (c=\r\narrier \nof impurities) can be used to carry anything, without restrictions.=\r\n However, \nthis fire is not used in homam.\n\nA few deities such as Smashaana=\r\n Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali may be worshipped \non a funeral pyre with any m=\r\naterials. However, such rituals are not \nappropriate for 99.99999999% peopl=\r\ne. Those are only for people who already \nhave a very high level of detachm=\r\nent and a very low level of distinction \nbetween the polarities of duality,=\r\n i.e. people who have a very low level of \nmental distinction between thing=\r\ns normally considered highly pure and things \nnormally considered highly im=\r\npure and see all as One. As a result of their \nworship on funeral pyre, the=\r\ny may get results that are normally considered \ngood or results that are no=\r\nrmally considered terrible, but again their \nmental distinction between goo=\r\nd and bad results is very low and they accept \nall results with an equal vi=\r\nsion. Rituals practiced by such aghoris are \naimed at honing their detachme=\r\nnt and non-distinction to further perfection.\n\nSuch aghora practices are no=\r\nt to be done out of &quot;fascination&quot; or because \nthey seem or sound &quot;cool&quot;. Th=\r\nat is a formula for failure and disaster. For \nthe majority of us who are s=\r\ntill deeply affected by the polarities of \nduality and cannot see all thing=\r\ns equally, worship of any deity in funeral \npyre is a strict no-no. Stick t=\r\no regular homam and maintain basic purity, no \nmatter which deity you worsh=\r\nip in the fire. In that case, throwing chillies, \nmeat and alcohol in fire =\r\nis a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some people do \nnot realize it and throw =\r\nthese things in their homam fire. This is a \nterrible thing to do.\n\nPeople =\r\nin this age foolishly mix up principles of duality and non-duality. \nPrinci=\r\nples of non-duality like &quot;all is god&quot; are applicable only if you can \nsee g=\r\nod in pleasure and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and \npain=\r\n are two distinct feelings for you and you prefer one to the other, then \ny=\r\nou are immersed in duality and follow the principles of duality without \nmi=\r\nxing up non-dual principles and pretending &quot;all is god&quot;. All is NOT god \nfo=\r\nr you then.\n\nOffering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can bring terrib=\r\nle results to \none. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience =\r\nthe results \nimmediately, but most people do not experience right away. As =\r\na result, they \ndo not realize what a terrible thing they are doing. My hum=\r\nble request to \neverybody who performs homam is to stay away from using suc=\r\nh taamasik \nmaterials.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFr=\r\nee Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannat=\r\nh Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 17, 2008 2:38 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa=\r\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; I was seeing a homa being done by a person where a=\r\nlcohol was being\n&gt; offered in the fire.
