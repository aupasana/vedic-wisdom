I believe it is very important for all\n&gt; of us to not go through similar experiance. Are there any precautions,\n&gt; one can take? Any special mantras to protect one self?\n\nIf one is ready, the best is to not think of the energy as &quot;mine&quot;. Who is \nrobbing, what is he robbing, and from whom is he robbing? All is god&#39;s \nanyway. What is not really yours, despite being perceived by you to be \nyours, may be taken away from you. But what is really yours cannot be taken \naway.\n\nHowever, one may not be ready to think that way, perhaps because one still \nhas many karmik debts to pay back and need to *hold on* to things that help \none with that. In that case, some prcautions may be taken. I recommend Devi \nKavacham (also known as Chandi Kavacham). Chanting it once or several times \nevery morning for a duration will form a subtle shield around one that will \nprotect one from this kind of people.\n\nNarayana kavacham is another powerful shield mantra. Depending on one&#39;s \ntaste, one may try Narayana kavacham or Devi kavacham.\n\nBut the key is to do it regularly.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, February 15, 2009 12:45 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Interesting experiance\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Friends\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently I attended a spiritual workshop that ran over say 10 hours.\n&gt; But the next day I felt like I was completely drained of my energies,\n&gt; I felt very tired and also felt that I lost lot of good energies,\n&gt; in fact the person conducting the workshop did also indicate that one\n&gt; can experiance similar things when one goes to a group meeting and one\n&gt; needs to be careful about it. I did not pay much attention then but\n&gt; really I felt bad the next few days to the point that I regret going\n&gt; there.
