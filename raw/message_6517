During discussions Goddess Parvathi , asks shiva, w=\r\nhy Rama cries like an ordinary mortal when Sita is lost? If he is an ordina=\r\nry man , why should we pray to him at all. Then Shiva narrates to her the i=\r\nnnermost thoughts of Lord Rama which he told his friend devotee Lord Hanuma=\r\nn. The devanagari text is available in http://adhyatmaramayan.googlepages.c=\r\nom/sriramahridayam)\n\n* * *\n\nLord Shiva said:- \n\nThen Rama himself addressin=\r\ng Hanuman who was near him told, \nHear about the truth about Athma, Anathma=\r\n and Paramthma. \n\nThe great ones see the sky in three different ways, \nThe =\r\ngreat sky as reflected in great body of water, \nThen as the limit that sepa=\r\nrates and also as shadow. \n\nThe first is the hidden power of the brain, \nTh=\r\nen that power which is complete, \nAnd then the splendour idolized within us=\r\n, \nAre the three types of Athma told by me. \n\n\nWhatever the hidden brain do=\r\nes, Due to ignorance is ascribed to illusion , To the Paramathma* which is =\r\n, Without feelings and is only a witness, Similarly some fools ascribe, The=\r\n activities of Jeevathma** to it. \n*That soul which is everywhere and never=\r\n dies \n** The body of the being which vanishes with death \n\nShadow is not r=\r\neal but ignorance , And the feeling that it is true, Which appears to us is=\r\n due to ignorance, Like the Brahmam is the undivided truth, And the thought=\r\n of it being divided is ignorance. \n\nWords like &quot;You are it&quot;, seeks to brin=\r\ng unity between, \nThe undivided entirety and shadowy concept of division. \n=\r\n\n\nDue to the great saying when knowledge of unity of thought*, \nArises , wi=\r\nth it is destroyed thought of self as well as pride, \n*That Jeevathma and P=\r\naramathma are one. \n\nWhen my devotee understands this great truth,  He beco=\r\nmes one with me but for those who do not have devotion,  And have fallen in=\r\n the deep pits of science,  Even in one hundred births will not get salvati=\r\non. \n\nThis secret of the heart of my soul, Which has been told to you, Oh H=\r\nanuman, Would give kingship better than that of Indra, And should not be to=\r\nld to those who are, Adamant and refuse too be my devotees.\n\n\nregards\npriya=\r\nnk\n\n\n"}}
