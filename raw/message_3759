It is not only a great s=\r\npiritual text in the form of occult lessons, occult teachings of which I ha=\r\nve given you an outline. But, it is also a great Mantra-Sastra. Every sloka=\r\n, every verse of the Devi-Mahatmya is a Mantra by itself. I will tell you h=\r\now it is a Mantra, by giving only one instance, that is the first sloka its=\r\nelf. &#39;Savarnih suryatanayo yo manuh Kathyate-shtamah. This is the first slo=\r\nka, Savarnih Surya-Tanayah. It is all a Tantric interpretation and a very d=\r\nifficult thing to understand. But I am giving you only an idea as to what i=\r\nt is all like. Surya represents fire, the fire-principle. &#39;Surya-Tanaya&#39; me=\r\nans that which is born of the fire-principle. What is it that is born of th=\r\ne fire-principle? It is the seed &#39;Ra&#39;. According to Tantric esoteric psycho=\r\nlogy, &#39;Ram&#39; is the Bija Mantra of Agni. In the word Savarnih, &#39;varni&#39; means=\r\n a hook; so add one hook to &#39;Ram&#39;. Yo Manuh Kathyate,\n ashtamah. Eighth let=\r\nter--What is Manu? It is a letter in Sanskrit. Eight letters are Ya, Ra, La=\r\n, Va, Sya, Sha, Sa, Ha. The eighth is Ha. Add Ha to it. Ha, Ra and one hook=\r\n, make &#39;Hreem&#39;. Savarnih Suryo-Tanayo Yo Manuh Kathyateshtamah, Nisamaya Ta=\r\ndutpattim,--you hear the glory of that, the sage says. So, the first verse =\r\nmeans: &quot;Now, I shall describe to you the glory of &#39;Hreem&#39;.&quot; This Hreem is t=\r\nhe Bija of Devi. But, outwardly it means, &quot;Listen to the story of the king =\r\nso and so, who is the eighth Manu&quot; and all that. Thus in addition to the ou=\r\nter meaning, there is an inner significance of the Mantra. I am giving you =\r\nonly the case of one Mantra. Like this, every Mantra is full of inner signi=\r\nficance. And every Mantra is repeated by devotees for some purpose or the o=\r\nther. Especially, the Devi-Mahatmya is recited for averting calamities in l=\r\nife. Catastrophies, calamities and tensions, personal or outward, whatever =\r\nthey be, all these are averted by a regular\n daily recital of the Devi-Maha=\r\ntmya. When there is war threatening a country, for example, or pestilence o=\r\nr epidemic spreading everywhere, or any internal tension or anxiety of any =\r\nkind, the Devi-Mahatmya is to be studied and it is a very potent remedy pre=\r\nscribed by seers of yore, not only for temporal terrestrial prosperity, but=\r\n also for the glory of the hereafter, for illumination, for the destruction=\r\n of Avidya or Ajnana, for overcoming Mala, Vikshepa and Avarana, and to be =\r\na fit recipient of the grace of the Almighty. Thus is the outer significanc=\r\ne and the inner significance of the Devi-Mahatmya and the special meaning t=\r\nhat it has in the life of spiritual seekers or Sadhakas. Glory to God! Glor=\r\ny to Sadhana! Glory to the integral character of spiritual practice! May we=\r\n be blessed with this illumination, with this wisdom, with the strength to =\r\ntread the path of the Spirit, to our ultimate Freedom! &quot;\n\n--- On Sun, 2/21/=\r\n10, alokbhat &lt;alokbhat@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: alokbhat &lt;alokbhat@yahoo.c=\r\nom&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\nTo: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, February 21, 2010, 10:35 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nNam=\r\naste Nagraj,\n\nAll the best on your spiritual endevaours as you embark on le=\r\narning the Saptashati and eventually performing homam with it. One thing th=\r\nat I thought might be of great use in your journey is a powerful narrative =\r\nfrom Narasimha on the deeper meaning of the Chandi Saptashati in his inaugu=\r\nral post to this group. I reproduce it here so that it may help you and the=\r\n legions of devotees who are performing\nor getting ready to perform Chandi =\r\nHomam.\n\nOn the surface it seems like a simple story of Mother Goddesses&#39; va=\r\nlour and battlefield exploits over fierce and seemingly unvanquishable demo=\r\nns. When I first read the Chandi (and I&#39;m not ready yet to perform the homa=\r\nm) I was stricken by self-doubt by what seemed a simplistic narrative - dem=\r\nons arise and Mother kills them, some more demons arise and Mother conquers=\r\n them and so on it went...but Narasimhaji&#39; s powerful synthesis of the deep=\r\ner meaning and some other material that I read on Shreema&#39;s website dispell=\r\ned all doubts as to what this extremely potent and powerful text is all abo=\r\nut. I faithfully reproduce it below (later on I will reproduce some of the =\r\ncomments of Satyananda Saraswati from Shreema&#39;s ashram on the great Saptash=\r\nati).\n\nHerewith:\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - =\r\n- - - - -\n\nSome people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati is merely an=\r\n account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mahisha, Chand=\r\na, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a collection =\r\nof stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmyam is much =\r\nmore than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swaroopam! Rigv=\r\neda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/ a different m=\r\nanifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpose of Vedas=\r\n is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopam be about =\r\nsomething other than self-knowledge? \n\n* * *\n\nThough Devi Mahatmyam looks l=\r\nike stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her nature in it. The deepe=\r\nr you go, the more you can understand and appreciate the lessons in the sto=\r\nries. Let me give a couple of examples.\n\n(1) When various Mothers are going=\r\n to war with demons, this is how it is described (8-14): &quot;Whatever form, de=\r\ncoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, his shakti (energy) came in the=\r\n same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle.&quot; The next 9 verses describe ho=\r\nw Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani came on a swan with aksha sutr=\r\na and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari came on a great bull with a Tr=\r\nishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. And so on.\n\nWhat is the message =\r\nhidden in the above description? The normal imagery painted elsewhere is of=\r\n female deities with a separate form. Here, they are depicted differently.\n=\r\n\nThe fact that these female deities are identical to the male counterparts =\r\nin form, decoration, weapons and vehicles suggests, to me, that they are no=\r\nt really separate from the male counterparts. Brahma and Brahmaani are not =\r\nseparate. Maheswara and Maaheswari are not separate. Vishnu and Vaishnavi a=\r\nre not separate. And so on. Brahmaani is simply the shakti (vitality/energy=\r\n) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simply the shakti (vitality/energy) of Maheswara=\r\n. And so on.\n\nIf Vaishnavi went on Garuda vehicle and killed a demon, it ac=\r\ntually means that Vishnu went on a Garuda vehicle and killed the demon. Vai=\r\nshanvi is the personification of Vishnu&#39;s energy, which makes Vishnu be, th=\r\nink, desire, move and act. Vaishnavi is not separate from Vishnu.\n\nOf cours=\r\ne, if you imagine Vaishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate person with certain att=\r\nributes, She may manifest limited by your imagination and even give you a d=\r\narshan in that form. However, that is a limited form and Her true nature is=\r\n beyond that. Her true and highest nature is that She is an inseparable par=\r\nt of Vishnu and represents the energy of Vishnu. She is the part of Vishnu =\r\nthat makes Vishnu think, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi is basically Chetana (a=\r\nnimated consciousness) of Vishnu.\n\nThus, contemplation on these verses will=\r\n make you understand the true nature of male devatas and female devatas and=\r\n their relationship better. It will enable you to appreciate the highest na=\r\nture of Shakti.\n\nPuranas personify everything to make things interesting an=\r\nd understandable by laymen. However, it is more fun to explore the deeper m=\r\neanings.\n\n(2) Take Raktabeeja&#39;s slaying. Raktabeeja is a demon with a speci=\r\nal ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body on the ground, another d=\r\nemon will be born from it and will be of the same size, age and strength as=\r\n the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishnavi, Maaheswari, Aindri et=\r\nc were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and more demons were being bor=\r\nn and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa told Kaali to expand her fac=\r\ne and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandika goes around the war gro=\r\nund eating all the demons as they are born and eventually Raktabeeja runs o=\r\nut of blood.\n\nThis looks like a nice story. But, is there is a deeper meani=\r\nng in it that helps you in self-realization? Why was Kaali the chosen one a=\r\nnd not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?\n\nThe word rakta means blood. Anot=\r\nher meaning is &quot;desire/passion&quot; . The word comes from the root ranj/rang, w=\r\nhich means &quot;to color&quot;. Desire/passion/ attachment colors and conditions the=\r\n mind. Beeja means seed.\n\nRaktabeeja means &quot;the seed of desire&quot;. Raktabeeja=\r\n fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the better of our good judgme=\r\nnt and good qualities. Each human being is a microcosm of the macrocosm tha=\r\nt the universe is. All devatas reside in us as various good qualities and a=\r\nll demons reside in us as various undesirable qualities. When we are overco=\r\nme by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja within us is defeating the g=\r\nods within us.\n\nThe thing is that desires are difficult to get rid of. You =\r\nget rid of one desire and another desire is born. That is what Raktabeeja&#39;s=\r\n special ability means. The &quot;seed of desires&quot; (i.e. basic attachment that i=\r\ns the nature of mind) within us will keep producing more and more desires. =\r\nIt is very resourceful.\n\nThen, why Kaali to destroy Him?\n\nIn astrology, we =\r\nassociate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali with Saturn. Kaali shows detachment and=\r\n vairaagyam. She wears a garland of skulls, symbolizing that there is an en=\r\ndless cycle (garland) of births a material form (skull) goes thru. The way =\r\nKaali shows to overcome the cycle is vairaagyam and detachment. She shows m=\r\neaningful and highest level of vairaagyam that comes with a deep understand=\r\ning of the cycle of material forms.\n\nTo fully cut off the &quot;seed of desires&quot;=\r\n so that one does not get any more desires, one needs to develop vairaagyam=\r\n and detachment and keep on destroying desires as they are born and persist=\r\n like that. After persisting for a long time, the &quot;seed of desires&quot; will ru=\r\nn out of desires and the basic attachment of mind will vanish.\n\nThus, simpl=\r\ne stories have deep meanings. This particular story celebrates the value of=\r\n detachment, vairaagyam and persistence - Saturnine qualities.\n\n* * *\n\nMere=\r\nly chanting Chandi saptashati without understanding the meaning is also exc=\r\nellent and produces results. Understanding the meaning and marvelling at th=\r\ne power of the Mother makes one fearless and energetic and also give materi=\r\nal benefits. Understanding the deeper meanings and appreciating the True Na=\r\nture of the Mother makes one realize one&#39;s own true nature. It has various =\r\nbenefits at various levels of sadhana. It is tough to exactly say what bene=\r\nfit it gives, as that depends on the evolution level of sadhaka and his att=\r\nitude. But, there is something in Chandipath for everyone!\n\nHowever, the hi=\r\nghest purpose is self-knowledge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam.\n\n*=\r\n * *\n\nTowards the end, the 11th chapter (titled &quot;Naaraayani Stuti&quot;) describ=\r\nes gods praying to the Divine Mother after slaying all the demons. They add=\r\nress Her as &quot;Naaraayani&quot; . Trimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of the t=\r\nhree gunas. Vishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains the cr=\r\neation. However, Narayana is different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Narayana=\r\n sooktam with Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attributes) .=\r\n He is the Sahasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). Some p=\r\neople may validly describe the same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let us no=\r\nt argue about names. When we are essentially speaking about an entity that =\r\nis beyond attributes, it is foolish to argue about the name. After all, nam=\r\ne too is an attribute that intends to describe other attributes! Though gre=\r\nat people gave different names to Parama Purusha, the names essentially cap=\r\nture the nature of the *path* those people took to experience the Parama\n P=\r\nurusha rather than the nature of Parama Purusha, which is beyond names and =\r\nattributes.\n\nThe bottomline is that there is a Parama Purusha above the Tri=\r\nmurthis (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). IF we call him Narayana, then Narayani =\r\nis His energy and She is the root cause of all manifested creation.\n\nSaptas=\r\nhati is about Narayani. It is about the inseparable root energy of the Supr=\r\neme Cosmic Being who is the source of this entire universe. A small part of=\r\n that root energy lies within us too. Because I said &quot;small part&quot;, don&#39;t th=\r\nink it is small. Even a small percentage of infinity is still infinity. Tho=\r\nugh each of us is a microcosm of the macrocosm that the entire universe is,=\r\n each of us is a complete and accurate replica of the entire universe. Thin=\r\nk &quot;poornamadah poornamidam&quot; in Vedic spirit! The purpose of all spiritual s=\r\nadhana is realizing the true nature of self. Chandipath can also be viewed =\r\nfrom that perspective.\n\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -----\n\n\nSomeone queried a while back on the meaning behind the story of M=\r\nadhu Kaitabha. Here is a quick reply based on my limited understanding.\n\n* =\r\n* *\n\nMadhu means honey. &quot;Madhu keeta&quot; means an insect of honey, i.e. honey =\r\nbee. Madhu kaita means belonging to honey bees. It can be the qualities or =\r\nnature of honey bees. One of the meanings of &quot;bha&quot; is &quot;having a similarity =\r\nto&quot;. Thus, in my judgment, &quot;Madhu Kaitabha&quot; means &quot;having a semblance to th=\r\ne nature of honey bees&quot;.\n\n* * *\n\nLike I keep saying, Sanskrit is a fantasti=\r\nc language. Sanskrit names selected by Rishis for expressing various concep=\r\nts and stories are very thoughtful. Depending on how deep one goes, there a=\r\nre many meanings of the same word. Thus, Rishis expressed concepts that may=\r\n have one meaning to a layman and a different meaning to one who is ready t=\r\no understand the deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of our Rishis!\n\nI w=\r\nas saying the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last weekend. When somebo=\r\ndy said at an open discussion that the idea is important and not the name, =\r\nas there are many names of the same thing in many languages, I made a quick=\r\n point about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that Sanskrit names have n=\r\not one meaning, but layers of meanings that can be understood based on the =\r\ncapability of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some special meanings an=\r\nd to keep some higher knowledge as secret, even though it is very much out =\r\nthere! The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara described bhavas =\r\n(houses) and how to find their respective padas (arudha padas of houses) an=\r\nd said that a bhava and its pada should be judged to see the matters of a h=\r\nouse. Though he did not explain the difference between a bhava and its pada=\r\n further and did not elucidate when to use which one, I said that the very =\r\nchoice of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually\n translated as a ho=\r\nuse, also means &quot;a thought/concept/ feeling&quot; and pada means &quot;a symbol/word&quot;=\r\n used to express a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to their arudha padas =\r\nwhat thoughts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attempt to express the=\r\nm. For example, if the 4th house shows one&#39;s happiness from vehicles, the p=\r\nada of 4th house shows the tangible articles that attempt to throw light on=\r\n one&#39;s happiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle owned by one). Ho=\r\nuses (bhavas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter (just like thoug=\r\nhts inside one&#39;s head), while their arudha padas show tangible/external asp=\r\nects of a matter (just like the external words spoken that attempt to expre=\r\nss the thoughts in the head). If you use the English words to translate Par=\r\nasara, this hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that Sanskrit names us=\r\ned by Rishis are not like words in any language.\n\n* * *\n\nAnyway, let us com=\r\ne back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I said, Madhu Kaitabha means &quot;having=\r\n a semblance to the quality of honeybees&quot;. What is the quality of honey bee=\r\ns? Well, they keep working hard to accumulate the sweet honey! They are not=\r\n intelligent enough to think about any higher things in life. Thus, Madhu K=\r\naitabha are an allegory to the quality within us which makes us work hard, =\r\nlike honeybees, with a single-minded focus on accumulating material comfort=\r\ns. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accumulate material objects and spen=\r\nd whole life working hard doing just that.\n\nVishnu is a personification of =\r\nthe sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being). Within us=\r\n, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna within us. Madhu Kaitabha were b=\r\norn from Vishnu&#39;s earwax when He was alseep. The ability to work hard like =\r\na bee is not really a terrible thing. This ability is essentially born from=\r\n the sattwa guna within us, when it is in deep slumber (i.e. sattwa guna co=\r\nvered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna that &quot;manifests&quot; in a taamasik wa=\r\ny).\n\nThere are so many good people in this world, who just spend their enti=\r\nre lives in honest labor like the honeybees and accumulate things for thems=\r\nelves and others around them. Their sattwa is in deep sleep and Madhu Kaita=\r\nbha born from that asleep sattva are very much active.\n\nThe problem with th=\r\nis focus on hard work and accumulation of material objects is that it keeps=\r\n us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaitabha&#39;s attack on Brahma and Vedas is=\r\n symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the supreme and liberating knowledge of =\r\nself and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, symbolizes the sadhana to achieve th=\r\ne supreme knowledge. The focus on working like honeybees and accumulating m=\r\naterial objects tries to kills one&#39;s ability to do sadhana and obtain supre=\r\nme knowledge of self.\n\nVishnu battles Madhu Kaitabha for 5,000 years. Devi =\r\nBhagavatam even describes that Vishnu wondered in the middle how to defeat =\r\nMadhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite formidable! Even when the sattva in =\r\nus awakens, it is difficult for it to overcome the formidable instinct to l=\r\nead the life of a honeybee and to accumulate the material objects for onese=\r\nlf and others.\n\nAccording to Parasara, thighs are seen from the 9th house o=\r\nf dharma. The earthy element symbolizes the commitment and stability. The f=\r\nact that earthy element came from the thighs of Vishnu shows that it is the=\r\n dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this universe that ensures that there is =\r\ncommitment and stability in this creation.\n\nMoreover, it is apt that someon=\r\ne born in the ears (3rd house) of Vishnu found end in the thighs (9th house=\r\n, i.e. 7th house of death from the 3rd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, Brahma,=\r\n who is born from the navel (6th house) of Vishnu should naturally find His=\r\n end in the 12th house of Vishnu (feet/sleep) , which is the 7th house of d=\r\neath from the 6th house! That may be why Vishnu goes to sleep, when there i=\r\ns a change of Brahma.\n\nAnyway, the instinct within us to keep accumulating =\r\nmaterial objects like honey bees accumulate honey finds its end in the dhar=\r\nma of the sattwa guna, i.e. when the sattwa guna within us follows its dhar=\r\nma. Then we are fully awake spiritually. Naturally, the path to self-knowle=\r\ndge becomes open then and Brahma becomes elated.\n\nThus, the story of Madhu-=\r\nKaitabha refers, allegorically, to the instinct most of us have towards lea=\r\nding a &quot;regular&quot; life, working hard like honeybees and accumulating objects=\r\n for self and others and how that instinct needs to be defeated by waking u=\r\np the sattwa guna and allowing it to perform its dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nLest I am =\r\nmisunderstood, I need to clarify one thing. I am not saying that these stor=\r\nies are not real. These stories ARE very much real. In fact, when a Yogi is=\r\n able to transport consciousness (Kundalini) to a particular plane (chakra)=\r\n, He/She can vividly see these stories actually happening.

It is not only a great spiritual text in the form of occult lessons, =\r\noccult teachings of which I have given you an outline. But, it is also a gr=\r\neat &lt;I&gt;Mantra-Sastra&lt;/I&gt;. Every &lt;I&gt;sloka&lt;/I&gt;, every verse of the Devi-Mahat=\r\nmya is a Mantra by itself. I will tell you how it is a Mantra, by giving on=\r\nly one instance, that is the first sloka itself. &lt;I&gt;&#39;Savarnih suryatanayo y=\r\no manuh Kathyate-shtamah&lt;/I&gt;. This is the first sloka, &lt;I&gt;Savarnih Surya-Ta=\r\nnayah&lt;/I&gt;. It is all a Tantric interpretation and a very difficult thing to=\r\n understand. But I am giving you only an idea as to what it is all like. &lt;I=\r\n&gt;Surya&lt;/I&gt; represents fire, the fire-principle. &lt;I&gt;&#39;Surya-Tanaya&#39;&lt;/I&gt; means=\r\n that which is born of the fire-principle. What is it that is born of the f=\r\nire-principle? It is the seed &lt;I&gt;&#39;Ra&#39;&lt;/I&gt;. According to Tantric esoteric ps=\r\nychology, &lt;I&gt;&#39;Ram&#39;&lt;/I&gt; is the Bija Mantra of Agni. In the word &lt;I&gt;Savarnih,=\r\n &#39;varni&#39;&lt;/I&gt;\n means a hook; so add one hook to &lt;I&gt;&#39;Ram&#39;. Yo Manuh Kathyate,=\r\n ashtamah&lt;/I&gt;. Eighth letter--What is &lt;I&gt;Manu&lt;/I&gt;? It is a letter in Sanskr=\r\nit. Eight letters are &lt;I&gt;Ya, Ra, La, Va, Sya, Sha, Sa, Ha&lt;/I&gt;. The eighth i=\r\ns &lt;I&gt;Ha&lt;/I&gt;. Add Ha to it. &lt;I&gt;Ha, Ra&lt;/I&gt; and one hook, make &lt;I&gt;&#39;Hreem&#39;&lt;/I&gt;.=\r\n &lt;I&gt;Savarnih Suryo-Tanayo Yo Manuh Kathyateshtamah, Nisamaya Tadutpattim&lt;/I=\r\n&gt;,--you hear the glory of that, the sage says. So, the first verse means: &quot;=\r\nNow, I shall describe to you the glory of &lt;I&gt;&#39;Hreem&#39;&lt;/I&gt;.&quot; This &lt;I&gt;Hreem&lt;/I=\r\n&gt; is the Bija of Devi. But, outwardly it means, &quot;Listen to the story of the=\r\n king so and so, who is the eighth Manu&quot; and all that. Thus in addition to =\r\nthe outer meaning, there is an inner significance of the Mantra. I am givin=\r\ng you only the case of one Mantra. Like this, every Mantra is full of inner=\r\n significance. And every Mantra is repeated by devotees for some purpose or=\r\n the other. Especially, the Devi-Mahatmya is recited for averting calamitie=\r\ns in\n life. Catastrophies, calamities and tensions, personal or outward, wh=\r\natever they be, all these are averted by a regular daily recital of the Dev=\r\ni-Mahatmya. When there is war threatening a country, for example, or pestil=\r\nence or epidemic spreading everywhere, or any internal tension or anxiety o=\r\nf any kind, the Devi-Mahatmya is to be studied and it is a very potent reme=\r\ndy prescribed by seers of yore, not only for temporal terrestrial prosperit=\r\ny, but also for the glory of the hereafter, for illumination, for the destr=\r\nuction of &lt;I&gt;Avidya&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;Ajnana&lt;/I&gt;, for overcoming &lt;I&gt;Mala, Vikshepa&lt;=\r\n/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Avarana&lt;/I&gt;, and to be a fit recipient of the grace of the Almig=\r\nhty. Thus is the outer significance and the inner significance of the Devi-=\r\nMahatmya and the special meaning that it has in the life of spiritual seeke=\r\nrs or Sadhakas. Glory to God! Glory to Sadhana! Glory to the integral chara=\r\ncter of spiritual practice! May we be blessed with this illumination,\n with=\r\n this wisdom, with the strength to tread the path of the Spirit, to our ult=\r\nimate Freedom! &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 2/21/10, alokbhat &lt;I&gt;&lt=\r\n;alokbhat@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEF=\r\nT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: =\r\nalokbhat &lt;alokbhat@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi H=\r\nomam and Sri Vidya&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Sunday, Feb=\r\nruary 21, 2010, 10:35 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv854250704&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISP=\r\nLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Nagraj,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nAll the best on your spiritual endevaours as you embark on learning the Sap=\r\ntashati and eventually performing homam with it. One thing that I thought m=\r\night be of great use in your journey is a powerful narrative from Narasimha=\r\n on the deeper meaning of the Chandi Saptashati in his inaugural post to th=\r\nis group. I reproduce it here so that it may help you and the legions of de=\r\nvotees who are performing&lt;BR&gt;or getting ready to perform Chandi Homam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;On the surface it seems like a simple story of Mother Goddesses&#39; valour =\r\nand battlefield exploits over fierce and seemingly unvanquishable demons. W=\r\nhen I first read the Chandi (and I&#39;m not ready yet to perform the homam) I =\r\nwas stricken by self-doubt by what seemed a simplistic narrative - demons a=\r\nrise and Mother kills them, some more demons arise and Mother conquers them=\r\n and so on it went...but Narasimhaji&#39; s powerful synthesis of the deeper me=\r\naning and some other material that I\n read on Shreema&#39;s website dispelled a=\r\nll doubts as to what this extremely potent and powerful text is all about. =\r\nI faithfully reproduce it below (later on I will reproduce some of the comm=\r\nents of Satyananda Saraswati from Shreema&#39;s ashram on the great Saptashati)=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Herewith:&lt;BR&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -=\r\n - - - - - - -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati i=\r\ns merely an account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mah=\r\nisha, Chanda, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a =\r\ncollection of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmy=\r\nam is much more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swar=\r\noopam! Rigveda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/ a =\r\ndifferent manifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpo=\r\nse of Vedas is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopa=\r\nm be about something other\n than self-knowledge? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thoug=\r\nh Devi Mahatmyam looks like stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her=\r\n nature in it. The deeper you go, the more you can understand and appreciat=\r\ne the lessons in the stories. Let me give a couple of examples.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) =\r\nWhen various Mothers are going to war with demons, this is how it is descri=\r\nbed (8-14): &quot;Whatever form, decoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, h=\r\nis shakti (energy) came in the same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle.&quot;=\r\n The next 9 verses describe how Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani =\r\ncame on a swan with aksha sutra and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari =\r\ncame on a great bull with a Trishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. An=\r\nd so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What is the message hidden in the above description? The no=\r\nrmal imagery painted elsewhere is of female deities with a separate form. H=\r\nere, they are depicted differently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fact that these female deiti=\r\nes are identical to\n the male counterparts in form, decoration, weapons and=\r\n vehicles suggests, to me, that they are not really separate from the male =\r\ncounterparts. Brahma and Brahmaani are not separate. Maheswara and Maaheswa=\r\nri are not separate. Vishnu and Vaishnavi are not separate. And so on. Brah=\r\nmaani is simply the shakti (vitality/energy) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simpl=\r\ny the shakti (vitality/energy) of Maheswara. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Vaishnavi=\r\n went on Garuda vehicle and killed a demon, it actually means that Vishnu w=\r\nent on a Garuda vehicle and killed the demon. Vaishanvi is the personificat=\r\nion of Vishnu&#39;s energy, which makes Vishnu be, think, desire, move and act.=\r\n Vaishnavi is not separate from Vishnu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, if you imagine Va=\r\nishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate person with certain attributes, She may man=\r\nifest limited by your imagination and even give you a darshan in that form.=\r\n However, that is a limited form and Her true nature is beyond that. Her tr=\r\nue and\n highest nature is that She is an inseparable part of Vishnu and rep=\r\nresents the energy of Vishnu. She is the part of Vishnu that makes Vishnu t=\r\nhink, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi is basically Chetana (animated consciousne=\r\nss) of Vishnu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, contemplation on these verses will make you und=\r\nerstand the true nature of male devatas and female devatas and their relati=\r\nonship better. It will enable you to appreciate the highest nature of Shakt=\r\ni.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Puranas personify everything to make things interesting and under=\r\nstandable by laymen. However, it is more fun to explore the deeper meanings=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) Take Raktabeeja&#39;s slaying. Raktabeeja is a demon with a specia=\r\nl ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body on the ground, another de=\r\nmon will be born from it and will be of the same size, age and strength as =\r\nthe original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishnavi, Maaheswari, Aindri etc=\r\n were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and more demons were being born=\r\n\n and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa told Kaali to expand her fac=\r\ne and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandika goes around the war gro=\r\nund eating all the demons as they are born and eventually Raktabeeja runs o=\r\nut of blood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This looks like a nice story. But, is there is a deeper=\r\n meaning in it that helps you in self-realization? Why was Kaali the chosen=\r\n one and not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The word rakta means=\r\n blood. Another meaning is &quot;desire/passion&quot; . The word comes from the root =\r\nranj/rang, which means &quot;to color&quot;. Desire/passion/ attachment colors and co=\r\nnditions the mind. Beeja means seed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raktabeeja means &quot;the seed of d=\r\nesire&quot;. Raktabeeja fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the better =\r\nof our good judgment and good qualities. Each human being is a microcosm of=\r\n the macrocosm that the universe is. All devatas reside in us as various go=\r\nod qualities and all demons reside in us as various undesirable\n qualities.=\r\n When we are overcome by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja within us=\r\n is defeating the gods within us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The thing is that desires are diff=\r\nicult to get rid of. You get rid of one desire and another desire is born. =\r\nThat is what Raktabeeja&#39;s special ability means. The &quot;seed of desires&quot; (i.e=\r\n. basic attachment that is the nature of mind) within us will keep producin=\r\ng more and more desires. It is very resourceful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then, why Kaali to =\r\ndestroy Him?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In astrology, we associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali wi=\r\nth Saturn. Kaali shows detachment and vairaagyam. She wears a garland of sk=\r\nulls, symbolizing that there is an endless cycle (garland) of births a mate=\r\nrial form (skull) goes thru. The way Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is v=\r\nairaagyam and detachment. She shows meaningful and highest level of vairaag=\r\nyam that comes with a deep understanding of the cycle of material forms.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To fully cut off the &quot;seed of desires&quot; so that one\n does not get any m=\r\nore desires, one needs to develop vairaagyam and detachment and keep on des=\r\ntroying desires as they are born and persist like that. After persisting fo=\r\nr a long time, the &quot;seed of desires&quot; will run out of desires and the basic =\r\nattachment of mind will vanish.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, simple stories have deep meani=\r\nngs. This particular story celebrates the value of detachment, vairaagyam a=\r\nnd persistence - Saturnine qualities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Merely chanting C=\r\nhandi saptashati without understanding the meaning is also excellent and pr=\r\noduces results. Understanding the meaning and marvelling at the power of th=\r\ne Mother makes one fearless and energetic and also give material benefits. =\r\nUnderstanding the deeper meanings and appreciating the True Nature of the M=\r\nother makes one realize one&#39;s own true nature. It has various benefits at v=\r\narious levels of sadhana. It is tough to exactly say what benefit it gives,=\r\n as that depends on the evolution level of\n sadhaka and his attitude. But, =\r\nthere is something in Chandipath for everyone!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, the highest =\r\npurpose is self-knowledge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*=\r\n * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Towards the end, the 11th chapter (titled &quot;Naaraayani Stuti&quot;) d=\r\nescribes gods praying to the Divine Mother after slaying all the demons. Th=\r\ney address Her as &quot;Naaraayani&quot; . Trimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of=\r\n the three gunas. Vishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains =\r\nthe creation. However, Narayana is different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Na=\r\nrayana sooktam with Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attribu=\r\ntes) . He is the Sahasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). =\r\nSome people may validly describe the same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let=\r\n us not argue about names. When we are essentially speaking about an entity=\r\n that is beyond attributes, it is foolish to argue about the name. After al=\r\nl, name too is an attribute that\n intends to describe other attributes! Tho=\r\nugh great people gave different names to Parama Purusha, the names essentia=\r\nlly capture the nature of the *path* those people took to experience the Pa=\r\nrama Purusha rather than the nature of Parama Purusha, which is beyond name=\r\ns and attributes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline is that there is a Parama Purusha a=\r\nbove the Trimurthis (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). IF we call him Narayana, th=\r\nen Narayani is His energy and She is the root cause of all manifested creat=\r\nion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saptashati is about Narayani. It is about the inseparable root =\r\nenergy of the Supreme Cosmic Being who is the source of this entire univers=\r\ne. A small part of that root energy lies within us too. Because I said &quot;sma=\r\nll part&quot;, don&#39;t think it is small. Even a small percentage of infinity is s=\r\ntill infinity. Though each of us is a microcosm of the macrocosm that the e=\r\nntire universe is, each of us is a complete and accurate replica of the ent=\r\nire universe. Think\n &quot;poornamadah poornamidam&quot; in Vedic spirit! The purpose=\r\n of all spiritual sadhana is realizing the true nature of self. Chandipath =\r\ncan also be viewed from that perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -----&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone queried a while back on=\r\n the meaning behind the story of Madhu Kaitabha. Here is a quick reply base=\r\nd on my limited understanding.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Madhu means honey. &quot;Madh=\r\nu keeta&quot; means an insect of honey, i.e. honey bee. Madhu kaita means belong=\r\ning to honey bees. It can be the qualities or nature of honey bees. One of =\r\nthe meanings of &quot;bha&quot; is &quot;having a similarity to&quot;. Thus, in my judgment, &quot;M=\r\nadhu Kaitabha&quot; means &quot;having a semblance to the nature of honey bees&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like I keep saying, Sanskrit is a fantastic language. Sansk=\r\nrit names selected by Rishis for expressing various concepts and stories ar=\r\ne very thoughtful. Depending on how deep one goes, there are many meanings =\r\nof the same\n word. Thus, Rishis expressed concepts that may have one meanin=\r\ng to a layman and a different meaning to one who is ready to understand the=\r\n deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of our Rishis!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was saying =\r\nthe same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last weekend. When somebody said at=\r\n an open discussion that the idea is important and not the name, as there a=\r\nre many names of the same thing in many languages, I made a quick point abo=\r\nut the value of Sanskrit names. I said that Sanskrit names have not one mea=\r\nning, but layers of meanings that can be understood based on the capability=\r\n of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some special meanings and to keep =\r\nsome higher knowledge as secret, even though it is very much out there! The=\r\n example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara described bhavas (houses) a=\r\nnd how to find their respective padas (arudha padas of houses) and said tha=\r\nt a bhava and its pada should be judged to see the matters of a house. Thou=\r\ngh he\n did not explain the difference between a bhava and its pada further =\r\nand did not elucidate when to use which one, I said that the very choice of=\r\n names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually translated as a house, also =\r\nmeans &quot;a thought/concept/ feeling&quot; and pada means &quot;a symbol/word&quot; used to e=\r\nxpress a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to their arudha padas what thoug=\r\nhts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attempt to express them. For exa=\r\nmple, if the 4th house shows one&#39;s happiness from vehicles, the pada of 4th=\r\n house shows the tangible articles that attempt to throw light on one&#39;s hap=\r\npiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle owned by one). Houses (bhav=\r\nas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter (just like thoughts inside=\r\n one&#39;s head), while their arudha padas show tangible/external aspects of a =\r\nmatter (just like the external words spoken that attempt to express the tho=\r\nughts in the head). If you use the English words to translate Parasara,\n th=\r\nis hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that Sanskrit names used by Ris=\r\nhis are not like words in any language.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, let us =\r\ncome back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I said, Madhu Kaitabha means &quot;hav=\r\ning a semblance to the quality of honeybees&quot;. What is the quality of honey =\r\nbees? Well, they keep working hard to accumulate the sweet honey! They are =\r\nnot intelligent enough to think about any higher things in life. Thus, Madh=\r\nu Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality within us which makes us work har=\r\nd, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus on accumulating material comf=\r\norts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accumulate material objects and s=\r\npend whole life working hard doing just that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vishnu is a personific=\r\nation of the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being). =\r\nWithin us, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna within us. Madhu Kaitab=\r\nha were born from Vishnu&#39;s earwax when He was alseep. The ability\n to work =\r\nhard like a bee is not really a terrible thing. This ability is essentially=\r\n born from the sattwa guna within us, when it is in deep slumber (i.e. satt=\r\nwa guna covered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna that &quot;manifests&quot; in a t=\r\naamasik way).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are so many good people in this world, who just =\r\nspend their entire lives in honest labor like the honeybees and accumulate =\r\nthings for themselves and others around them. Their sattwa is in deep sleep=\r\n and Madhu Kaitabha born from that asleep sattva are very much active.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;The problem with this focus on hard work and accumulation of material ob=\r\njects is that it keeps us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaitabha&#39;s attack =\r\non Brahma and Vedas is symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the supreme and li=\r\nberating knowledge of self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, symbolizes the=\r\n sadhana to achieve the supreme knowledge. The focus on working like honeyb=\r\nees and accumulating material objects tries to kills one&#39;s\n ability to do s=\r\nadhana and obtain supreme knowledge of self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vishnu battles Madhu Ka=\r\nitabha for 5,000 years. Devi Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu wondered=\r\n in the middle how to defeat Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite formida=\r\nble! Even when the sattva in us awakens, it is difficult for it to overcome=\r\n the formidable instinct to lead the life of a honeybee and to accumulate t=\r\nhe material objects for oneself and others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;According to Parasara, t=\r\nhighs are seen from the 9th house of dharma. The earthy element symbolizes =\r\nthe commitment and stability. The fact that earthy element came from the th=\r\nighs of Vishnu shows that it is the dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this u=\r\nniverse that ensures that there is commitment and stability in this creatio=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Moreover, it is apt that someone born in the ears (3rd house) of =\r\nVishnu found end in the thighs (9th house, i.e. 7th house of death from the=\r\n 3rd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, Brahma, who is\n born from the navel (6th =\r\nhouse) of Vishnu should naturally find His end in the 12th house of Vishnu =\r\n(feet/sleep) , which is the 7th house of death from the 6th house! That may=\r\n be why Vishnu goes to sleep, when there is a change of Brahma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyw=\r\nay, the instinct within us to keep accumulating material objects like honey=\r\n bees accumulate honey finds its end in the dharma of the sattwa guna, i.e.=\r\n when the sattwa guna within us follows its dharma. Then we are fully awake=\r\n spiritually. Naturally, the path to self-knowledge becomes open then and B=\r\nrahma becomes elated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the story of Madhu-Kaitabha refers, alle=\r\ngorically, to the instinct most of us have towards leading a &quot;regular&quot; life=\r\n, working hard like honeybees and accumulating objects for self and others =\r\nand how that instinct needs to be defeated by waking up the sattwa guna and=\r\n allowing it to perform its dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lest I am misunders=\r\ntood, I need to clarify one thing. I am\n not saying that these stories are =\r\nnot real. These stories ARE very much real. In fact, when a Yogi is able to=\r\n transport consciousness (Kundalini) to a particular plane (chakra), He/She=\r\n can vividly see these stories actually happening. The stories are as real =\r\nas our own existence as beings made of flesh and blood is, in the normal pl=\r\nane of consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What I am saying is that there is an allegoric=\r\nal link between various planes of consciousness. What is real in one plane =\r\nof consciousness is an allegory in another plane of consciousness. If one i=\r\ns atleast capable of understanding a story as an allegory, that will serve =\r\na valuable purpose!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo=\r\n.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@. ..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Dear Narasimhagaru,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you for your rep=\r\nly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I understand that Chandi and Lalita are t=\r\nwo different forms of the Universal Mother.=C3=82&nbsp;But what I am trying=\r\n to understand=C3=82&nbsp;is that how to worship both forms simultaneously.=\r\n For=C3=82&nbsp;instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer=\r\n (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shy=\r\nama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka.

I am very motivated to lea=\r\nrn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in S=\r\nri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krith=\r\nis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nagraj\n Kota&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n     =\r\n \r\n--0-703848077-1266774979=:25336--\r\n\n"}}
