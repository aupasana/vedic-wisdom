I want =\r\nto mention a small story about his\n&gt;&gt; past. This is an incident that had a =\r\nprofound impact on his spiritual\n&gt;&gt; evolution in this life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; When Manish was young, he was not exactly spiritual. His mother was\n&gt;&gt; h=\r\nighly spiritual and religious and he naturally knew some prayers, but\n&gt;&gt; di=\r\nd not do much spiritual sadhana. He would race motor bikes outside Pune\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nwith friends and lead a licentious lifestyle.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When in college, he got=\r\n bad marks in one subject in exams and wanted to\n&gt;&gt; go to college oneday to=\r\n fight and increase his marks. When he was about\n&gt;&gt; to leave house, a teena=\r\nged Brahmin in orange clothes and having good\n&gt;&gt; tejas in face came to his =\r\nhouse. He asked Manish where he was going. He\n&gt;&gt; then said, &quot;do not go out =\r\ntoday. Going out today will ruin your life.\n&gt;&gt; Just stay home and think of =\r\ngod. I will make sure that your marks with be\n&gt;&gt; increased. Leave it to me =\r\nand don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He then strongly\n&gt;&gt; suggested to Manish that he =\r\nshould wear a diamond ring on his right hand\n&gt;&gt; index finger and it would c=\r\nhange his life. Interestingly, Manish has\n&gt;&gt; Meena lagna and Venus is a mal=\r\nefic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th\n&gt;&gt; house) with 3 other planets,=\r\n people would normally avoid diamond in this\n&gt;&gt; case to be safe. Moreover, =\r\nmost people do not put diamond on index\n&gt;&gt; finger, which is associated with=\r\n Jupiter, an enemy of Venus. So nobody\n&gt;&gt; would normally recommend him diam=\r\nond, that too on the index finger. This\n&gt;&gt; is an unusual suggestion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nThat brahmin boy then asked Manish to give him tea or sugar with his hand\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; and said that this act would do him good. There was no tea at their house=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; and Manish fed him some sugar. He ate it and left after saying, &quot;when y=\r\nou\n&gt;&gt; come to Shirdi next, come to so and so room in so and so place. That =\r\nis\n&gt;&gt; where I live. Also, I need to give a glass of water to your mother.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Please come to Shirdi with her.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Barely a minute after =\r\nhe left, Manish had a question and ran to the door\n&gt;&gt; of his compound wall.=\r\n He found no person in orange clothes walking on the\n&gt;&gt; road. He asked the =\r\npersons standing outside whether they could tell him\n&gt;&gt; in which direction =\r\na person who came out of the house in orange clothes\n&gt;&gt; had gone. They said=\r\n nobody went in or came out of the house in an hour.\n&gt;&gt; Manish went around =\r\nthe area to check if anybody saw a young Brahmin in\n&gt;&gt; orange clothes. Nobo=\r\ndy in that area saw anyone like that. So this seemed\n&gt;&gt; like a miracle. Man=\r\nish was puzzled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Later his marks in the exam were automatically incre=\r\nased and his problem\n&gt;&gt; was solved by itself, without his doing anything.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A few months later, they went to Shirdi. They wanted to me=\r\net that young\n&gt;&gt; Brahmin. They went to the place he mentioned. Manish&#39;s mot=\r\nher was waiting\n&gt;&gt; downstairs and they went upstairs to the room number men=\r\ntioned by him to\n&gt;&gt; find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody in that room a=\r\nnd there was a\n&gt;&gt; life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wall. When they=\r\n asked, they\n&gt;&gt; were told that that room had always been empty and only the=\r\n picture was\n&gt;&gt; there. Nobody ever lived in that room.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When they came=\r\n downstairs, Manish&#39;s mother told them that she suddenly\n&gt;&gt; became very thi=\r\nrsty and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink\n&gt;&gt; some water fr=\r\nom his hands and left in a hurry.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After this, Manish did =\r\nbuy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine\n&gt;&gt; visitor and wore it on his=\r\n right hand index finger. He still wears it.\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps wearing a strong mo=\r\nksha trikona lord&#39;s gem on the moksha finger\n&gt;&gt; (the four fingers represent=\r\n the 4 purusharthas and thumb shows self)\n&gt;&gt; strengthens moksha trikona. Th=\r\nough this was an unusual (and risky)\n&gt;&gt; suggestion, perhaps this is very ap=\r\npropriate in this case for spiritual\n&gt;&gt; progress.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Soon after this, an=\r\nother miraculous incident involving a deity happened,\n&gt;&gt; which I do not wan=\r\nt to mention now. Then started his spiritual\n&gt;&gt; transformation. Manish beca=\r\nme very serious about spiritual sadhana after\n&gt;&gt; that and started spending =\r\nmany hours everyday in spiritual sadhana. He\n&gt;&gt; had visions - internal and =\r\nexternal - of many deities and special beings,\n&gt;&gt; including Shirdi Sai Baba=\r\n too, and had many experiences. His life changed\n&gt;&gt; completely after this e=\r\nxperience.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Today many people do not believe that miraculo=\r\nus and magical things can\n&gt;&gt; happen. When they hear unbelievable stories ab=\r\nout saints like Sai Baba,\n&gt;&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Tr=\r\nilinga Swami, Mahavatar\n&gt;&gt; Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds=\r\n trained in rational\n&gt;&gt; thinking assume that the stories are made up by som=\r\neone. Healthy\n&gt;&gt; skepticism is justified because many fake people are there=\r\n today, who\n&gt;&gt; abuse people&#39;s faith. However, absolute cynicism is wrong. S=\r\nuch things\n&gt;&gt; are possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But one word on miracles and siddhis. Mir=\r\nacles and siddhis are secondary\n&gt;&gt; to self-realization. The important thing=\r\n is to do spiritual sadhana,\n&gt;&gt; realize self, and live as a liberated perso=\r\nn (jeevanmukta) continuing to\n&gt;&gt; discharge the job assigned to one by Natur=\r\ne, with an equanimous mind and\n&gt;&gt; neither attraction nor repulsion to anyth=\r\ning. Nature assigns different\n&gt;&gt; jobs to different persons. Personalities l=\r\nike Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi,\n&gt;&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar\n&gt;&gt; Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, =\r\nRamanujacharya,\n&gt;&gt; Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did different jobs on thi=\r\ns earth, but what\n&gt;&gt; is common between them is that they completely overcam=\r\ne their limited\n&gt;&gt; personalities, became realized and then went on to fulfi=\r\nll the tasks\n&gt;&gt; given to them by the Power that runs the universe, with an =\r\nequanimous\n&gt;&gt; mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
