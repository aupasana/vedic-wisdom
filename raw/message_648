Or only a theoritical concept? \n \nAb=\r\nsolutely.\n \nOnce Ramakrishna Paramahamsa wanted to give some siddhis (mysti=\r\ncal abilities) to Vivekananda. Vivekananda asked &quot;will they help me realize=\r\n Self&quot;. Ramakrishna said &quot;no&quot;. Vivekananda said &quot;then I do not want them. L=\r\net me first realize Self. Then we will see.&quot;\n \nThings obtained before one i=\r\ns ready are detrimental to progress. Things like mystical experiences, myst=\r\nical abilities etc are actually like a detour on the path of self-realizati=\r\non. When they happen to one still with an ego, they may fan the flame of eg=\r\no rather than extinguish it. When a realized soul gets them, they do no har=\r\nm. But when an unprepared person gets them, they can spoil one.\n \nAccepting=\r\n what nature gives us without our asking for is fine, but craving for thing=\r\ns is not good, mystical experiences included.\n \nSelf-realization comes when=\r\n ego is completely effaced. Mystical experiences are neither necessary nor =\r\nsufficient for that. As I said before:\n \n&quot;If you normally feel sad or angry=\r\n or upset when someone criticizes you badly and you are now able to feel no=\r\nrmal in that situation, isn&#39;t that a &quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress? If you no=\r\nrmally feel elated when someone praises you to the sky and you are now able=\r\n to feel normal in that situation, isn&#39;t that a &quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress=\r\n?\n \nInstead of focusing your senses outward and looking for some miracle or=\r\n an &quot;extraordinaty experience&quot;, focus your senses inward, watch your though=\r\nts and instincts closely and refine them. Try to reach a state where critic=\r\nism and praise are the same for you.&quot;\n \nControl over the mind and senses an=\r\nd control over the six internal enemies (lust, anger, greed, delusion, want=\r\nonness and jealosy) are a far more accurate metric to judge the spiritual p=\r\nrogress. If one watches one&#39;s own thoughts and instincts honestly, one shou=\r\nld be able to know what is happening inside the mind.\n \nI know someone who =\r\ndid not even have an awakened Kundalini and had no mystical experiences of =\r\nany kind but had Kundalini reach sahasrara directly oneday, went into nirvi=\r\nkalpa samadhi, stayed in it for 7 days and returned after 7 days as a brahm=\r\na jnaani to lead a different life. Of course, it was possible due to the pu=\r\nrity generated for several years before that.\n \nInstead of focusing on the =\r\n*symptoms* and recreating the symptoms observed by some people when they ma=\r\nde spiritual progress, it will be productive if one focuses on the root. Mi=\r\nnd and its ego are the root of all bondage we experience. Reduction of the =\r\nego is the solution that frees one. Other things like mystical experiences,=\r\n mystical abilities, visions, Kundalini rise etc are symptoms and not the r=\r\noot. If one is successful in recreating the symptoms without making much pr=\r\nogress on the root, it is futile really.\n \nWhatever path one follows, one w=\r\nill do well to cut down on all cravings - including those for mystical expe=\r\nriences - and be vigiliant in observing one&#39;s thoughts and instincts. There=\r\n is no substitute to cutting the ego, if one is genuinely interested in sel=\r\nf-realization.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: raja=\r\nrshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, November 1=\r\n1, 2008 2:27 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Experiences (Re: Shri Shri TH=\r\nAKUR is still alive today)\n\n\n        One person may be seeing visions of de=\r\nities, experiencing mystical things \n        and another person may not be =\r\nexperiencing any such &quot;extraordinary&quot; things. \n        Yet, the latter may =\r\nrealize Self first.

These expectations are a big obstacle.\n\n=\r\n          If you normally feel sad or angry or upset when someone criticize=\r\ns you badly \n          and you are now able to feel normal in that situatio=\r\nn, isn&#39;t that a \n          &quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress?

If you make real \n          progress and do not bother about any =\r\n&quot;extraordinary experiences&quot; , you may \n          indeed have an extraordina=\r\nry experience oneday! Not the one that gets you \n          stuck with a sen=\r\nse of possessiveness or entitlement, but the one that frees \n          you.=\r\n\n\n          &gt; If i think rationally and take the experiences of others than=\r\n it is\n          &gt; quite clear that the spiritual growth invariably comes a=\r\nlong with\n          &gt; some out of the world and tangiable experiences. this=\r\n some times\n          &gt; temporarily disappoints me.\n\n          One can get =\r\nstuck in some expectations that are unknowingly formed in the \n          mi=\r\nnd based on what one read or heard.\n\n          One can get stuck in possess=\r\niveness or a sense of entitlement over an \n          &quot;extraordinary experie=\r\nnce&quot; that actually happened to him.\n\n          One can get stuck in many wa=\r\nys.\n\n          If you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations.

The extent to which\n          he\n          &gt; imbibed the upa=\r\nnishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actions, the\n          depth of\n   =\r\n       &gt; his sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolute lack of\n    =\r\n      personal ego\n          &gt; in him are the real miracles to me. Other mi=\r\nracles are useful to\n          instill\n          &gt; faith and confidence in =\r\nsome people. But they do not do justice to\n          his\n          &gt; person=\r\nality. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very conscious of\n          possibly\n=\r\n          &gt; limiting Thakur&#39;s personality to a bunch of miracles and was\n  =\r\n        concerned if\n          &gt; books on him would be able to do justice t=\r\no his personality.\n          &gt;\n          &gt; If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa tranf=\r\normed a bunch of youngsters into\n          spiritual\n          &gt; giants who=\r\n affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila\n          Prabhupada=\r\n\n          &gt; transformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who change=\r\nd the\n          world,\n          &gt; it was possible because of their *total*=\r\n surrender to the Lord and\n          the\n          &gt; zeroness of their pers=\r\nonal ego. *That* is a true miracle.\n          &gt;\n          &gt; I do not want t=\r\no downplay the discussion of other tangible\n          miracles. But I\n     =\r\n     &gt; do not want people to lose track of the crux of the matter.\n        =\r\n  &gt;\n          &gt; Ramakrishna could do miracles because he had no ego and sur=\r\nrendered\n          fully to\n          &gt; Her. *She* did everything for him.\n=\r\n          &gt;\n          &gt; As I said earlier, a person with normal ego can do =\r\nsome things; a\n          person\n          &gt; with very little personal ego c=\r\nan do tremendous things; and, a\n          person with\n          &gt; *no* pers=\r\nonal ego can do *any* thing. Our goal should be to\n          eradicate\n    =\r\n      &gt; personal ego through constant vigilance and total surrender.\n      =\r\n    &gt;\n          &gt; Best regards,\n          &gt; Narasimha\n          &gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n          &gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          &gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          =\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          &gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          &gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n         =\r\n &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n       =\r\n   &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n    =\r\n      &gt;\n          &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n          &gt; From: &quot;utpal =\r\npathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n          &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com=\r\n&gt;\n          &gt; Sent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM\n          &gt; Subject: =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n          &gt;\n      =\r\n    &gt;\n          &gt; Namaste,\n          &gt;\n          &gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka tol=\r\nd me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma\n          &gt; Acharya was born as T=\r\nhakur Ramkrishna in previous life.\n          &gt;\n          &gt; Another as intre=\r\nsting as well as equally confusing thing is that\n          &gt; Late Shri Yoge=\r\nshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about\n          &gt; his past li=\r\nfe and he also indirectly indicated in his biography that\n          &gt; he wa=\r\ns Thakur Ramkrishna in the previous birth.\n          &gt;\n          &gt; Yours,\n =\r\n         &gt;\n          &gt; Utpal\n          &gt;\n          &gt; I know\n          &gt;\n   =\r\n       &gt;\n          &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblis=\r\nswithin@ &gt;\n          &gt; wrote:\n          &gt; &gt;\n          &gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinj=\r\ni\n          &gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.\n          &gt; &gt; I w=\r\nould like to mention something that may be an interesting\n          &gt; insig=\r\nht.\n          &gt; &gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

There was a Telephone ex=\r\nchange just opposite to Post\n          &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=C3=A2=\r\n?Tt; I had friendship with some\n          &gt; Telephone\n          &gt; &gt; operato=\r\nrs. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr.\n          Patel)\n    =\r\n      &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n =C3=82 shri\n          &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was=\r\n always talking\n          &gt; about\n          &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close =\r\nday by day. There was a weekly\n          &gt; gathering at\n          &gt; &gt; his h=\r\nome called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created\n          &gt; by=\r\n\n          &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna=\r\n\n          &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekl=\r\ny\n          &gt; meeting\n          &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 year=\r\ns old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n          &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seasho=\r\nre daily at 7 pm after duty\n          hours\n          &gt; &gt; and were talking =\r\nonly about Thakur.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he sud=\r\ndenly told me--\n          &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,\n          &gt; &gt; some guest hav=\r\ne come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\n          &gt; son\n       =\r\n   &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=C3=A2?=\r\n\n          =EF=BF=BD. -\n          &gt; -\n          &gt; &gt; And with my surprise hi=\r\ns 8 years old son came to call him.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident=\r\n he told me that there will be a plane\n          &gt; crash\n          &gt; &gt; tomo=\r\nrrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about\n          &gt; hi=\r\nm.\n          &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka=\r\n by Bus,\n          &gt; he\n          &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus=\r\n tire will be punctured. Yet\n          I\n          &gt; &gt; went to Bus station =\r\nbut bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n          &gt; punctured\n          &gt; &gt;=\r\n on the way. This was surprising.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made m=\r\ne to believe that he had some super\n          &gt; power\n          &gt; &gt; and thi=\r\ns was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n          &gt; &gt; s=\r\nhri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n          =\r\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\n       =\r\n   &gt; myself\n          &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thak=\r\nur picture. I prayed\n          &gt; him\n          &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to =\r\naccept me as his follower and bestow his\n          &gt; grace.\n          &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n         =\r\n &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\n        =\r\n  &gt; waking\n          &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morni=\r\nng that I have\n          &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My =\r\nwife was annoyed and\n          &gt; she\n          &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =\r\n=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such a hasty\n          &gt; decision?\n    =\r\n      &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta.

I thought-- yes I have ta=\r\nken\n          &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n =\r\n         &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was\n  =\r\n        telling\n          &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting =\r\nhim. I also decided\n          to\n          &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately t=\r\nold my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel\n          &gt; has\n          &gt;=\r\n &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him.

Read the&lt;BR&gt;teachings.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; More \n          importantly, try to *walk* the path. Imbibe the teachin=\r\ngs \n          in&lt;BR&gt;your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thinking and in your common sense. Your ac=\r\ntions and \n          thoughts should&lt;BR&gt;reflect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the teachings. Focu=\r\ns on the \n          teachings of the saint, digest them&lt;BR&gt;fully and&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; base your \n          thoughts and actions on them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Regarding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. =\r\nThe extent to \n          which&lt;BR&gt;he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; imbibed the upanishadic philos=\r\nophy in his thoughts \n          and actions, the&lt;BR&gt;depth of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his se=\r\nnse of surrender to the \n          Mother and the absolute lack of&lt;BR&gt;perso=\r\nnal ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in him are the \n          real miracles to me. Other miracl=\r\nes are useful to&lt;BR&gt;instill&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          faith and confidence in some=\r\n people. But they do not do justice \n          to&lt;BR&gt;his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personalit=\r\ny. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very \n          conscious of&lt;BR&gt;possibly&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; limiting Thakur&#39;s personality to a \n          bunch of miracles and=\r\n was&lt;BR&gt;concerned if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; books on him would \n          be able to do ju=\r\nstice to his personality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If \n          Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa tranformed a bunch of youngsters \n          into&lt;BR&gt;spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ngiants who affected the spirituality of \n          generations and if Srila=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Prabhupada&lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformed many fallen \n          souls into excell=\r\nent saints who changed the&lt;BR&gt;world,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it was \n          possible bec=\r\nause of their *total* surrender to the Lord \n          and&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; z=\r\neroness of their personal ego. *That* is a true \n          miracle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do not want to downplay the discussion of \n          other tangi=\r\nble&lt;BR&gt;miracles. But I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; do not want people to lose \n          track =\r\nof the crux of the matter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna could do \n          =\r\nmiracles because he had no ego and surrendered&lt;BR&gt;fully to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n       =\r\n   Her. *She* did everything for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As I said earlier, \n =\r\n         a person with normal ego can do some things; a&lt;BR&gt;person&lt;BR&gt;&gt; w=\r\nith \n          very little personal ego can do tremendous things; and, a&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;person \n          with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *no* personal ego can do *any* thing. Our g=\r\noal should be \n          to&lt;BR&gt;eradicate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personal ego through const=\r\nant vigilance and \n          total surrender.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- \n          --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;=\r\nA \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\n\n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Do \n          Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Spirituality: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; \n          target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdo=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://vedi=\r\ncastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nvedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free \n          Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; \n          target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        =\r\n  Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.srij=\r\nagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJaga=\r\nn nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ \n          --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          ----- Original Message =\r\n----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; \n          &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: \n          Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: \n          Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one Gayatri Upa=\r\nasaka told me many years back \n          that Shri Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Achar=\r\nya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in \n          previous life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Another as intresting as well as \n          equally confusing thing is t=\r\nhat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A \n          Gujarati yogi) had also rev=\r\nealtion about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his past life and he \n          also indirectly indic=\r\nated in his biography that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he was Thakur \n          Ramkrishna in t=\r\nhe previous birth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Yours,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I \n          know&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \n      =\r\n    href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n       =\r\n   rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Shiv&quot; \n          &lt=\r\n;theblisswithin@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          R=\r\nespected Ashwinji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring \n         =\r\n thread.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I would like to mention something that may be an \n   =\r\n       interesting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; insight.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram \n=\r\n          Sharma Acharya.

I am going=\r\n back to the period of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kindly read=\r\n this only when you are in religious \n          mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as \n          telegraphist at Okha Port=\r\n Post office near&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; My duty was from =\r\n7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee \n          allowance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone \n          exchange just oppos=\r\nite to Post&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; office and due to same \n          Dep=C3=A2?Tt; I =\r\nhad friendship with some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          operator=\r\ns. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as \n          Mr.&lt;BR&gt;Patel)&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch \n          devotee of=\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was \n     =\r\n     meeting him he was always talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; shri \n   =\r\n       Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gatheri=\r\nng \n          at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devo=\r\ntional \n          songs created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him and was weeping=\r\n while \n          singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kathamrit=\r\na. We 10 to \n          12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mee=\r\nting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. =\r\nMr. Patel was of \n          30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to sea=\r\nshore daily at 7 pm \n          after duty&lt;BR&gt;hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and were ta=\r\nlking only about \n          Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were =\r\nat sea shore he \n          suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some guest have \n          come to my home and my wife is rememb=\r\nering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; will come in a few minutes=\r\n to call me. I shall have to go \n          now=C3=A2?&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years \n          old son came =\r\nto call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he \n          told m=\r\ne that there will be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tomorrow \n         =\r\n and that also happened. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n         =\r\n him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to \n   =\r\n       Dwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus=\r\n, \n          as bus tire will be punctured. Yet&lt;BR&gt;I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; went to B=\r\nus \n          station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    =\r\n      punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n          &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some \n   =\r\n       super&lt;BR&gt;&gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev \n=\r\n          worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One da=\r\ny I \n          thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thak=\r\nur and the \n          day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n          myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house be=\r\nfore Thakur \n          picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deeply fr=\r\nom my heart to \n          accept me as his follower and bestow his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ngrace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion wit=\r\nh my wife at 6.10 \n          morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As =\r\nmy duty was to start \n          from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n up at 5.45 morning. I told \n          to my wife in the morning that I hav=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accepted Shri \n          Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wif=\r\ne was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; argued with me a lot.=\r\n =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such \n          a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; decisi=\r\non?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a \n          devotee of Maa Kali=\r\n at Calcutta.

I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n          But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that=\r\n Thakur \n          was&lt;BR&gt;telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their disciples to test him =\r\nbefore \n          accepting him. I also decided&lt;BR&gt;to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; test Tha=\r\nkur. I \n          immediately told my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Pa=\r\ntel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; never come to our home. You have al=\r\nso not seen him.
