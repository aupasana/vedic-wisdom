It is a=\r\n tradeoff ... if you want less smoke, it is better\n&gt; to clean it, but there=\r\n are also likely to be some partially burnt\n&gt; particles in the ash. If you =\r\nleave it, some small partially burnt\n&gt; particles may finish burning, but th=\r\nere is likely to be a little more\n&gt; smoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Disposing of ashes. As =\r\nNarasimha has written, you want to\n&gt; distribute the energy in the ashes bac=\r\nk to nature in a respectful way.\n&gt; Do whatever is possible given your const=\r\nraints. If no other\n&gt; alternative presents itself, throw them out in the ga=\r\nrbage.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) Twigs & Ghee -- The twigs are dipped in ghee before they ar=\r\ne\n&gt; offered. After that you offer ghee ahutis to the fire (and thus, the\n&gt; =\r\ntwigs) until they burn.\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) Copper vs Iron -- Narasimha has told us th=\r\nat iron is unlikely to\n&gt; have a good mix of gunas, and copper is a much bet=\r\nter choice. If you\n&gt; have to get a new kunda, why not get a copper one?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; (6) Size -- The size of the homa kinda is a matter of preference based\n&gt; =\r\non the size of the fire that you light. With a smaller kunda, you may\n&gt; hav=\r\ne trouble exposing all sides of all ahutis to air, which might\n&gt; prevent th=\r\nem from burning well. With a larger kunda, if you don&#39;t keep\n&gt; an equivalen=\r\ntly large fire ablaze, you may have more smoke. Once you\n&gt; do homam repeate=\r\ndly, you will figure out if you need (or want) a kunda\n&gt; of a different siz=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) Washing & Cleaning -- You do not have to wash the kunda daily\n&gt;=\r\n (though you can if you choose to). It is a good idea to keep the\n&gt; prayer =\r\narea relatively clean ... you should be comfortable with it.\n&gt; Using someth=\r\ning like aluminum foil can make regular cleanup easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; (8) Bali -- Afte=\r\nr puja, bali is offered to animals, and is not\n&gt; consumed by us. If this is=\r\n not possible, you can throw it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; (9) Base of the kunda -- Putting =\r\nthe kunda on newspaper is a bad idea\n&gt; ... it may easily catch on fire. A w=\r\nooden plank may work, though it is\n&gt; better if it is raised (i.e. has a gap=\r\n of air between the main plank\n&gt; and the ground). Even with a wooden plank,=\r\n two bricks between the\n&gt; plank and kunda is a good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you hav=\r\ne extra free time, consider searching the group archives\n&gt; for these same q=\r\nuestions. You&#39;ll come across many other interesting\n&gt; points from previous =\r\ndiscussions on the same topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 11:45 PM, Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Oh ! and lastly, what do I do with the &quot;bali&quot; fruit pieces =\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ra=\r\nma V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, I bought a metal homa kund (not=\r\n copper, probably iron), 6x6 inches in the interior and probably a sq.ft ex=\r\nterior.

Can I use i=\r\nt tomorrow ? Also, what does one do with all the ash and the burnt part? Wh=\r\nat is the holy way to dispose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! =\r\nDo I put them under a tree and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, in=\r\n the apts I live here.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs=\r\n, can I use them again? Or do they need to be disposed off ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Is i=\r\nt advisable to dip (not pour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well =\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let me know of other points I might have known for a beginn=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, a million thanks and appreciations for all who a=\r\nre responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) for the KT.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--0-927737581-1309243470=:26608\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN=\r\n style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Namaste,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Apologies but I disagr=\r\nee with the option mentioned..... dispose ashes in the garbage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SP=\r\nAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Narsimha ji had mentioned throwing ash in the =\r\nocean as the best solution.

A wooden plank may work, though it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; better if i=\r\nt is raised (i.e. has a gap of air between the main plank&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and the g=\r\nround). Even with a wooden plank, two bricks between the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; plank and =\r\nkunda is a good idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you have extra free time, consi=\r\nder searching the group archives&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for these same questions. You&#39;ll c=\r\nome across many other interesting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; points from previous discussions =\r\non the same topics.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bhavadiiyaH,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &=\r\nnbsp;ajit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 11:45 PM, Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Oh ! and lastly, what do I do with the &quot;bali&quot; fruit\n pieces=\r\n ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rAma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, I bought a metal homa kund (not copper, proba=\r\nbly iron), 6x6 inches in the interior and probably a sq.ft exterior.

The small copper=\r\n ones I have seen at the shop do not have stands and they are like 2x2 inch=\r\n interior or max of 3x3inches. What is the ideal size for a daily homam kum=\r\nd?

I learnt that th=\r\ne twigs need to be cut vertically for them to burn better.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Secondly, the full dry coconut did not burn completely in the poornah=\r\nuti and if I put a half one or a piece it would have burnt completely.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Also, the dharbhas I have were a bit bent and I could not=\r\n put them pointed to north or south or the other directions correctly. Hope=\r\n that was ok too !&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n Now some qu=\r\nestions (I am sure these have been answered, I apologize, but would appreci=\r\nate if you respond again); btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much =\r\nobliged.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. what do I do with the partially burnt poo=\r\nrnahuti ? Can I use it tomorrow ? Also, what does one do with all the ash a=\r\nnd the burnt part? What is the holy way to dispose it off ? No lakes or riv=\r\ner by in Bangalore ! Do I put them under a tree and pour water ? Not many t=\r\nrees, only plants, in the apts I live here.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If the=\r\nre are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use them again? Or do they need=\r\n to be disposed off ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Is it advisable to dip (not =\r\npour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let me know of other points I might have known for a =\r\nbeginner.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, a million th=\r\nanks and appreciations for all who are responsible (Sh\n MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) =\r\nfor the KT.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt; rAma&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-927737581-1309243470=:26608--\r\n\n"}}
