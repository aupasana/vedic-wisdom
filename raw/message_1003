Shriram Sharma Acharya=\r\n\nDear ALL,\n\nSleep is a biological need of man. It is essential for the smoo=\r\nth running of\nlife. Like hunger and thirst, it too comes at fixed cyclic in=\r\ntervals. It\nenergizes the body and freshens the mind. Lapsing into sound sl=\r\neep is an\nart; it is not something haphazard. Those who are skilled in this=\r\n art are\nable to put it to optimum advantage.\n\nAyurveda gives very deep ana=\r\nlysis of sleep. It classifies sleep into six\nkinds: (i) sleep generated by =\r\nphysical exhaustion, (ii) caused by mental\nfatigue, (iii) post-ailment slee=\r\np, (iv) sleep induced by some bodily hurt,\n(v) that brought about by increa=\r\nse in cough, and (vi) tamoguni sleep. This\nlast kind fills the body and min=\r\nd with &#39;tamas&#39; or darkness instead of\nfreshness and vigor. Death is known a=\r\ns the mahatamoguni sleep. The physical\ndeath of yogis, however, is called &#39;=\r\ndivine sleep&#39;.\n\nModern psychology divides sleep into three phase-types: lig=\r\nht sleep, deep\nsleep and the dreaming phase. These phases come in successio=\r\nn. In the deep\nsleep state, a person becomes completely oblivious of his su=\r\nrroundings and\nremains totally unaffected by them. Scientists believe that =\r\nit is this phase\nwhich is the real sleep time. It takes away all mental and=\r\n physical\ntiredness and fills a person with energy and vitality.\n\nIn the th=\r\nird phase of dreaming, the conscious mind takes a back seat and the\nunconsc=\r\nious mind becomes active. It is this mind, which &#39;sees&#39; dreams. The\npsychol=\r\nogists are still not able to fully grasp the mechanism and meaning of\ndream=\r\ns. But the yogi understands this phenomenon in its totality. Through\nvariou=\r\ns yogic techniques he refines and purifies his unconscious mind to the\nexte=\r\nnt where it becomes non-existent. The yogi acquires full control over\nsleep=\r\n. He does not dream; rather he illumines this dream phase with the\nbright r=\r\nainbow-like lights of a Deepawali.\n\nAn ordinary person requires sleep becau=\r\nse his unconscious has a vast\nocean-like expanse. But how much sleep is rea=\r\nlly needed? Psychologists opine\nthat the required quantum of sleep varies f=\r\nrom person to person. It depends\non many factors =96 physical and psycholog=\r\nical state of a person as well as on\nhis social and material environs. A ch=\r\nild who sleeps for 15 hours can hardly\nmanage a sleep of even 4-5 hours in =\r\nold age. The thumb rule is that only\nthat much sleep is required as fulfill=\r\ns the requirements of the body and\nmind. Napoleon slept for only 3 hours wh=\r\nile Einstein for 10. On an average,\na person sleeps for 5 =96 7 hours.\n\r\n--001636456fd618cd7c04615f629b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Source : &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.awgp.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgp.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.awgpsouth.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgpsouth.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author : Pt.
