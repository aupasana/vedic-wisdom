He alone knows also the truth about the world because of his\naw=\r\nareness of the reality [the Self] in that state.\n\nThis will become intellig=\r\nible as we proceed.\n\n80 The sage not only testifies to his own experience, =\r\nbut also furnishes\nflawless reasons [drawn from our own worldly experience]=\r\n. But the disciple,\nif wise, will not go on posing questions without end, f=\r\nor the world of the\nsaviour is not to be doubted by the aspirant.\n\nThe sage=\r\n=E2=80=99s own experience is for us conclusive evidence. He is the\ncompassi=\r\nonate one, the saviour who has assumed human form for redeeming\nthose who h=\r\nave begun to feel the illusory quality of worldly life. So, one\nmust as a r=\r\nule accept what he says without cavil. At some state the series\nof question=\r\ns must come to an end, and the way to the verification of the\ntruth by one=\r\n=E2=80=99s own experience must be entered upon. As the Gita says: =E2=80=98=\r\nThe\ninveterate doubter does not win the goal of life.=E2=80=99\n\n81 There wi=\r\nll be no end to doubt until one gets established in the supreme\nstate. Only=\r\n in that state is there an end of all doubts, due to the\nextinction of the =\r\ndoubter, [the ego].\n\nHere is a reference to the upanishadic text: =E2=80=98=\r\nWhen the one that is the truth\nof the high and the low is experienced, then=\r\n the heart-knot is cut, all\ndoubts are dispelled, and all his actions are l=\r\niquidated.=E2=80=99\n\nDoubts, we are here told, arise in the ego-ridden mind=\r\n, not in the egoless\nstate.\nWhat then must the aspirant do?\n\n82 Since there=\r\n is no finality in reason, the aspirant should at once give up\nreliance on =\r\nreason. With faith in the Master=E2=80=99s teaching, he must strive to\nwin =\r\nGod on the lines taught by him.\n\n83 If a doubt arises he should ask himself=\r\n: =E2=80=98Who is it that doubts in this\nway?=E2=80=99 If by thus seeking, =\r\nhe attains the supreme state, then both doubt and\ndoubter will cease to be.=\r\n\n\nThe question =E2=80=98Who is it that has this doubt?=E2=80=99 is the mean=\r\ns prescribed by\nBhagavan to turn the mind away from the doubt to the doubte=\r\nr, the ego. The\nanswer to this question will be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. From t=\r\nhis the question will arise, =E2=80=98Who\nAm I?=E2=80=99, which is the ques=\r\nt. In the same way, any extraneous thought that\nintrudes, distracting the m=\r\nind from the quest, can be used as a means of\nreturning to the quest. If th=\r\ne quest is persistently pursued in this way,the\nego, the doubter, becomes e=\r\nxtinct, and no more doubts will arise because the\nmind-free state is then a=\r\nttained.\n\nNow we come to the question, =E2=80=98Is the world real?=E2=80=99=\r\n Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching on\nthis point is given in the next seven verse=\r\ns.\n\n84 The Guru, who is a sage, teaches the unreality of the world in accor=\r\ndance\nwith his own experience, also giving reasons supporting it. The disci=\r\nple who\naspires to become\nfree should accept this teaching with perfect fai=\r\nth and [with its help]\nstrive for this goal.\n\n85 The universe, comprising t=\r\nhese three =E2=80=93 the soul, God and the world of\nvisible objects =E2=80=\r\n=93 is superimposed by the mind on the real Self, which is the\nsole reality=\r\n of the supreme state. Hence all this [universe] is just an\noutcome of igno=\r\nrance.\nThe mind is the creator of the universe. Ignorance is the primal cau=\r\nse of\nthe mind. Hence it is said here that this ignorance is the cause of t=\r\nhe\nuniverse.\n\n86 That being so, when this ignorance is annihilated by the l=\r\night of\nawareness of that Self, then, along with it, the consequence of it =\r\n[the\nworld] will, like the darkness that disappears before sunlight at dawn=\r\n,\ncease to appear.\n\nThis will become more and more intelligible as we proce=\r\ned. What is stated\nabove are the actual facts of the Guru=E2=80=99s own exp=\r\nerience. The conclusion that\nfollows for the disciple is given next.\n\n87 Th=\r\nis universe [we see] shines in the dense darkness of ignorance, but\ndoes no=\r\nt shine in the great splendour of the light of Self-awareness. If\nthis univ=\r\nerse were real, why does it not shine in the supreme state, lit as\nit is by=\r\n the conscious, effulgent light of the real Self?\n\nAn axiomatic distinction=\r\n between the real and unreal, which is implicit in\nvedantic metaphysics, is=\r\n next enunciated.\n\n88 That which survives in the experience of the real Sel=\r\nf is the supreme\nstate. [That] alone is real. All else is only unreal. This=\r\n is the\ndistinction between the real and the unreal, revealed to us by the =\r\nteachings\nof all the sages.\n\nBy this test the world is shown to be unreal. =\r\nThe next verse elaborates on\nthis.\n\n89 Since multiplicity is experienced on=\r\nly in the state of ignorance, it is\ndeclared to be unreal. On the other han=\r\nd, because the unity of the Self is\nexperienced on the liquidation of ignor=\r\nance, that unity is real.\n\nIt may be questioned: =E2=80=98If ignorance is t=\r\notal darkness, how can anything be\nexperienced in this state?=E2=80=99 The =\r\nexplanation is that this ignorance is not\nlike perfect darkness, but like a=\r\n greatly diminished light. In dim light a\nrope is not invisible; it is mere=\r\nly perceived wrongly as a snake. In the\nsame way, in ignorance, what is rea=\r\nl, the Self, is not invisible; it is\nmistakenly taken to be the world.\n\nThe=\r\n reality is only that which survives in the supreme state.\n\n90 =E2=80=98The=\r\n sole reality is that peaceful Self which shines by the light of its\nown na=\r\nture as pure consciousness in the supreme state wherein the world is\nlost.=\r\n=E2=80=99 Such is the teaching of our holy Guru.\n\nHere it is shown that the=\r\n state is one of peace because there is no duality\nthere. This is what we l=\r\nearn from all the Upanishads.This teaching is\nfurther confirmed by the anal=\r\nogy of the dream world.\n\n91 As the dream world is known to be unreal for th=\r\ne reason that it vanishes\nupon waking, so this waking world is also proved =\r\nto be unreal by its\nvanishing in the light of the real Self.\n\nIt is next po=\r\ninted out that those who seek to discredit this teaching are\nthose who do n=\r\not ardently aspire to the supreme state.\n\n92 But ignorant men, who are aver=\r\nse to winning the supreme state, put forth\nan endless series of arguments, =\r\n[trying to refute this teaching]. The sages\nclear the doubts generated by t=\r\nhese arguments so that earnest aspirants may\nnot be deluded by them.\n\nThe t=\r\neaching is addressed not to all men, but only to those who aspire to\nwin th=\r\ne supreme state, because they alone are qualified to receive it.\n\n93 This t=\r\neaching of the unreality of the world is not addressed to those who\nlook up=\r\non the body itself as the Self, or consider the Self to be the owner\nof the=\r\n body. For these people the world is real, not unreal.\n\nThe teaching has to=\r\n be adapted to the person being taught. The same teaching\nis not good for a=\r\nll. Here it is shown that he who believes that the Self is\nnot the body, bu=\r\nt the owner of it, or the dweller therein, is for this\npurpose in the same =\r\ncategory as the one who believes the body itself to be\nthe Self.\n\nWhy is it=\r\n that the world is real to these people?\n\n94 The teaching =E2=80=93 that th=\r\ne trinity of the soul, God and the world is unreal\n=E2=80=93 is indivisible=\r\n. If one is convinced that one of these is real, the other\ntwo also will ap=\r\npear to be real.\n\nThat is, the teaching must either be accepted as a whole =\r\nor rejected wholly.\nThere is no option to split it up and accept it partial=\r\nly, rejecting some of\nit.\n\n95 To those who seek deliverance, the teaching i=\r\ns that all these three are\nequally unreal. This teaching must [therefore] b=\r\ne accepted, exactly as it is\ntaught, by those who are earnestly seeking to =\r\nwin deliverance by the\nextinction of ignorance.\n\nFor different aspirants th=\r\nere are different paths prescribed. This\nparticular teaching is addressed o=\r\nnly to those who believe that for them\ndeliverance must come by right aware=\r\nness.\n\nAn analogy is next given to explain the indivisibility of the teachi=\r\nng.\n\n96 One who is wise will either accept the teaching as a whole, or reje=\r\nct the\nwhole of it. Who can make use of half of a hen for cooking, reservin=\r\ng the\nother half for laying eggs?\n\nA hen must be killed and cooked for food=\r\n, or the whole hen must be allowed\nto live for laying eggs. The same indivi=\r\nsibility is characteristic of this\nteaching.\n\nNow we come to a discussion o=\r\nf the objections of those who assert the\nperfect reality of the world.\n\nOn =\r\nwhat evidence do they base their belief?\n\n97 To begin with, it needs to be =\r\nconsidered why the world is taken to be\nreal. For the burden of proving the=\r\n reality of the world lies on him that\nasserts it, [not on those who simply=\r\n deny it].\n\n98 Everyone who is ignorant [of the real Self] thinks the world=\r\n is real\nbecause it is seen. This is no proof because it proves too much. T=\r\nhe same\nreason would prove the reality of the mirage, the rope in the snake=\r\n, etc.\n\nUsually, the knowledge that arises from seeing is mixed up with ima=\r\ngination,\nor a false impression of what is seen. This reason is therefore\ni=\r\nnconclusive.\n\nThe question then arises: =E2=80=98What does the seeing of th=\r\ne world prove?=E2=80=99\n\n99 The fact of being seen is not conclusive proof =\r\nthat the world exists\nexactly as imagined [by the seer]. From the seeing it=\r\n is proper to infer\nonly that there is a substratum in which the world appe=\r\nars.\n\nIn the first verse of Ulladu Narpadu Bhagavan says: =E2=80=98Because =\r\nwe see the\nworld, it is indisputable that there exists a first cause [subst=\r\nratum or\nbasic reality] which has the power to appear as many.=E2=80=99 In =\r\nthe same verse he\nproceeds to reveal, in the light of his own experience, t=\r\nhat that substratum\nis only the real Self, on which are superimposed the fo=\r\nur elements of the\nworld appearance, the pictures of names and forms, the s=\r\neeing individual\nsoul, the screen and the light. The seeing subject and the=\r\n spectacle seen\nform the appearance imposed on the substratum. The lighted =\r\nscreen is the\nsubstratum. Here the analogy of the cinema show is suggested.=\r\n The pictures,\nin which the seer is included, come and go, but the lighted =\r\nscreen exists\nunaffected throughout. The power by which the appearance is s=\r\nuperimposed on\nthe substratum is known as maya. All that is meant by callin=\r\ng the world =E2=80=98an\neffect of maya=E2=80=99 is that things are not what=\r\n they seem to those who have not\nknown the real Self as it really is.\n\n100 =\r\nEven scientists have proved that things are not exactly as they appear\n[to =\r\nthe seer], for they say that the solid-seeming objects are really little\nmo=\r\nre than empty space.\n\nAtomic physics now tells us that the atom is not a so=\r\nlid particle, but a\nclosed space in which electrons are rotating around a n=\r\nucleus, composed of\nprotons and neutrons, etc. The electrons rotate at diff=\r\nerent distances from\nthe nucleus. The whole atom thus resembles a solar sys=\r\ntem. That things are\nnot what they seem is thus indisputable. On the other =\r\nhand, there is no\nproof that things are what they seem to be. There is, in =\r\nfact, an antithesis\nbetween appearance and reality. It is this that is call=\r\ned maya, which is the\nillusion by which reality appears as the world, that =\r\nspectacle which\nresembles a cinema-show. Due to this illusion there is igno=\r\nrance (avidya)\nwhich works through the mind that wrongly identifies the bod=\r\ny as the Self.\nFor this reason the truth about the world is a profound myst=\r\nery, one that\ntranscends the human intellect, but it is no mystery to the s=\r\nage, who alone\nis competent to tell us the truth as it really is. The next =\r\nverse points\nthis out.\n\n101 Only the sage who knows the substratum of the w=\r\norld appearance, the\nreality, by being firmly established in the supreme st=\r\nate, is competent to\nreveal the truth of the world.\n\nBy his unawareness of =\r\nthat truth the common man, being a victim of his\nignorance, cannot know the=\r\n truth about the world.\n\n102 When vision is focused on the outside, who can=\r\n know the truth, whether\nof the real Self or of the world? But, with the mi=\r\nnd turned inwards, the\nsage knows the truth of both by the eye of right awa=\r\nreness.\n\nIt is with the knowledge of this uniqueness of the sage that the d=\r\nisciple\nhas to approach him and listen to his teaching.\n\nSource: http://www=\r\n.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00235429d3567cf498049f0bb521\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n79 For the aspirant who seeks to win the supreme state by transc=\r\nending the relativity [of the three states], the supreme evidence is the ex=\r\nperience of the sage.

But the disciple, if wise, will not go on posing =\r\nquestions without end, for the world of the saviour is not to be doubted by=\r\n the aspirant.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The sage=E2=80=99s own experience is for us conclus=\r\nive evidence. He is the compassionate one, the saviour who has assumed huma=\r\nn form for redeeming those who have begun to feel the illusory quality of w=\r\norldly life. So, one must as a rule accept what he says without cavil. At s=\r\nome state the series of questions must come to an end, and the way to the v=\r\nerification of the truth by one=E2=80=99s own experience must be entered up=\r\non. As the Gita says: =E2=80=98The inveterate doubter does not win the goal=\r\n of life.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;81 There will =\r\nbe no end to doubt until one gets established in the supreme state. Only in=\r\n that state is there an end of all doubts, due to the extinction of the dou=\r\nbter, [the ego].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here is a reference to the upanishadic tex=\r\nt: =E2=80=98When the one that is the truth of the high and the low is exper=\r\nienced, then the heart-knot is cut, all doubts are dispelled, and all his a=\r\nctions are liquidated.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doubts, we are here told, arise in t=\r\nhe ego-ridden mind, not in the egoless state.&lt;br&gt;\n\nWhat then must the aspir=\r\nant do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;82 Since there is no finality in reason, the aspirant should=\r\n at once give up reliance on reason. With faith in the Master=E2=80=99s tea=\r\nching, he must strive to win God on the lines taught by him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;83 If a doubt arises he should ask himself: =E2=\r\n=80=98Who is it that doubts in this way?=E2=80=99 If by thus seeking, he at=\r\ntains the supreme state, then both doubt and doubter will cease to be.&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The question =E2=80=98Who is it that has this doubt?=E2=80=99 i=\r\ns the means prescribed by Bhagavan to turn the mind away from the doubt to =\r\nthe doubter, the ego. The answer to this question will be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99. From this the question will arise, =E2=80=98Who Am I?=E2=80=99, which =\r\nis the quest. In the same way, any extraneous thought that intrudes, distra=\r\ncting the mind from the quest, can be used as a means of returning to the q=\r\nuest. If the quest is persistently pursued in this way,the ego, the doubter=\r\n, becomes extinct, and no more doubts will arise because the mind-free stat=\r\ne is then attained.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Now we come to the question, =E2=80=98Is the w=\r\norld real?=E2=80=99 Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching on this point is given in t=\r\nhe next seven verses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;84 The Guru, who is a sage, teaches the unreal=\r\nity of the world in accordance with his own experience, also giving reasons=\r\n supporting it. The disciple who aspires to become=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\nfree should a=\r\nccept this teaching with perfect faith and [with its help] strive for this =\r\ngoal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;85 The universe, comprising these three =E2=80=93 the soul, Go=\r\nd and the world of visible objects =E2=80=93 is superimposed by the mind on=\r\n the real Self, which is the sole reality of the supreme state. Hence all t=\r\nhis [universe] is just an outcome of ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;The mind is the creator of the universe. Ignorance is the primal=\r\n cause of the mind. Hence it is said here that this ignorance is the cause =\r\nof the universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;86 That being so, when this ignorance is ann=\r\nihilated by the light of awareness of that Self, then, along with it, the c=\r\nonsequence of it [the world] will, like the darkness that disappears before=\r\n sunlight at dawn, cease to appear.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This will become more and more=\r\n intelligible as we proceed. What is stated above are the actual facts of t=\r\nhe Guru=E2=80=99s own experience. The conclusion that follows for the disci=\r\nple is given next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;87 This universe [we see] shines in the dense dar=\r\nkness of ignorance, but does not shine in the great splendour of the light =\r\nof Self-awareness. If this universe were real, why does it not shine in the=\r\n supreme state, lit as it is by the conscious, effulgent light of the real =\r\nSelf?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An axiomatic distinction between the real and unreal, which =\r\nis implicit in vedantic metaphysics, is next enunciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;88 That whi=\r\nch survives in the experience of the real Self is the supreme state. [That]=\r\n alone is real. All else is only unreal. This is the distinction between th=\r\ne real and the unreal, revealed to us by the teachings of all the sages.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;By this test the world is shown to be unreal. The next verse elabora=\r\ntes on this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;89 Since multiplicity is experienced only in the state =\r\nof ignorance, it is declared to be unreal. On the other hand, because the u=\r\nnity of the Self is experienced on the liquidation of ignorance, that unity=\r\n is real.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It may be questioned: =E2=80=98If ignorance is total dar=\r\nkness, how can anything be experienced in this state?=E2=80=99 The explanat=\r\nion is that this ignorance is not like perfect darkness, but like a greatly=\r\n diminished light. In dim light a rope is not invisible; it is merely perce=\r\nived wrongly as a snake. In the same way, in ignorance, what is real, the S=\r\nelf, is not invisible; it is mistakenly taken to be the world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The=\r\n reality is only that which survives in the supreme state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;90 =E2=80=\r\n=98The sole reality is that peaceful Self which shines by the light of its =\r\nown nature as pure consciousness in the supreme state wherein the world is =\r\nlost.=E2=80=99 Such is the teaching of our holy Guru.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here it is s=\r\nhown that the state is one of peace because there is no duality there. This=\r\n is what we learn from all the Upanishads.This teaching is further confirme=\r\nd by the analogy of the dream world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;91 As the dream world is known to be unreal for the reason that it vanish=\r\nes upon waking, so this waking world is also proved to be unreal by its van=\r\nishing in the light of the real Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is next pointed ou=\r\nt that those who seek to discredit this teaching are those who do not arden=\r\ntly aspire to the supreme state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;92 But ignorant men, who are averse=\r\n to winning the supreme state, put forth an endless series of arguments, [t=\r\nrying to refute this teaching]. The sages clear the doubts generated by the=\r\nse arguments so that earnest aspirants may not be deluded by them.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The teaching is addressed not to all men, but only to those who aspire to =\r\nwin the supreme state, because they alone are qualified to receive it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;93 This teaching of the unreality of the world is not addressed to those=\r\n who look upon the body itself as the Self, or consider the Self to be the =\r\nowner of the body. For these people the world is real, not unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The teaching has to be adapted to the person being taught. The same teachi=\r\nng is not good for all. Here it is shown that he who believes that the Self=\r\n is not the body, but the owner of it, or the dweller therein, is for this =\r\npurpose in the same category as the one who believes the body itself to be =\r\nthe Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Why is it that the world is real to these people?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;94 The teaching =E2=80=93 that the trinity of the soul, God and the world =\r\nis unreal =E2=80=93 is indivisible. If one is convinced that one of these i=\r\ns real, the other two also will appear to be real.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That is, the te=\r\naching must either be accepted as a whole or rejected wholly. There is no o=\r\nption to split it up and accept it partially, rejecting some of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n95 To those who seek deliverance, the teaching is that all these three are =\r\nequally unreal. This teaching must [therefore] be accepted, exactly as it i=\r\ns taught, by those who are earnestly seeking to win deliverance by the exti=\r\nnction of ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For different aspirants there are different p=\r\naths prescribed. This particular teaching is addressed only to those who be=\r\nlieve that for them deliverance must come by right awareness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An ana=\r\nlogy is next given to explain the indivisibility of the teaching.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n96 One who is wise will either accept the teaching as a whole, or reject th=\r\ne whole of it. Who can make use of half of a hen for cooking, reserving the=\r\n other half for laying eggs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hen must be killed and cooked for foo=\r\nd, or the whole hen must be allowed to live for laying eggs. The same indiv=\r\nisibility is characteristic of this teaching.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Now we come to a dis=\r\ncussion of the objections of those who assert the perfect reality of the wo=\r\nrld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On what evidence do they base their belief?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;97 To begin =\r\nwith, it needs to be considered why the world is taken to be real. For the =\r\nburden of proving the reality of the world lies on him that asserts it, [no=\r\nt on those who simply deny it].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;98 Everyone who is ignorant [of th=\r\ne real Self] thinks the world is real because it is seen. This is no proof =\r\nbecause it proves too much. The same reason would prove the reality of the =\r\nmirage, the rope in the snake, etc.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Usually, the knowledge that ar=\r\nises from seeing is mixed up with imagination, or a false impression of wha=\r\nt is seen. This reason is therefore inconclusive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question then =\r\narises: =E2=80=98What does the seeing of the world prove?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;99 The fact of being seen is not conclusive proof that the world exists ex=\r\nactly as imagined [by the seer]. From the seeing it is proper to infer only=\r\n that there is a substratum in which the world appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first=\r\n verse of Ulladu Narpadu Bhagavan says: =E2=80=98Because we see the world, =\r\nit is indisputable that there exists a first cause [substratum or basic rea=\r\nlity] which has the power to appear as many.=E2=80=99 In the same verse he =\r\nproceeds to reveal, in the light of his own experience, that that substratu=\r\nm is only the real Self, on which are superimposed the four elements of the=\r\n world appearance, the pictures of names and forms, the seeing individual s=\r\noul, the screen and the light. The seeing subject and the spectacle seen fo=\r\nrm the appearance imposed on the substratum. The lighted screen is the subs=\r\ntratum. Here the analogy of the cinema show is suggested.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The pictures, in which the seer is included, come and=\r\n go, but the lighted screen exists unaffected throughout. The power by whic=\r\nh the appearance is superimposed on the substratum is known as maya.&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0All that is meant by calling the world =E2=80=98an effect of maya=E2=\r\n=80=99 is that things are not what they seem to those who have not known th=\r\ne real Self as it really is.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;100 Even scientists have proved that =\r\nthings are not exactly as they appear [to the seer], for they say that the =\r\nsolid-seeming objects are really little more than empty space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atomi=\r\nc physics now tells us that the atom is not a solid particle, but a closed =\r\nspace in which electrons are rotating around a nucleus, composed of protons=\r\n and neutrons, etc. The electrons rotate at different distances from the nu=\r\ncleus. The whole atom thus resembles a solar system. That things are not wh=\r\nat they seem is thus indisputable. On the other hand, there is no proof tha=\r\nt things are what they seem to be. There is, in fact, an antithesis between=\r\n appearance and reality. It is this that is called maya, which is the illus=\r\nion by which reality appears as the world, that spectacle which resembles a=\r\n cinema-show. Due to this illusion there is ignorance (avidya) which works =\r\nthrough the mind that wrongly identifies the body as the Self. For this rea=\r\nson the truth about the world is a profound mystery, one that transcends th=\r\ne human intellect, but it is no mystery to the sage, who alone is competent=\r\n to tell us the truth as it really is. The next verse points this out.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;101 Only the sage who knows the substratum of the world appearance, th=\r\ne reality, by being firmly established in the supreme state, is competent t=\r\no reveal the truth of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By his unawareness of that truth th=\r\ne common man, being a victim of his ignorance, cannot know the truth about =\r\nthe world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;102 When vision is foc=\r\nused on the outside, who can know the truth, whether of the real Self or of=\r\n the world? But, with the mind turned inwards, the sage knows the truth of =\r\nboth by the eye of right awareness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is with the knowledg=\r\ne of this uniqueness of the sage that the disciple has to approach him and =\r\nlisten to his teaching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-lef=\r\nt:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);=\r\nfont-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-l=\r\neft:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0=\r\n =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=\r\n=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00235429d3567cf498049f0bb521--\r\n\n"}}
