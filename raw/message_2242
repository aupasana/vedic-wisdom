Well...\n\nToday, as a direct result of Sri Acharyaji&#39;s presence =\r\nin Omaha for the last two years, Omaha finally has a large and thriving Dha=\r\nrma community for the very first time in this area&#39;s history, and Sri Achar=\r\nyaji&#39;s prediction about the future of Dharma in Omaha is now on the verge o=\r\nf becoming a concrete reality!\n\nBy God&#39;s grace, and under the qualified gui=\r\ndance of Sri Acharyaji, we will be establishing a large teaching center and=\r\n ashram in the Omaha area by this Fall that will serve as a one of a kind, =\r\nglobally renowned resource facility for the dedicated study and practice of=\r\n pure and authentic Sanatana Dharma.\n\nDesigned to serve both the local Hind=\r\nu community, as well as be a preferred destination for Dharma students from=\r\n throughout the world, all of Sri Acharyji&#39;s classes, satsangs, Hindu Youth=\r\n Celebration events, and seminars will be shifted from the Hindu Temple of =\r\nOmaha to our new ashram. In addition, the center will host seminars, talks,=\r\n and workshops by many of the world&#39;s leading Dharma teachers; house one of=\r\n the nation&#39;s best Sanatana Dharma libraries; as well as operate a natural =\r\nhealth facility and school offering such traditional Hindu healing modaliti=\r\nes as Ayurveda and Yoga.\n\nThe initial first-phase goal is to purchase a hom=\r\ne in the Midtown area of Omaha. We are currently seeking, at the minimum, a=\r\n 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom building, with a large gathering space on the ground=\r\n floor. Our capital budget for the purchase and remodeling of the building =\r\nis $200,000, with the immediate goal of raising $50,000 by November 25, 200=\r\n9. Please see the Center for Dharma Studies Business Plan for more details.=\r\n http://dharmacentral.com/ashram.php\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nOur new Dharma cent=\r\ner/ashram can only become a reality with your practical commitment to provi=\r\nding the donations necessary for the initial purchase and monthly upkeep of=\r\n the ashram.
