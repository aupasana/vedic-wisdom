What this namboodiri did i=\r\ns the correct way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire a=\r\nnd worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and stre=\r\namline it, depending on how strong your identification is (it will get stro=\r\nnger with practice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offering=\r\ns in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire=\r\n for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose =\r\nkarmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and childre=\r\nn. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are =\r\nready and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a strong in=\r\ndividualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that=\r\n ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on mor=\r\ne karmas and face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leav=\r\nes, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and=\r\n let it grow very\n&gt;  big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more peopl=\r\ne. So, until you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and fre=\r\ne yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt; \n&gt; But=\r\n some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to=\r\n start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it et=\r\nc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire do=\r\nes such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who fol=\r\nlow this approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a stron=\r\ng identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for th=\r\nem and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing eve=\r\nryone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficie=\r\nnt at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best approach is: You start yo=\r\nur own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your min=\r\nd, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the s=\r\nubtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Wit=\r\nhout your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various =\r\nvaasanas.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelak=\r\nam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worry a=\r\nbout these things and do what you are used to or what you are more attracte=\r\nd to.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for most =\r\npeople. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher significanc=\r\ne than just tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a specific body part vi=\r\nbrating with a specific sound is possible only after one makes sufficient p=\r\nrogress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discu=\r\nssing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this will not bl=\r\nock you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) They should be shown in the video. If you cannot get them=\r\n, please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra.

Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday.
