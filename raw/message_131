=96 and have joyously convert=\r\ned to Sanatana Dharma =96 the \nEternal Natural Way.  \n\nThe artificial natio=\r\nnal construct of &quot;Pakistan&quot; will have ceased to \nexist, torn apart by its o=\r\nwn internal political and cultural \ncontradictions.  \n\nThere will be over 1=\r\n000 Hindu temples across the length and breadth \nof China, with millions of=\r\n enthusiastic native Chinese filling these \ntemples to overflowing.  \n\nWe w=\r\nill witness multiple Dharma Nations emerge onto the world scene \nas powerfu=\r\nl and prosperous nations that will serve as examples to the \nrest of the wo=\r\nrld of what nations look like when governments truly \nreflect the sole inte=\r\nrests of their people.  \n\nIndia will not be the first of these Dharma Natio=\r\nns.\n\n\nThis will all have occurred by the year 2058.  \n\n\nOm Hari Om\n\n\n\n"}}
