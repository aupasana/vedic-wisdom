You invoke \nVaruna in a kalasha, do 16 upachara pooja, read Pavamaana (purifying) \nsooktam (also known as Punyaaha vaachanam), do pooja to dikpaalakas etc. \nSome people do Jayaadi homam as a part of uttaraangam (offerings to various \nGandharvas and Apsaras representing various aspects of ourselves, with \nrespective Veda mantras). For vasordhara, some read the entire Chamakam \ninstead of just the 3rd anuvaakam. And so on. I may publish a long manual \nfor Ganapathi homam sometime, if Mother is willing.\n\n(2) You can do swaha in Chamakam after each anuvaakam. Some people offer \njust Namakam in pradhaana homam and read Chamakam for vasordhara. Namakam \nand Chamakam are a very powerful Vedic prayer.\n\n*        *        *\n\nRegarding your experiences, my thought is that your children are special \nwith good spiritual potential. Any sadhana of an ugra devata, homam or \nmeditation, can throw up some tests as one starts to make progress. As I \nexplained earlier, this is like some mess spilling onto the floor as an \nagressive person tries to take out rotten fruits from a fruit basket and \nthrows them into garbage can, so that some good fruits stuck under can be \nextracted. A gentle deity will be slow and careful and the spillover will be \nminimal. Also, the speed at which good fruits are extracted will also be \nslow. An ugra devata will be fast and agressive and there may be some \nspillover. But the good fruits are extracted fast that way. With a gentle \ndeity such as Ganesha or Vishnu or Lakshmi, some spillover is possible, but \nit will be small. Most importantly, one should note that the rotten fruit \nthat spilled over was put in that basket by oneself (i.e. one&#39;s own karma) \nand, for every little spillover, a lot more would&#39;ve been successfully \nthrown into garbage can (i.e. bad karmas burnt up in sadhana so that they do \nnot have to be experienced).\n\nThe fruits of one&#39;s sadhana will also be enjoyed by the people to whom one \nis closely attached and with whom one&#39;s karmas are strongly intertwined. \nHowever, any negative results due to spillover of karmas will usually be \ntaken by the person oneself. However, if there are gentle and elevated souls \naround one, they *may* take it on themselves. This is like a gentle and nice \nperson around you hurrying to clean up some rotten fruit spilled over on the \nfloor near you.\n\nFirst of all, these are all signs that Ganesha is not looking at just giving \nmaterial benefits to you, as he does to most people, but considering you \nworthy of spiritual progress and testing you. Ganesha can give material and \nspiritual progress. Secondly, it shows that your children have some \npotential. Teach them some religious stuff from a young age.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;homamstudent&quot; &lt;vedichoroscope@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 23, 2009 12:17 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam Questions\n\n\n&gt; Pranaam Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been following your Mahaganapati Homam for a few weeks now and\n&gt; have been getting good results and for that I am thankful to you and\n&gt; Manishji who is the inspiration behind this.  When I started this\n&gt; initially I had big doubts since on the first day I performed the Homam\n&gt; my elder son fell down and broke his tooth and had bleeding (I was\n&gt; reading the story of Ganesha losing his tooth to Parashurama&#39;s axe the\n&gt; same day) and the next time I did the Homam my younger son caught his\n&gt; foot in the temple door we were visiting on the same day (Ganesha\n&gt; guarding the door?) and got hurt.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was expecting some negative experiences to come my way when I started\n&gt; the Homams as part of some karmic cleansing but I was expecting them to\n&gt; come my way and not the way of family members so was a bit surprised.  I\n&gt; was wondering if you have any thoughts on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; My questions on Homam are the following\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.  Have you published a regular or long procedure for Mahaganapati\n&gt; Homam?  At some point I would like to try a longer version if that is\n&gt; available.  Is the difference only between the 5 types and the 16 types\n&gt; of offering or there is more to it such as detailed puja of digpalas and\n&gt; grahas etc?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  I recite Sri Rudram/Chamakam path for several years now and would\n&gt; like to do that via Homam.  Can you provide some guidance as to how to\n&gt; do this?  i.e. when to say swaha?  I think it is fairly logical to do\n&gt; that in Rudram but Chamakam is not so clear and swaha seems to come at\n&gt; the end of each anuvaaka only.  Or perhaps Chamakam is only to be\n&gt; recited and not offered to Agni\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; Veenu\n\n\n"}}
