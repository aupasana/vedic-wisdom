Intention/de=\r\nsire is a powerful thing. It controls our mind and our actions. Because of =\r\nits power and control over the mind, it is compared to a king.\n&gt; \n&gt; Samaadh=\r\ni means focus or concentration. Businessman named Samaadhi is a metaphor fo=\r\nr one&#39;s focus and concentration. While desires typically excite mind into a=\r\nn active mode, focus (on anything) typically tricks the mind and soothes it=\r\n. That is why it is compared to a vaisya (a businessman), who knows what he=\r\n wants and mesmerizes people into giving it to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Medhas means intel=\r\nligence. Rishi named Medhas is a metaphor for intelligence. While one&#39;s des=\r\nires and focus may be deluded and run after material things, one&#39;s intellig=\r\nence is firmly established in god and clear about what is what. No confusio=\r\nn. That is why intelligence is compared to a rishi!\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If one desires a luxury car, wife&#39;s happiness, son&#39;s professional succe=\r\nss and other material things like that, one&#39;s intelligence cannot really ed=\r\nucate and direct the desire within one towards finding Self. Similarly, if =\r\none&#39;s concentration is directed at work and various mundane tasks, intellig=\r\nence cannot really educate and direct one&#39;s concentration towards finding S=\r\nelf.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, when king Suratha and businessman Samadhi were pre-occ=\r\nupied with their families, their kingdom, wealth etc, rishi Medhas could no=\r\nt really direct them towards the divine Mother.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once the king and the =\r\nbusinessman were forced to turn away from their families etc, they landed u=\r\np at the ashram of rishi Medhas and he could educate them on how to find th=\r\ne divine Mother.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, when one&#39;s desire and concentration are tu=\r\nrned away from the regular things they are usually centred around (sense ob=\r\njects and material things), then intelligence can direct one&#39;s desire and c=\r\noncentration towards finding the Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, =\r\ndesire and concentration turning away from material things and approaching =\r\nintelligence for guidance is the *beginning* of the thirteen chapters of Ch=\r\nandipath. The rest is how intelligence instructs them on finding Self. All =\r\nthe stories are a metaphorical representation of various phases and challen=\r\nges encountered as one strives to find Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; The l=\r\nast (13th) chapter says that the king and the businessman worshipped the di=\r\nvine Mother after the instruction from the rishi and She appeared before th=\r\nem. The divine Mother gave them boons.\n&gt; \n&gt; King got a boon that he will ge=\r\nt back his kingdom and be born as the son of Sun named Saavarni. Businessma=\r\nn got a boon that he will get absolute knowledge and liberation. Now let us=\r\n understand what that means.\n&gt; \n&gt; When one&#39;s desire and focus are directed =\r\nto Self-realization, one finally realizes Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; One&#39;s power of concent=\r\nration always becomes one with the object of concentration when it succeeds=\r\n. When one&#39;s power of concentration is not directed at a mundane object/tas=\r\nk but not imperishable Self, one&#39;s concentration merges with the imperishab=\r\nle Self. That is why the businessman named Samadhi got absolute knowledge a=\r\nnd liberation.\n&gt; \n&gt; A Self-realized person becomes a jeevanmukta (liberated=\r\n while living) and his power of concentration is directed at god even as he=\r\n pursues many things. He may &quot;want&quot; to build a temple or spread dharma or d=\r\nestroy a kingdom or establish a new kingdom or whatever, but, despite his a=\r\npparent activities, focus of his mind is on Self. One is an instrument of i=\r\nnfinite divine Will and engages in various actions non-volitionally. The in=\r\ntentions/desires of such a person are not his, but those of Nature. When he=\r\n gets an intention to do something, he non-volitionally engages in an actio=\r\nn, with a full and deep understanding that the objects he is interacting wi=\r\nth during that action are just projections of Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the meanin=\r\ng of king Suratha being reborn as the son of Sun. The intentions/desires wi=\r\nthin one are now coming from Nature/Self and not from one&#39;s own conditionin=\r\ng (which is non-existent now). That is the meaning of Suratha being reborn =\r\nas the son (coming from) of Sun (Self).\n&gt; \n&gt; Saavarni is the name of the re=\r\nborn king. Some people may translate &quot;saavarni&quot; to mean &quot;one having the sam=\r\ne color&quot;, but my translation is &quot;the transparent one&quot;. The desires/intentio=\r\nns behind the actions of a jeevanmukta are transparent, i.e. free from any =\r\nconditioning or individual agenda. Such a person may engage in many kinds o=\r\nf actions, but the power of concentration of such a person never wavers fro=\r\nm Self!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the ending of the story metaphorically represents what h=\r\nappens to the desires/intentions and the power of concentration/focus withi=\r\nn one, after they have been directed at finding Self, one finds Self and be=\r\ncomes liberated while living.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; This is very high ph=\r\nilosophy.
