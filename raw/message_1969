The \nbest you can do is to ensure that the eggs you are laying now are good.\n\nThe key is to realize that the chickens that come to roost are NOT laying \nthe eggs. YOU are.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Also, what is the extent of fate/free will in anybody&#39;s life?\n\nEvery conscious action of yours at every instant is done by your individual \nwill. It is NOT forced by your fate. Fate does not force ANY actions. All \nactions are performed by YOU now.\n\nBut the problem is that the possibilities in front of you are sometimes \nbadly limited by the fate.\n\nBut always people have more options before them than they think there are. \nBecause fate *inclines* them to look at some options and ignore some others, \nthey consider fewer options than they actually have.\n\nFate creates circumstances under which one&#39;s individual will performs \nactions.\n\nThe first step for spiritual progress is to realize that YOU are responsible \nfor the actions of your individual will. The second step is to not cling on \nto your actions and let things go as soon as the action is over \n(&quot;krishnaarpanamastu&quot;), i.e. do the action with attachment, but develop \ndetachment as soon as the action is over and move on to the next action. \nOften people spend a lot of mental energy on an action that is already done, \nwondering whether it will give a specific result or not, whether a specific \nresult that came is because of it or not, why people are reacting in a \nparticular way etc etc. The mental energy spent on an action *after* the \naction is completely performed is often much more than the mental energy \nspent on an action while it is performed. All that shapes fate later. As it \nis very difficult to perform actions with detachment as Krishna teaches, I \nsuggest performing actions with attachment, but let them go and detach \nyourself *after* they are done and not spend any more mental energy \nanalyzing or speculating on .\n\nThe final step is to develop detachment even as you are performing actions. \nThere is a part of you that is permanent and indestructible. It is watching \nall actions being performed. Attach your self-awareness to that part of you. \nThen your body may be engaged in several actions, but *you* are merely an \nobserver. But then, this is not easy. But what I said above is easy. In \nfact, we do say &quot;Krishnaarpanamastu&quot; (may it be offered to Krishna) at the \nend of every ritual. We should do that with all actions.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &lt;kshroum@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 10, 2009 4:05 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Horoscope, free will and high profile charts\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji,\n&gt;  I have read the great article about the free-will/fate and have some \n&gt; understanding of why/how current free-will may/may not counter-act result \n&gt; of &#39;past free-will&#39;/&#39;current-fate&#39;.\n&gt;  But, this has got me into egg-chicken problem. Can you please kindly \n&gt; relate free-will/fate at grandeur level? If we go to the root cause of all \n&gt; the causes..When the current universe came into existance at the moment of \n&gt; big-bang (or maybe universe already existed, it just changed its form at \n&gt; that moment so that it became perceptable to us mortal) , was it resulting \n&gt; from free-will of its own fate from possibly last grand resolution of the \n&gt; universe?\n&gt; Whos free-will or fate was it? Is it cumulative free-will(resolve) of all \n&gt; souls that came into existence then or the cumulative fate of all the soul \n&gt; from past universe? how did the first karma/action or first reaction was \n&gt; concieved by a soul without an external stimulus?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, what is the extent of fate/free will in anybody&#39;s life? Is taking \n&gt; each breath is a result of free will or fate? We doing yagna/homam is it \n&gt; free-will excercised or was it fated?\n&gt; How can somebody differentiate between any moment being parcel from fate \n&gt; or a new act? of it has to be simultaneous all the time?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for all your sincere thoughts!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n\n\n"}}
