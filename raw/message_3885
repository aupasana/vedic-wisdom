W=\r\nhat will be our condition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.\n\n***\nYou=\r\n have passionately raised some questions in defense and i find nothing wron=\r\ng in it but One thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrass=\r\nment such episodes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be a=\r\nnything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a =\r\ngreat many followers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preac=\r\nhes the same and does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge an=\r\nd talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is =\r\na gross.\nI whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extr=\r\nemely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his stru=\r\nggles on sexual matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of s=\r\nuch a stature in society. He really was a Saadhu.\n\nThere is a big differenc=\r\ne between fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sr=\r\ni Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big emb=\r\narrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Maste=\r\nr, in front of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is=\r\n a bigger blow to faiths of general public.\n\nI am not specific on Satyanand=\r\na here because i do not know if it is really true.\n\nIf the footage is right=\r\n, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to st=\r\neer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so t=\r\nhat corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.\n\n&gt; Furthe=\r\nr, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and \n\nYo=\r\nu have spoken the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then s=\r\nay even 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a ver=\r\ny elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/p=\r\nains of sexual desires.\n\nFinally, i would say that its high time for Big na=\r\nmes and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of  Vi=\r\nmalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical and =\r\nmental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya.)=\r\n\n\nIt reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaa=\r\nchi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal   \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I to=\r\no believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There ar=\r\ne some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. =\r\nTehelka, which did the sting operation,=C2=A0is a VERY questionable organiz=\r\nation.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was=\r\n not practising say some sexual ritual?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 3) What exactly is the b=\r\nig fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible fo=\r\nr even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till d=\r\neath. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would=\r\n=C2=A0probably=C2=A0not be able to remain so when born in thid age=C2=A0is =\r\na simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different fr=\r\nom other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Fur=\r\nther, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and co=\r\nmplex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is =\r\none going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudi=\r\nshness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; All said=\r\n and done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints wh=\r\no lived - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordia=\r\nnry sadhus and saints?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that S=\r\nwami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to co=\r\nme, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as=\r\n his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best poss=\r\nible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps do=\r\ning homas for some years. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; Take away =\r\nthe me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; \n&gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give =\r\nthe benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions=\r\n as someone said.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine,=\r\n it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.
