Why are the *4th*, 7th and=\r\n 8th avataras most popular if there is a nice &quot;evolutionary&quot; sequence among=\r\n the 9???\n=A0\nThere is a very simple explanation, if one throws away the no=\r\ntion of &quot;evolutionary&quot; sequence. These are *poornavataras*, completely divi=\r\nne and devoid of jeevatmamsa, as per Parasara. In contrast, the 5th and 6th=\r\n avataras did have some jeevatmamsa in them.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB=\r\n.

Yet, he is no=\r\nt in the list of 9/10 Avataras.&gt;&gt;\n=A0\nFirst of all, dasavataras are not a &quot;=\r\ntop 10&quot; short-list of SB&#39;s list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Bein=\r\ng (&quot;Purusha&quot; as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who=\r\n is the &quot;sustaining principle&quot; of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brah=\r\nma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive pr=\r\ninciples of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavata=\r\nras. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is =\r\nsimply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Ju=\r\nst in terms of &quot;popularity&quot;, he is actually more popular than some of the d=\r\nasavataras.\n=A0\nSecondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms like &quot;l=\r\ness&quot; or more in &quot;spirituality&quot;, try to *understand* avataras from the point=\r\n of view of what functionality and role they play in the functioning of col=\r\nlective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them and the=\r\nir place in cosmos.

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free t=\r\no disagree :)\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially used=A0=\r\nterm=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyond what any=\r\n normal human being can achieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava sch=\r\nools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=A0on earth. It =\r\nis difficult to miss the phonetic=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and =\r\nBhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation=\r\n of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanuj=\r\nacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=A0as well as=\r\n the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translatio=\r\nn of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuances on the=A0relation betw=\r\neen jiva, paramatma, moksha=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of Go=\r\nd on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the e=\r\narliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a comple=\r\nte Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and too=\r\nk a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, =\r\nand the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=A0as merely=A0the aura of =\r\nKrshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looke=\r\nd at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Whatever the case maybe, each school had its own set of established sa=\r\nints and scholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpreta=\r\ntion, which is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=A0various condit=\r\nionings.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;We=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an =\r\nAvatar appears on the earth,=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after =\r\nthe Avatara, remain=A0overawed by the=A0character of the last Avatara=A0bec=\r\nause invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the l=\r\nife of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=A0way beyond=A0imagina=\r\ntion for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avatara c=\r\nomes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of wh=\r\nich we have very little written record, the world at large remained entirel=\r\ny overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatar=\r\na. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a s=\r\net of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who =\r\nexplain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the general masse=\r\ns - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as the =\r\ncrest jewel=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0 *=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I believe in the =\r\nevolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why =\r\nthese set of Avatara, from the whole list of possible=A0Avataras, have capt=\r\nured the popular imagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB=\r\n. His spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is no=\r\nt in the list of 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt;=A0\n&gt;The=A0original Nath Yogis used to co=\r\nnsider=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also ca=\r\nme from them, which was basically exploring=A0cronologically all these nine=\r\n chakras one after the other by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;There=\r\n are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=A0represent the =\r\nessential nature of each chakra. All these make me more sanguine that there=\r\n must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be t=\r\nhe Ninth Avatara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Buddha, as you rightly pointed out,=A0has a tremend=\r\nous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why not=\r\n Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=A0his philosophy as it comes down to us f=\r\nrom his followers, but it cannot be denied that=A0Adi Shankara was=A0arguab=\r\nle one of the sharpest and most logical of spiritual philosphers. His intel=\r\nlectual and logical mind=A0is beyond doubt.=A0Just that Shankara=A0never cl=\r\naimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did=A0Siddhartha. Only that the lat=\r\ner came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years=\r\n.=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is no less than that of the=A0=\r\nBuddha. What mainstream=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it no=\r\nt been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was t=\r\nruly=A0the awaited=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been ab=\r\nle to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose i=\r\nts grip on India. Buddhism\n barely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;All t=\r\nhis taken together, make me more and more convinced that there are 9 evolut=\r\nionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0 *=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;A littl=\r\ne bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-ser=\r\nvice. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring,=\r\n educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the oce=\r\nan. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used=\r\n his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sa=\r\nt in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army sa=\r\nfe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocate=\r\nd, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=A0THEN=A0Rama took u=\r\np weapons to get the job done.=A0A powerful warrior,=A0who knows=A0very wel=\r\nl how=A0powerful he=A0himself is, not letting that sense of power pervert h=\r\nis mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-contr=\r\nol is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever=\r\n so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or influence in\n this worl=\r\nd in any sphere.=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the e=\r\nnd of the war at least. He was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa,=\r\n conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Recently, a frie=\r\nnd of mine told me that he has learnt all his life that one must listen to =\r\nKrshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I =\r\ndisagree with this vehemently. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life=A0with an =\r\nobjective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetr=\r\na, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshn=\r\na the Guru adviced in the Gita,=A0Krshna the=A0Divine Worker=A0himself foll=\r\nowed it all through his life at every instance. It is his=A0perfect detachm=\r\nent under all circumstances of life, from childhood=A0to his death,=A0that =\r\nmakes me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do someth=\r\ning like this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate=\r\n from everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile=\r\n. He had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had =\r\nhis wife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had ze=\r\nro=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=A0After liberating his parents from=\r\n Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he =\r\nforced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gre=\r\nat war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Ra=\r\nma all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=A0Bala=\r\nrama in his next incarnation=A0he could=A0hardly understand Krshna. There a=\r\nre so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with =\r\nall these kings, and=A0that they should=A0return to their village in Vrndav=\r\nana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand every=\r\nthing. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect det=\r\nachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong ac=\r\ncusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even cou=\r\nnting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n worship Krshna, be=\r\ncause I have not yet met or heard of read of=A0a single sadhaka or saint or=\r\n ordinary man or mahatma=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected detachm=\r\nent through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or actively =\r\nperforming a larger dharma.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I started appreciating Swami Vivekanada m=\r\nore after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was the last known=\r\n saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stoplight of fa=\r\nme and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other bitter en=\r\nemies accusing him of=A0being a heretic=A0right upto the=A0very end of his =\r\nbrief life,=A0and yet none of that affected him to any great degree. He fac=\r\ned terrific racism in the America, yet not a single speech of his reflects =\r\nthe slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity. That is such a fan=\r\ntastic achievement, IMHO.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I agree with you, Narasimha, for most of us=\r\n it is better to=A0try to=A0mould ones life=A0with the same kind of supreme=\r\n selflessness that Rama showed all along.=A0Not just worship Rama=A0but mor=\r\ne importantly study=A0his life and imbibe,=A0to whatever degree possible, t=\r\nhe quality he represented.=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reali=\r\nty - Shiva - will fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some futu=\r\nre life, in some later birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna sho=\r\nwed, unattached and unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up. And th=\r\nen the=A0Universal=A0Chit-Shakti (Adya Shakti)=A0will flood such an individ=\r\nual with oppulence unimaginable, of this world and also of=A0what lies in o=\r\nther worlds, like Krshna&#39;s six oppulences -=A0Infinite wealth, infinite bea=\r\nuty, infinite power/knowledge, infinite fame, and infinite detachment from =\r\nall the other five. \n&gt;=A0\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Enjoyed this discussion. :)\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Jai Jai=\r\n=A0Rama Krshna Hari!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApann=\r\nam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24=\r\n]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

He too said there are i=\r\nnnumerable avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatmamsas =\r\n(supreme/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative being po=\r\nrtions) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras of Vis=\r\nhnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras also desc=\r\nended on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and jivat=\r\nmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;=\r\nIn fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and some j=\r\nivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of us.=\r\n\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;When one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to respective gra=\r\nhas and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the\n &#39;end&#39;, even =\r\nthe jivatmamsas return to respective grahas.

Though some people associate him with lagna, that makes no s=\r\nense to me either. That is inconsistent with the overall framework laid by =\r\nParasara (i.e. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmams=\r\nas from *grahas*).\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Kalki will probably come with paramatmamsas of bot=\r\nh Sun and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and Moon - sou=\r\nl and mind) coming together finally!!

If people at the beginning of Satya yuga are established in Self always =\r\nand the only issue is that a small attachment may develop now and then, dis=\r\nturbing that state of being established in Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), t=\r\nhen the aspect of consciousness that is relevant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; =\r\n(Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to being =\r\nestablished in Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;As=\r\n collective consciousness became denser, being established in Self became l=\r\ness natural and more effort was needed. So the &quot;spirit of patience, persist=\r\nence and\n hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became relevant and an avatara corresponding =\r\nto Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rationa=\r\nl minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being establishe=\r\nd in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So t=\r\nhe &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mercury) became relevant. An avatara correspo=\r\nnding to Mercury occurred and tried to explain being established in Self as=\r\n a comprehensible notion, so that rational minds of that age would accept i=\r\nt to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of c=\r\nollective consciousness. Of course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a differen=\r\nt state from the collective consciousness of that time, the current avatara=\r\n may not be relevant to one.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I am\n awestruc=\r\nk by Krishna and worship him, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able=\r\n to emulate oneday.

Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Su=\r\npreme explains the various vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has t=\r\nranscended every limitation of conception. Hence, the One says, among those=\r\n who weild weapons, it is Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara=\r\n&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, the=\r\nn your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary=\r\n&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It d=\r\noes not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 2=\r\n2 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any use. For these nine gr=\r\nahas, individually or in combination, will represent all Avataras, or for t=\r\nhat matter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we take 1=\r\n0 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna=\r\n? But=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possibl=\r\ne that until an Avatara actually descends on the earth, his energy and his =\r\nforce cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he does appear, it reconf=\r\nigures things completely? We can only know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars from the point of graha=\r\ns/jyotish at all. For that matter, some traditions consider Balarama to be =\r\nan Avatara rather than Buddha.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;The concept of Avatara and Vib=\r\nhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly different. Avatara is a s=\r\npecial descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on this world=A0during time=\r\ns of severe crisis to=A0cause a drastic and fundamental=A0transition. A Vib=\r\nhuti is a limited force of God which can appear to help out, directly or in=\r\ndirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual.

More importantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfect=\r\nion occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;First, regarding Kri=\r\nshna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama i=\r\ns not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Ra=\r\nma, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expr=\r\nession) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though par=\r\namatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Secondly, after describing the av=\r\nataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that all ri=\r\nshis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under =\r\nTHAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, =\r\nwhile Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *a=\r\nlone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say tha=\r\nt all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, Parar=\r\nsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nThird, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if=\r\n an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.2=\r\n8, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formle=\r\nss (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufa=\r\nctured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares fo=\r\nrms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds=\r\n and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So=\r\n, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth bei=\r\nng &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion ba=\r\nsed on their fancies and conditioning..\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of p=\r\naramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The =\r\nlatter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth=\r\n. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely av=\r\nataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama an=\r\nd Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;They are entirel=\r\ny divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;e=\r\nntire\n divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can co=\r\nntain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the=\r\n divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha wa=\r\ns great spiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the =\r\nscheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, =\r\nis a static realization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;First, he IS mention=\r\ned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; =\r\nin your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wro=\r\nng and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Sec=\r\nondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logi=\r\ncal mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n a=\r\nnd its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected sp=\r\nirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality compl=\r\netely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Inco=\r\nmprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doin=\r\ng. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Ka=\r\nli yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this wo=\r\nrld in this age.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possibl=\r\ne corruption, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying=\r\n on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only ta=\r\nking some SB verses and ignoring some as\n I\n showed!.)\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;The bottomli=\r\nne as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazing=\r\nly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g=\r\n. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persisten=\r\nce, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara=\r\n DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all=\r\n, esoterically is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures a=\r\nnd notions in them.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and dra=\r\nw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one=\r\n and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;s=\r\nupreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone =\r\nmay think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior\n to Tara and like Kali more.=\r\n But, some learned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and =\r\nsome scriptures even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, =\r\nthe difference between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly compre=\r\nhend. People seeing some significant difference between them are, I am afra=\r\nid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna a=\r\nnd Rama. Both were=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by=\r\n Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not really that d=\r\nifferent. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different, though th=\r\ne specifics of their stories may be different.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;One last word though=\r\n. If someone truly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships K=\r\nrishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments ar=\r\ne more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundarie=\r\ns of understanding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in th=\r\ne short run. In the end, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own c=\r\nycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before o=\r\nne starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality.

Let me write d=\r\nown as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Pu=\r\nrana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha=\r\n Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Na=\r\nra-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Pur=\r\nana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10=\r\nth Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas o=\r\nf the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of the=\r\nse various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been a=\r\nccorded special mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual lit=\r\nerature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the P=\r\nuranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence h=\r\nad curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in=\r\n full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scripture=\r\ns of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have =\r\na fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, P=\r\narashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable con=\r\nnection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution o=\r\nf life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to=\r\n the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who imme=\r\ndiately takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to=\r\n the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Satt=\r\nwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indic=\r\nates that spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a =\r\nprogressive realization of the various manifestation and potentials that li=\r\ne inherent in the consciousness and its development through various life-fo=\r\nrms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Na=\r\nture&#39;s grand design for life on earth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc contex=\r\nt, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not =\r\nmy contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain =\r\nto a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmolo=\r\ngy in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. A=\r\nnd each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and=\r\n can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=A05. Of t=\r\nhese, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a s=\r\ntage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate=\r\n of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most sa=\r\ntwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform=\r\n the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive f=\r\norce for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, t=\r\nhere can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in n=\r\nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmi=\r\nki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest.=\r\n He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was d=\r\nispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. =\r\nAt the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate ma=\r\nnner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n was the Dharma to do=\r\n so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age w=\r\nhen he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow hu=\r\nmbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they ar=\r\ne, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferenc=\r\nes to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which cul=\r\nminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate lea=\r\nder, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overtu=\r\nrn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krsh=\r\nna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking =\r\nhis=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=\r\nachment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =\r\nthat mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=\r\n Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,\n his village-folks who so lo=\r\nved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the =\r\nshelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into =\r\nan unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then =\r\nhe understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back o=\r\nnce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when=\r\n the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged=\r\n. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krs=\r\nhna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to e=\r\nveryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala =\r\nabused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling=\r\n and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shis=\r\nhupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly ac=\r\ncused Krshna of being a revolutionist\n and charlatan, Krshna did not kill h=\r\nim. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician,=\r\n wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of =\r\nkings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was b=\r\nack into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one i=\r\nnstance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivoc=\r\nation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others sa=\r\ny or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had =\r\nthe perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. Tha=\r\nt is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yo=\r\ngi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the actio=\r\nn nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the batt=\r\nle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart J=\r\narashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getti=\r\nng Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew e=\r\nxactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destructio=\r\nn of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational think=\r\ning. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Un=\r\niversal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama =\r\nAvatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut=\r\n Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different =\r\npicture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama=\r\n after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes=\r\n the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramay=\r\nana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is th=\r\ne embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great character=\r\nistics of satwa, chief\n of which is self-control, as well as the occasional=\r\n sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until R=\r\navana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint,=\r\n but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gun=\r\natita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, d=\r\nanava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of neg=\r\native emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations=\r\n. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him f=\r\nit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advoc=\r\nated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of=\r\n the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama o=\r\nr Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this wor=\r\nld and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stag=\r\nes of\n evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the r=\r\neason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They=\r\n are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spir=\r\nitual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical man=\r\nner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consid=\r\ner Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must =\r\nbe both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That=\r\n is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the w=\r\norld as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization=\r\n. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. T=\r\nhese are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 =\r\ntoo subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief =\r\nthat each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full\n po=\r\nwer and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that w=\r\nhich can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and exp=\r\nress itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a refere=\r\nnce point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the pa=\r\nrable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet=\r\n to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent whic=\r\nh Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel fr=\r\nee to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption =\r\nof understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the=\r\n Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vim=\r\nalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one.=\r\n There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a N=\r\nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete\n purity and m=\r\night and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity t=\r\nhe last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill th=\r\ne purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his=\r\n adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need t=\r\nhat. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one =\r\ncapable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our=\r\n age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok=\r\n not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is =\r\nwhat is closer to truth. -Regards =A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApa=\r\nnnam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:=\r\n24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna =\r\nis the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddh=\r\na after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spirituali=\r\nty that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;. =A0 I want t=\r\no emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progr=\r\nession of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfec=\r\nted form. =A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For examp=\r\nle, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =A0 W=\r\ne also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=\r\n Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=\r\n spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=\r\niscipline,\n spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respecti=\r\nvely). =A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of=\r\n Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect o=\r\nperates. =A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates.=\r\n Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vam=\r\nana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. L=\r\nord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative=\r\n operates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Now, let=\r\n us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learnin=\r\ng spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - =\r\nall these are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self=\r\n manifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays=\r\n different roles. There is no comparison between them. =A0 We MAY focus on =\r\none aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfect other aspects through =\r\nit. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these d=\r\nifferent aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance wor=\r\nking together in the Cosmos. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 * =A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story=\r\n that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualitie=\r\ns of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one w=\r\nho is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonst=\r\nrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste an=\r\nd subjective preference. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n* =A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as=\r\n a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It =\r\nis the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =A0 Once mind =\r\nfancies a separate existence with some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the =\r\nindividualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dh=\r\narma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized =\r\nconsciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, d=\r\niscipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes=\r\n/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s =\r\nagendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It d=\r\noes all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas n=\r\nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized co=\r\nnsciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting t=\r\nhe fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharm=\r\na and does it impassionately. =A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps no=\r\nt to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play=\r\n, may not seem interesting enough\n to some. =A0 On the other hand, mind has=\r\n likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, gett=\r\ning things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individ=\r\nualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the i=\r\nndividualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionat=\r\nely. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agenda=\r\ns and passion and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, min=\r\nd is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life a=\r\nppeals more to one who may be excited by this description! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obviously awe-ins=\r\npiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective. =A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstr=\r\nates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasis=\r\nhtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped =\r\nVishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given\n kingdom. At the last moment=\r\n, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and hi=\r\ns step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his fathe=\r\nr, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself =\r\nsupported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Th=\r\nough he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the =\r\ngolden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insist=\r\ned. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the ba=\r\nttle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshma=\r\nna for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complain=\r\nts and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did =\r\nso without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana =\r\nwas dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were =\r\ngoing to disappear with Ravana! =A0 Rama\n is a perfect example of a liberat=\r\ned man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharm=\r\na arising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically =\r\nwhat soul does! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 As =\r\nanother example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demons=\r\ntration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =A0 He was born as a learned=\r\n pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king=\r\n with many great qualities. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and =\r\nunassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities =\r\n(e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that =\r\npride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then dem=\r\nonic qualities are completely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories=\r\n can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of\n our=\r\n consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =A0 Let us n=\r\not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, i=\r\nf you are more attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara mo=\r\nre and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.=\r\n =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By the way, happy =\r\nHanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools=\r\n of thought). =A0 Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality=\r\n Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org -------- \n&gt;\r\n--61789334-444787131-1367930557=:4558\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2035484844&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;I believe =\r\nin the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reas=\r\non why these set of Avatara, from the whole list of possible Avataras, have=\r\n captured the popular imagination.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If capturing the po=\r\npular imagination is the criterion, then Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are th=\r\ne most popular ones among the 9. Why are the *4th*, 7th and 8th avataras mo=\r\nst popular if there is a nice &quot;evolutionary&quot; sequence among the 9???&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;There is a very simple explanation, if one throws away the notion of=\r\n &quot;evolutionary&quot; sequence. These are *poornavataras*, completely divine and =\r\ndevoid of jeevatmamsa, as per Parasara. In contrast, the 5th and 6th\n avata=\r\nras did have some jeevatmamsa in them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spiritualit=\r\ny is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of =\r\n9/10 Avataras.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First of all, dasavataras are not a &quot;to=\r\np 10&quot; short-list of SB&#39;s list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Being =\r\n(&quot;Purusha&quot; as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who i=\r\ns the &quot;sustaining principle&quot; of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma=\r\n, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive prin=\r\nciples of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavatara=\r\ns. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is si=\r\nmply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Just=\r\n in terms of &quot;popularity&quot;, he is actually more popular than\n some of the da=\r\nsavataras.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms=\r\n like &quot;less&quot; or more in &quot;spirituality&quot;, try to *understand* avataras from t=\r\nhe point of view of what functionality and role they play in the functionin=\r\ng of collective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them=\r\n and their place in cosmos. And also to internalizing them eventually..&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Whether you call the Supreme Being as=\r\n Purusha or Krishna or Shiva or Surya or Narayana does not really matter, f=\r\nor Scriptures are clear that He is beyond names or descriptions.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;If your devotion to Him is steadfast, if your notion of Him expands with=\r\n time beyond the initial notions you start off with, and if the paramatmams=\r\na in you is able to resonate to Him and the conditioning of your jeevatmams=\r\na is being overcome, that is all that\n matters!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yu=\r\ni_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_63&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote id=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7_2_32_13=\r\n67853193997_66&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left=\r\n:5px;margin-top:5px;padding-left:5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7=\r\n_2_32_1367853193997_70&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;f=\r\nont-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_71&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt=\r\n;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rajarshi nandy &lt;rajar=\r\nshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nb&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n Monday, May 6, 2013=\r\n 8:07 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;y=\r\niv2035484844y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2035484844&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv203548=\r\n4844ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7_2_32=\r\n_1367853193997_80&quot; style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;var id=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui-ie-cursor&quot;&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_81&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGR=\r\nOUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, =\r\nmonaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_82&quot; st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier N=\r\new, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jai Ma!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_7_2_32_136785=\r\n3193997_83&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FA=\r\nMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);F=\r\nONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2035484844yui_3_=\r\n7_2_32_1367853193997_84&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:n=\r\normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR=\r\n:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some freeflowing thoughts that struck me=\r\n while thinking about some of points you have raised.

It is difficult to miss the=\r\n phonetic&nbsp;similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagaw=\r\nata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshn=\r\na. All the major purely&nbsp;Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavach=\r\narya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya&nbsp;as well as the nava-naths=\r\n (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) =\r\n- considered, (with differing nuances on the&nbsp;relation between\n jiva,\n =\r\nparamatma, moksha&nbsp;etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on ea=\r\nrth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest=\r\n Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avat=\r\nara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very=\r\n literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the =\r\nformless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,&nbsp;as merely&nbsp;the aura of Kr=\r\nshna.
