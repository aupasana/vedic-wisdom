I am =\r\nsure none of them is incorrect. The final=C2=A0judge of the success of any =\r\nsustained sadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer=\r\n himself. If the sadhana is making the sadhaka=C2=A0more detached,=C2=A0etc=\r\n etc,the sadhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed.=C2=A0It is n=\r\not the number of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally the int=\r\nernal transformations that you experience which are crucial. There are peop=\r\nle who follow a million rules of procedure for performing various rituals a=\r\nnd yet never experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no trans=\r\nformations. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical=\r\n science. Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not =\r\nis bad. In this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical=\r\n, doable sadhanas, which when done regularly=C2=A0helps to\n transform an in=\r\ndividual.

I had posted a message in jHora in response to a for=\r\nward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jH=\r\nora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n\nI have gone throug=\r\nh the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam bei=\r\nng performed and have the following observations to make.\n\n1. As per rules =\r\nlaid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for var=\r\nious rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamas=\r\na (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n\n2. All steps in darsapoornamasa s=\r\nhould be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka =\r\nform, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential a=\r\nnd which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborate=\r\nd by acharyas.\n\n3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutr=\r\nas such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no o=\r\nmissions.\n\n4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. b=\r\necome worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right p=\r\nrocedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;=\r\nfire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Fr=\r\nits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n\n5. The proc=\r\nedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are larg=\r\ne deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proced=\r\nures. \n\n6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a =\r\nparticular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under =\r\nthe bottom of the prceeding ones.\n\n7. The direction for sprinkling water (m=\r\nantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown t=\r\no be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for p=\r\nitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE cor=\r\nner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n\n8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladle=\r\ns used in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n\n9.Prokshanee samskaram and p=\r\nrokshanam for purification of the utensils is missing.\n\n10. Patra samskaram=\r\n or purifying the utensils is missing.\n\n11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avah=\r\nanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta wit=\r\nh darbha) is missing.\n\n12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is m=\r\nissing.\n\n13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam=\r\n of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n\n14. Darvee samskaram or pur=\r\nification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to b=\r\ne used (sruksruvou) .\n\n15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing=\r\n.\n\n16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni =\r\niis missing.\n\n17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the lad=\r\nle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity=\r\n of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n\n=\r\nand many more ............\n\n18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure t=\r\nhe deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he ac=\r\nts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of d=\r\neity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular=\r\n deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary=\r\n)\n\n18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and th=\r\ne agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is con=\r\nverted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata ai=\r\nkya ahutis.\n\n19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the m=\r\nantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They =\r\ndon&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the ri=\r\nght pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadh=\r\nakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom =\r\nhomam for any devata.\n\n20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fon=\r\nda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an =\r\nable guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n\n21. I sugg=\r\nest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids ma=\r\ny not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge un=\r\ncorrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1269383144-1277038391=:68384\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot; class=3DMs=\r\noNormal&gt;Dear Shri.Rajarshi,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot; class=\r\n=3DMsoNormal&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot; class=3DMsoNor=\r\nmal&gt;1.&quot;Pardon me for being rude, but Frits Staals .......... &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot; class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;T=\r\nEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot; class=3DMsoNormal&gt;I was not referring to the article of=\r\n Frits Staal, but the book written by him called &quot;Agni&quot;,Please go through i=\r\nt if you get a chance.

Let almighty help t=\r\no preserve knowledge uncorrupted.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;There are different homam proceudures followed by different paramparas in=\r\n different parts of India. I am sure none of them is incorrect. The final&n=\r\nbsp;judge of the success of any sustained sadhana like a homa is nothing ot=\r\nher than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. If the sadhana is making the sadh=\r\naka&nbsp;more detached,&nbsp;etc etc,the sadhana is working. If not, more h=\r\nard work is needed.&nbsp;It is not the number of rules that you add or subs=\r\ntract, but it is finally the internal transformations that you experience w=\r\nhich are crucial. There are people who follow a million rules of procedure =\r\nfor performing various rituals and yet never experienced even a drop of div=\r\nine essence, experience no transformations. What use is such rituals for a =\r\nsadhaka? Religion is a practical science. Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach=\r\n God is good, whatever does not is bad. In this light, the homa procedures =\r\ngiven by Narasimha are practical, doable sadhanas, which when\n done regular=\r\nly&nbsp;helps to transform an individual. Many have experienced the same, m=\r\nany more will in the&nbsp;future. And all this has been possible only becau=\r\nse the Divine Mother wants it so. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMIL=\r\nY: Verdana; COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sat, 19/6/10, moulamagamag=\r\nguru &lt;I&gt;&lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: moulamagamagguru &=\r\nlt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa procedure=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Saturday, 19 June, 2010, 12=\r\n:32 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1507322088&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-=\r\ntext&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Members,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nand=\r\ny for guiding me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in respon=\r\nse to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly ag=\r\nree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\n have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the vid=\r\neo of a homam being performed and have the following observations to make.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe =\r\nthe preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikrut=\r\ni of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. A=\r\nll steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some ex=\r\nist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody t=\r\no judge which are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down=\r\n by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. There are variations\n=\r\n in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana su=\r\ntra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. The ordinary materi=\r\nals such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only=\r\n when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a =\r\ndivine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest =\r\nreading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into t=\r\nhe importance of these steps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. The procedure in the manual is not =\r\nas laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions.=\r\n It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. In parista=\r\nrana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in =\r\nwhich the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prc=\r\needing ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkek=\r\nam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be\n from SE c=\r\norner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. I=\r\nt is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi e=\r\neshaantam).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used i=\r\nn the vessel above darbha is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9.Prokshanee samskaram and pro=\r\nkshanam for purification of the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. Patra samsk=\r\naram or purifying the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;11. Praneeta samskaram, v=\r\naruna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of pr=\r\naneeta with darbha) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koor=\r\ncha brahma) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the gh=\r\nee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missin=\r\ng. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou) .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;15. Placement of p=\r\naridhi and aagharasamit is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;16. Idhma\n pradanam or placement=\r\n of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;17. It is seen=\r\n in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahu=\r\ntis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each=\r\n ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and many more ........=\r\n....&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not =\r\ninvoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier fo=\r\nr the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced =\r\nin satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at al=\r\nl deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;18. In =\r\nthe tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni act=\r\ns either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted int=\r\no the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;19. Very good alternate homa\n procedures are available in the mant=\r\nra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don=\r\n&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right=\r\n pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhaka=\r\ns who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom hom=\r\nam for any devata.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane =\r\nFonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from =\r\nan able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2=\r\n1. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. H=\r\nybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve kno=\r\nwledge uncorrupted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY=\r\n&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-1269383144-1277038391=:68384--\r\n\n"}}
