I am not as able enough to add anything new. But I will like to add =\r\nmy two cents here. Please ignore if you think they are not worth considerin=\r\ng.\n\nSir, All atheists are not prosperous and all spiritual persons do not l=\r\nead miserable life.\n\nIt is all matter of our past Karma which are yielding =\r\nfruits to us. Our Deities or Guru, no doubt, test us from time to time. The=\r\nse tests are very much needed to ensure that we are learning well and to ma=\r\nrk an &quot;achieved&quot; point. These tests serve many purpose. failing these tests=\r\n tell us what our short comings are and what we need to improve and passing=\r\n these tests give us confidence and open up next step of challenges for us.=\r\n And many more purposes. More than we can actually think or imagine.\n\nBut, =\r\nI believe, that these tests are not put to us like we think. These tests ca=\r\nn manifest in many many different forms. I think it is not your problems wh=\r\nich are your &#39;test paper&#39;. But the thought &quot;Is spirituality a correct path?=\r\n&quot; instilled in your mind. You are experiencing problems as per your Karma-F=\r\nruit account. But the thought in your mind has been put as a test paper. To=\r\n check what is the strength of your faith. Nothing remains for ever. Neithe=\r\nr good times nor bad times. We should be balanced minded in all the times. =\r\nThese bad times will check your this aspect also.\n\nDeities usually do not g=\r\nive us new problems to face. They just speed up the process of experiencing=\r\n Karma. and sometimes re-arrange the order in which fruits are experienced.=\r\n\n\nJust keep faith and face the bad times with a deep faith on your deity. A=\r\nnd Believe me that you will cross these bad times and will succeed.\n\nSorry =\r\nif I hurt\nregards\nAtul\n\n\n\n"}}
