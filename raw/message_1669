It shares an outline =\r\nof the history of Sanskrit literature, and details the origins of translite=\r\nration into Roman characters. It discusses the various styles of chanting a=\r\nmong sadhus, and describes the differences in the alphabets of the differin=\r\ng languages of India . Then it details the Sadhana of the Chandi: different=\r\n ways of chanting for different purposes. Ultimately it defines many of the=\r\n Chandi Samputs, and describes the siddhis for which each would be employed=\r\n.\nIt&#39;s a small book, a simple book, but I think it is very important for st=\r\nudents of Sanskrit. \n\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone=\r\n suggest a good Sanskrit edition of the Devi Mahatmyam?\n&gt; \n&gt; The current bo=\r\nok that I have is by Swami Jagishwarananda (Ram Krishna Math) and it does n=\r\not have any of the samputikarana procedure as mentioned by Narasimha.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAny suggestion for good translations of the Chandi Paath in English would a=\r\nlso be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

The entire prathama charitra is \n&gt; enclose=\r\nd with Mahakali&#39;s beeja &quot;aim&quot;. The entire madhyama charitra is \n&gt; enclosed =\r\nwith Mahalakshmi&#39; s beeja &quot;hreem&quot;. The entire uttara charitra is \n&gt; enclose=\r\nd with Mahasaraswati&#39; s beeja &quot;kleem&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to enclose any mant=\r\nra with a beeja, the best way is to say &quot;om \n&gt; beeja&quot; at the beginning and =\r\n&quot;beeja om&quot; at the end. For example, you can read \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama st=\r\notram or Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram with \n&gt; &quot;om shriim&quot; at the s=\r\ntart of &quot;shriim om&quot; at the end of each verse, for \n&gt; prosperity. You can re=\r\nad Narasimha&#39;s mantra with &quot;om kshroum&quot; at the \n&gt; beginning and &quot;kshroum om=\r\n&quot; at the end for removal of poisons (material and \n&gt; subtle). You can add &quot;=\r\nom kliim&quot; and &quot;kliim om&quot; (at start/end) to several \n&gt; mantras, including Ga=\r\nyatri mantra, to overcome desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can note that each chapter in C=\r\nhandipath is also enclosed with plain Om. \n&gt; You get &quot;om RShiruvaaca&quot; at th=\r\ne beginning and there is an &quot;om&quot; at the end of \n&gt; the chapter. Placing plai=\r\nn Om at the beginning and end of a mantra is the \n&gt; simplest samputikarana.=\r\n It is used for all the 13 chapters.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When you=\r\n do Chandipath, it is actually fine to use the 3 beejas (aim, hreem, \n&gt; kle=\r\nem) to do samputikarana of *each verse* in the respective chapters. For \n&gt; =\r\nexample, first chapter will go as\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;om aim RShiruvaaca aim om\n&gt; om aim =\r\nsaavaarNiH suurya tanayo yo manuH kathyate.aShTamaH\n&gt; nishaamaya tadutpatti=\r\nm vistaraat gadato mam aim om\n&gt; om aim mahaa maayaanubhaavena yathaa manvan=\r\ntaraadhipaH\n&gt; sa babhuuva mahaabhaagaH saavarNistanayo raveH aim om...&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Like this, add &quot;om aim&quot; at the beginning and &quot;aim om&quot; at the end of each =\r\n\n&gt; verse in first chapter. For each verse in chapters 2, 3 and 4, add &quot;om \n=\r\n&gt; hriim&quot; and &quot;hriim om&quot;. For each verse in other 9 chapters, add &quot;om kliim&quot;=\r\n \n&gt; and &quot;kliim om&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The beeja aim is known as=\r\n sristhi beeja or creative seed. It puts life in \n&gt; material and subtle thi=\r\nngs. Note that Brahma is the rishi for the first part \n&gt; (pratha charitra).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The beeja hriim is known as maayaa beeja or delusion seed. It gives m=\r\nastery \n&gt; over the delusion of this universe and helps one come out of maya=\r\n. Note that \n&gt; Vishnu is the rishi for the middle part (madhyama charitra).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The beeja kliim is known as kaama beeja or desire seed. It helps over=\r\ncome \n&gt; desires and cleanse one. Note that Rudra is the rishi for the final=\r\n part \n&gt; (uttara charitra).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. hom=\r\ne.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; -----=\r\n Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 02, 2009 1:14=\r\n AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: a question on Chandi Paath (Durga Saptash=\r\nati)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes Prasad Bhai,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; as you mentioned, it is a samputa and =\r\nthere are many instances where this \n&gt; &gt; concept is used. let us see if we =\r\ncan get opinion of some members having \n&gt; &gt; knowledge of this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Warm=\r\n Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vvootla=\r\n&quot; &lt;vvootla@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste Utpal ji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    This is calle=\r\nd &#39;samputam&#39; (Lit. meaning a covered box or enclosing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with folded pal=\r\nms as in anjali).
