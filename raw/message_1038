However, despite foreign invasion and complete \nforeign control of India for a millennium, Hinduism is still basically doing \nok. True, some damage has been done, but it is still standing tall and firm \nenough. Isn&#39;t it amazing?\n\nIn fact, Hinduism is a word coined by outsiders. To Hindus, the correct term \nis &quot;sanatana dharma&quot;, i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness. By definition, \nit is perennial. I am firmly convinced that it cannot be destroyed. Even if \nit seems close to extinction, it will come back up. That is the nature of \nthis dharma. I am not worried about Sanatana dharma being damaged or \ndestroyed.\n\nI will continue to discharge what *I* believe nature expects from *me* and \nwhat I believe is *my* dharma, without any worry whatsoever that sanatana \ndharma is in some kind of danger of extinction. However, such a belief is \nvital for some people to discharge *their* dharma and hence we have some \npeople driven by that sense of danger and the resulting fear and anger. That \nis ok too.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSadguru Samartha Ramadas is not an ordinary soul. He is born with an amsa of \nLord Hanuman. His words may be slightly misunderstood.\n\nTo somebody like him, it would not matter whether a nation calls itself \nHindu or secular or whatever. What would matter is whether dharma is \nfollowed or not.\n\nRight now, we do not have sanatana dharma being followed in any country, in \nsecular India or in Hindu Nepal or in many other countries following \nsecularism or various religions.\n\nIf it is indeed God&#39;s wish that sanatana dharma be established in the world, \nit will happen when its time comes.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 6:14 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Hindu Rastra\n\n\n&gt; Dear Members\n&gt;\n&gt; I was hearing of a famous sentence attributed to Swami Ramdas who had\n&gt; told Shivaji &quot;hindavi swarajya whave...hi shrrenchi ichcha&quot;..\n&gt;\n&gt; Which means, to have a Hindu Rastra is God&#39;s desire. Is it really\n&gt; God&#39;s desire? Will such a thing ever happen?\n&gt;\n&gt; Inspite of having so many spiritual super giants born in this land,\n&gt; hinduism and Sanatan Dharma has suffered such terribly at the hands of\n&gt; foreigners.  I wonder why.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly provide your learned views on the same. I am curious to know\n&gt; what others think.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
