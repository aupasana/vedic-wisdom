M=\r\ny mind will be replaying bad experiences, bad decisions, things I feel guil=\r\nty about etc. all while I am on my asana, doing the japa.  Perhaps it is a =\r\n&quot;cleansing&quot; of sorts as these are things I need to let go of? I don&#39;t exact=\r\nly feel at peace by the time I am finished.\n\nAnyone care to comment on my e=\r\nxperience?\n\nThanks!\n\nRaj\n\n\n"}}
