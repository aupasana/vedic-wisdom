For instance: I would be very\nglad to g=\r\net out of this room through this wall, but I cannot; I would be\nvery glad i=\r\nf I never became sick, but I cannot prevent it; I would be very\nglad not to=\r\n die, but I have to;I would be very glad to do millions of things\nthat I ca=\r\nnnot do. The will is there, but we do not succeed in accomplishing\nthe desi=\r\nre. When we have any desire and not the means of fulfilling it, we\nget that=\r\n peculiar reaction called misery. Who is the cause of desire? I,\nmyself. Th=\r\nerefore, I myself am the cause of all the miseries I am in.\n\nTo understand =\r\nreincarnation, we have first to know that in this universe\nsomething can ne=\r\nver be produced out of nothing. If there is such a thing as\na human soul, i=\r\nt cannot be produced out of nothing. If something can be\nproduced out of no=\r\nthing, then something would disappear into nothing also.\nIf we are produced=\r\n out of nothing, then we will also go back into nothing.\nThat which has a b=\r\neginning must have an end. Therefore, as souls we could\nnot have had any be=\r\nginning. We have been existing all the time.\n\nThen again, if we did not exi=\r\nst previously, there is no explanation of our\npresent existence. The child =\r\nis born with a bundle of causes. How many\nthings we see in a child which ca=\r\nn never be explained until we grant that\nthe child has had past experience =\r\n=97 for instance, fear of death and a great\nnumber of innate tendencies. Wh=\r\no taught the baby to drink milk and to do so\nin a peculiar fashion? Where d=\r\nid it acquire this knowledge?\n\nIn the same way, the question was why these =\r\ntendencies are in the child. Why\nshould it have fear of death if it never s=\r\naw death? If this is the first\ntime it was ever born, how did it know to su=\r\nck the mother&#39;s milk? If the\nanswer is &quot;Oh, it was instinct&quot;, that is simpl=\r\ny returning the question. If a\nman stands up and says, &quot;I do not know&quot;, he =\r\nis in a better position than the\nman who says, &quot;It is instinct&quot; and all suc=\r\nh nonsense.\n\nLet us look a little closer into the matter. Say, for instance=\r\n, here is a\nfather. A child is born to him. We see that the same qualities =\r\n[which the\nfather possesses] have entered into his child. Very good. Now ho=\r\nw did the\nqualities of the father come to be in the child? Nobody knows. So=\r\n this gap\nthe modern physicists want to fill with the big word transmission=\r\n. And what\ndoes this transmission mean? Nobody knows.\n\nSomeone takes advant=\r\nage of the light of the sun to break into your house and\nrob you. And then =\r\nwhen he is caught by the policeman, he may cry: &quot;Oh sun,\nwhy did you make m=\r\ne steal?&quot; It was not the sun&#39;s fault at all, because there\nare thousands of=\r\n other people who did much good to their fellow beings under\nthe light of t=\r\nhe same sun. The sun did not tell this man to go about\nstealing and robbing=\r\n.\n\nEach one of us reaps what we ourselves have sown. These miseries under w=\r\nhich\nwe suffer, these bondages under which we struggle, have been caused by=\r\n\nourselves, and none else in the universe is to blame. God is the least to\n=\r\nblame for it.\n\nThe natural desire of man is to go towards the senses. Turni=\r\nng away from the\nsenses takes him back to God. So the first lesson we have =\r\nto learn is to\nturn away from the vanities of the world.\n\nWe are slaves in =\r\nthe hands of nature =97 slaves to a bit of bread, slaves to\npraise, slaves =\r\nto blame, slaves to wife, to husband, to child, slaves to\neverything. Why, =\r\nI go about all over the world =97 beg, steal, rob, do\nanything =97 to make =\r\nhappy a boy who is, perhaps, hump-backed or ugly-looking.\nI will do every w=\r\nicked thing to make him happy. Why? Because I am his\nfather. And, at the sa=\r\nme time, there are millions and millions of boys in\nthis world dying of sta=\r\nrvation =97 boys beautiful in body and in mind. But\nthey are nothing to me.=\r\n Let them all die. I am apt to kill them all to save\nthis one rascal to who=\r\nm I have given birth. This is what you call love. Not\nI. Not I. This is bru=\r\ntality.\n\nThere are millions of women =97 beautiful in body and mind, good, =\r\ngentle,\nvirtuous =97 dying of starvation this minute. I do not care for the=\r\nm at all.\nBut that Jennie who is mine =97 who beats me three times a day, a=\r\nnd scolds me\nthe whole day =97 for that Jennie I am going to beg, borrow, c=\r\nheat and steal\nso that she will have a nice gown.\n\nDo you call that love? N=\r\not I. This is mere desire, animal desire =97 nothing\nmore. Turn away from t=\r\nhese things. Is there no end to these hideous dreams?\nPut a stop to them.\n\n=\r\nSo when you have realized the misery of this physical existence =97 when yo=\r\nu\nhave become convinced that such a life is not worth living =97 you have m=\r\nade\nthe first step towards Jnana.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Th=\r\ne_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_9/Lectures_and_Discourses/The_=\r\nFirst_Step_towards_Jnana\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalas=\r\nutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb56dda26162047301e1a2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:rgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS JNANA&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Lectures and Discourses=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It need not be proved that =\r\nwe are in bondage.
