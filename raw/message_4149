Neal=C3=83 s immersion into =\r\nthe\nspiritual heritage of India under the guidance of Venkatarathnam is\nela=\r\nborately described in his book On the Road to Freedom: A Pilgrimage in\nIndi=\r\na. He now resides at Amritanandamayi Ma&#39;s Kerala Ashram and is known as\nSwa=\r\nmi Paramatmananda. In the following article, details regarding the life\nof =\r\nVenkatarathnam have been extracted from a 25-page essay written about\nVenka=\r\ntarathnam by Neal Rosner. He presented this manuscript to us thirty\nyears a=\r\ngo at Sri Ramanasramam.\n\nWanderings and Company of Saints\n\nDURING the subse=\r\nquent ten years after Bhagavan&#39;s Mahasamadhi, Venkatarathnam\nspent his time=\r\n going on pilgrimage, meeting with devotees, mahatmas and\nsaints, but alway=\r\ns returning to Arunachalam and Bhagavan&#39;s s ashram. In 1956\nSri Venkatarath=\r\nnam went to Kerala on foot and took a vow not to ask anyone\nfor food or wat=\r\ner and to only accept whatever was given unasked. He also\nchose not disclos=\r\ne his identity as a disciple of the Maharshi to anyone\nduring his travels i=\r\nn Kerala, and he did not carry money with him. He spent\nabout six months li=\r\nke this, depending entirely on God, in order to test how\ndeep his surrender=\r\n actually was.\n\nBack in Sri Ramanasramam\n\nIn 1967 the Mahakumbabhishekam of=\r\n Sri Ramana Maharshi&#39;s Samadhi was\nperformed and Venkatarathnam was then re=\r\nquested to serve in the Ashram. He\ncontinued this service until September 1=\r\n969.\n\nRoutine in the Ashram\n\nAt this time Sri Venkatarathnam was very busy =\r\nwith his daily routine which\nwas roughly as follows: 3:30 a.m. got up, swep=\r\nt the room, went to the\nlatrine, etc.; 4:30 a.m., finished bath, sandhya (p=\r\nuja), japa and cleaned\nhis altar; 5:15, went to Bhagavan&#39;s Samadhi, cleaned=\r\n and swept it, and then\narranged for the 6:15 puja. From 7 to 8:15 he perfo=\r\nrmed his own Panchyatana\npuja, 8:15 to 9:15 he did Samadhi puja and from 9:=\r\n30 to 11:30 did japa and\nstudied the Srimad Bagavatam. Then he partook of f=\r\nood. From 12 to 2 p.m. he\nrested or spent the time in visiting and meeting =\r\ndevotees. 2 to 4 p.m., he\nwrote letters, etc; 4 p.m. bath; 4:30 to 6:30, Sa=\r\nmadhi Shrine work, Veda\nParayana and puja; 6:30 to 7 p.m., sandhya and japa=\r\n; 7:30 was mealtime; and\n8 to 11 p.m., miscellaneous activities or satsang;=\r\n 11 p.m. sleep.\n\nFrequently he would go on Giripradakshina during the night=\r\ns after 8:30,\nusually returning only the next morning, and then again start=\r\n the daily\nroutine without even resting.\n\nIn 1967, on May 14th he met with =\r\nH. H. Sri Chandrashekharendra Saraswati\nSwamiji, Jagadguru Sankaracharya of=\r\n Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, for the third\ntime and received from him mantra d=\r\niksha of Siva Panchakshari mantra. He\nalso received a Hayagriva Salagram fr=\r\nom His Holiness. After this he used to\ndaily repeat 2,000 - 3,000 Gayatri m=\r\nantras and 5,000 - 10,000 Panchakshari\nmantras. By the middle of 1969 he ha=\r\nd done 14 lakhs [1.4 million] of the\nPanchakshari mantra. In August 1969, h=\r\ne decided to somehow complete the\nminimum number of japa as recommended by =\r\nHis Holiness and proceed to\nHyderabad to perform the yearly sraddha of his =\r\nparents. To do this he had to\nsit for japa eight hours a day and after fina=\r\nlly finishing it he had a\nphysical breakdown. After some days bedridden, he=\r\n left for Hyderabad in\nOctober 1969.\n\nHospitalization\n\nWhen I[Neal Rosner] =\r\ncame to Hyderabad to meet him, I[Neal Rosner] found him\nin Osmania General =\r\nHospital with a fractured right hip. Riding as a\npassenger on a scooter he =\r\nwas struck by a taxi. When I[Neal Rosner] asked\nhim how he had such an acci=\r\ndent he said, &quot;What accident? Is birth an\naccident? Is there any such thing=\r\n as an accident for a bhakta? It is the\nsweet will of the Lord, that is all=\r\n.&quot;\n\nThe area around his hospital bed literally became an ashram, with photo=\r\ns of\nSri Ramana and Arunachala, observance of occasional festivals like Ram=\r\nana\nJayanti and Karthik Deepotsavam. There seemed to be a continuous stream=\r\n of\ndevotees from 9:00 a.m. till midnight, or later. Usually in the nights\n=\r\nI[Neal Rosner] expected that I could get some rest, but at that hour the\nat=\r\ntending physician, who was a bhakta, used to come and enjoy the satsang\ntil=\r\nl midnight or 1.00 a.m.\n\nAfter four months he was discharged from the hospi=\r\ntal and stayed at Malakpet\nwith Sri V. Srinivasan, who was the Inspector Ge=\r\nneral of Prisons at that\ntime. He and his wife treated Sri Venakatarathnam =\r\nwith the fullest\nhospitality and affection for more than two months. For th=\r\ne rest of his life\nhe was grateful to them for the love and concern which t=\r\nhey had showered on\nhim at that time. This was May 1970.\n\nPilgrimage to the=\r\n Himalayas\n\nFrom Hyderabad we traveled north with Swami Avadhutendra Sarasw=\r\nati and\neventually reached Nepal in August 1970. After Swamiji left us in K=\r\nathmandu,\nwe flew to Pokhara and from there walked seventy miles into the H=\r\nimalayas to\nMuktinath, the Abode of Muktinarayana. This place is sometimes =\r\ncalled\nSalagrama Kshetra and is the 107th Dham on earth, Vaikuntha being th=\r\ne\n108th. This\nwalk was extremely difficult. We often got lost in the forest=\r\ns and were\ncaught in darkness before we could reach the next village.\n\nOne =\r\nnight before reaching Muktinath, Sri Venkatarathnam suddenly got up and\nwas=\r\n loudly repeating Vishnu Sahasranam at about 1 a.m. In the morning he\ntold =\r\nme that he had a vision of people with water pots on their heads, going\nfro=\r\nm a river to a temple which had a big Chakra in front of it. He had woke\nto=\r\n the loud sound &quot;Narayana, Narayana&quot; ringing in his ears, as if someone\nwer=\r\ne shouting it in the room. It was then that he started doing the Vishnu\nSah=\r\nasranam. He said that usually when he gets within a certain distance of\nthe=\r\n destination, he will have a dream about the deity of that place and the\nna=\r\nme Siva or Narayana will be ringing in his ears. When they finally reached\n=\r\nMuktinath, sure enough there was a big chakra in front of the temple as he\n=\r\nhad seen in the vision.\n\nMuruganar\n\nIn August 1973, Sri Muruganar, one of t=\r\nhe intimate sishyas of the Maharshi,\nattained Siddhi in the Ashram. Venkata=\r\nrathnam personally performed the\n40-day puja at his samadhi and also the Ma=\r\nndalabhishekam. During all this\ntime he suffered from chest pain and weakne=\r\nss but nevertheless finished his\nduty to a brother bhakta.\n\nSource: http://=\r\nwww.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd11240a4fc9f0483dbdbcc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nSri Venkatarathnam lived with Bhagavan from 1944 to 1950.
