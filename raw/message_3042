It is a state of intense mental concentration \n&gt;&gt; &gt; on something.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kalpa means create or perceive (the word kalpana is from the same \n&gt;&gt; &gt; root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa means &quot;with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration of the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind, while creational variety or objectification still exists in the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind. One perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;other&quot; objects \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the mind \n&gt;&gt; &gt; intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; many great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In nirvikalpa samadhi, the creational variety and objectification \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ceases (nirvikalpa=nir+vikalpa, nir=devoid of). Mind reaches a state \n&gt;&gt; &gt; where there is no perception of I and &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; consciousness is absorbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), \n&gt;&gt; &gt; without any perception of a variety of objects. This state is reached \n&gt;&gt; &gt; by very very few yogis.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is a state where the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving \n&gt;&gt; &gt; a variety of objects *and* absorbed in the supreme consciousness!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; When one is normally perceiving a variety objects, one&#39;s mind is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; absorbed in an *individualized* consciousness that is colored with the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning of that individual&#39;s experiences over various lives. When \n&gt;&gt; &gt; one sees a beautiful person, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (depending on the experiences, values and desires accumulated from many \n&gt;&gt; &gt; lives). When somebody is praising one, one&#39;s mind may get certain \n&gt;&gt; &gt; thoughts. When somebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s mind may get certain \n&gt;&gt; &gt; thoughts. And so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, dislikes, attractions, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, values and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; desires of that individualized consciousness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In sahaja samadhi, one has no individualized consciousness and one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind is absorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness that is not \n&gt;&gt; &gt; colored by the experiences and conditioning of a single individual. One \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is actively living in the material world; one&#39;s mind is perceiving \n&gt;&gt; &gt; various objects of various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind is engaging in various actions in the material world though \n&gt;&gt; &gt; karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualized conditioning or I-ness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Very very very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; can reach that state. For most others, that state is not really a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; possibility.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I gave an analogy earlier to explain various aspects of consciousness, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; using parts of a computer.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU\n&gt;&gt; &gt; chitta (conditioning) - DRAM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; buddhi - ALU or logic coprocessor\n&gt;&gt; &gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt;&gt; &gt; jnanendriyas - input channels\n&gt;&gt; &gt; karmendriyas - output channels\n&gt;&gt; &gt; praanas - on-board power supply\n&gt;&gt; &gt; deha (body) - mechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Normally, CPU is running a complex program where a lot of input \n&gt;&gt; &gt; channels and output channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored data \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms \n&gt;&gt; &gt; based on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from \n&gt;&gt; &gt; DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person&#39;s normal state.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in a power \n&gt;&gt; &gt; standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all input \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ALU is not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and exits it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Similarly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly \n&gt;&gt; &gt; will resume previous activities. If a computer stays in the power \n&gt;&gt; &gt; standby for too long, it will be turned off and its state may be lost, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot resume previous activities.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer running a bare minimum program \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that accesses a program running on a central super computer on a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and our individual computer&#39;s CPU simply has a small routine that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; accesses the results of the algorithm running on the super computer and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much data \n&gt;&gt; &gt; stored locally and there is no algorithm running locally. One&#39;s praanas \n&gt;&gt; &gt; are supplying power, one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling this \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by \n&gt;&gt; &gt; running a small program that accesses a super computer that is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; monitoring all the computers of the world and deciding what this \n&gt;&gt; &gt; computer should do.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said, very very very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; beyond the reach of even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis \n&gt;&gt; &gt; cannot even reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; come back to regular consciousness after a while and start to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running \n&gt;&gt; &gt; some program or the other, however small, and accumulating more data in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; DRAM and building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; possible, but elimination of I-ness while embodied is very difficult! \n&gt;&gt; &gt; If any limited I-ness is left and any conditioning (I am this, I need \n&gt;&gt; &gt; this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja \n&gt;&gt; &gt; samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connecting the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; supreme universal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I cannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my \n&gt;&gt; &gt; business. I will take on individuals only when they interfere with my \n&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma and my sense of dharma dictates that I should take them on.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only \n&gt;&gt; &gt; yogis of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach \n&gt;&gt; &gt; this state are like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me give another analogy. This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa \n&gt;&gt; &gt; samadhi is like wakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like \n&gt;&gt; &gt; waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the dream and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; yet being awake.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights \n&gt;&gt; &gt; how things work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how \n&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult it is.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and how is it different from nirvikalpa \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; samadhi?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n\n\n"}}
