Then it will be\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; OM duM durgAyai namaH  OM d=\r\nuM durgAyai namaH\n&gt; OM duM durgAyai namaH  OM duM durgAyai namaH\n&gt; OM duM d=\r\nurgAyai namaH  OM duM durgAyai namaH\n&gt; and so on.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But, for sampu=\r\ntikarana with a verse, one convention is to say the verse only once between=\r\n verse. Suppose you are doing samputikarana with . Then it will be\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; .... \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This makes it shorter, i.e. 700+700+1=3D1401. It is of =\r\ncourse possible to do the way you mentioned below also, i.e. 2100 times.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; (2) Good observation! I noted the same long back, i.e. the 24 deit=\r\nies found in one AvaraNa in saptashatI yantra (and among parivAra devatAH) =\r\nare all found in those &quot;namastasyai namastasyai&quot; verses in the 5th chapter =\r\nin the same order, except that dhR^iti and puShTi are missing. I added two =\r\nverses to Saptashati - one for dhR^iti (after lakShmI verse) and one for pu=\r\nShTi (after tuShTi verse). If others want to do the same, the text is in th=\r\ne following format:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; yA devI sarva bhUteShu  rUpeNa saMsthitA. na=\r\nmastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namonamaH..\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Place dhR^iti and =\r\npuShTi in the place of . Add the two verses after the verses for lakShmI an=\r\nd tuShTi (respectively).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Some people may wonder that this will a=\r\ndd 2 to the count of 700. I think the current saptashati counting is anyway=\r\n messed up and we arrive at 700 in a laborious manner. Moreover, there are =\r\ndifferent versions. So I am not bothered about the exact count. It is tough=\r\n to know for sure what the exact original text was. It may be a combination=\r\n of several options available today. But definitely it should include the a=\r\nbove two verses.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I have been reading Saptashati this way for man=\r\ny years now and told a few people I met physically and chanted with, but pe=\r\nrhaps failed to mention it online. I am glad you asked!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (3) I am=\r\n cc&#39;ing to him. If he wants, he can reply.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But please remember t=\r\nhat different bodies have different needs. The food and water schedule that=\r\n worked for him may not work for you. You need to find something that works=\r\n for you. Basic guidelines would be:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (A) Don&#39;t do homam (or medi=\r\ntation) on a heavy stomach. Either (i) eat very lightly and continue, or (i=\r\ni) eat moderately, stop for an hour and continue then, or (iii) eat heavily=\r\n and stop for 2-3 hours. Basically, you should not feel heavy when in homam=\r\n or japam.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (B) At the same time, starving yourself when you are =\r\nstill aware of body and attached to it, is also unproductive. If you do hom=\r\nam for 5-6 hours and feel really hungry and weak, it is not a great idea to=\r\n continue. It will be better to eat a light quantity and continue, perhaps =\r\nafter a small gap.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (C) Apart from how much you eat, what you eat=\r\n is important. If you want to do serious sadhana, eat saattwik food. Don&#39;t =\r\nuse too much oil, don&#39;t eat meat or eggs, don&#39;t eat heavy or pungent spices=\r\n, don&#39;t eat fried food, don&#39;t eat tamasik things like onion and garlic etc.=\r\n Eat simple steamed vegetables with rice, chappati etc and may be a little =\r\nghee or oil. Milk and fruits are also a great idea, though you should not e=\r\nat most fruits with milk (they are a bad combination that will spoil your d=\r\nigestion). You can drink milk one time and eat some fruits another time, et=\r\nc.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (D) I did homam for entire day a few times. I also did homam =\r\nfor half of the day and japam for the rest of the day. I found the latter t=\r\no be more effective. But others may feel differently.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one ind=\r\need gets a chance to spend most of awake time in homam/japam (or even just =\r\nchanting some prayer) for 3-5 days, that will be awesome. For one who may b=\r\ne ready, such sadhana can trigger the next stage in one&#39;s ongoing transform=\r\nation. I know someone from here, who started spending 12 hours everyday in =\r\na combination of homam, japam and reading prayers, and he indeed started th=\r\ne next stage in his ongoing transformation within a few days of that sadhan=\r\na. Of course, we are all different and have different strengths, weaknesses=\r\n, baggages and conditioning..\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------=\r\n--\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; -=\r\n-------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; On Sat, Jan 19, 2013 at 5:34 AM, dgporob@... wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Dear Narasimha Ji and other members. \n&gt; I have been following this=\r\n forum for some time now and joined this week so that I can take part and g=\r\net help with questions I have from time to time.=C2=A0 Hope members of the =\r\nforum would be helpful and share their views. Here are few questions I have=\r\n with Chandi path/homam \n&gt; (1) I read in Vedavani Saptashati book about Pal=\r\nlav, Yojana and Samputa Chandi path. For Samputa patha, they mention to cha=\r\nnt a verse before and after of each verse, so we have 700(700)700  2100 tot=\r\nal verse to chant. Did I get it right here? any other opinion? \n&gt; (2) In th=\r\ne parivar devata aahuti and Saptashati mahayantra (6th circle), we have 24 =\r\ndevatas [Vishnumaya=C2=85=C2=85.Chiti], however, the=C2=A0 5th chapter of S=\r\naptashati,=C2=A0 Dhruti and Pushti are missing, wonder why. I tend to inclu=\r\nde them when I do stuthi mantra alone in the same order as in 6th circle of=\r\n mahayantra. \n&gt; (3) Narasimha Ji, I read that Swami Sathasivom did 1,000 Ch=\r\nandi homas during a 3-month period. I was curious to know how was his day t=\r\no day conduct. Not that I can think of 100day at stretch but could help for=\r\n 3 or 5 days. What I would like to know, what and how much he ate during th=\r\nis period, at what times of day, how much water one can drink. Was he sitti=\r\nng whole day at stretch for 10 homams or did 5+5 homam morning evening? Any=\r\n detailed info I guess would be helpful for all here. \n&gt; Thanking you, \n&gt; D=\r\nigamber\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
