Of course, praying to Thakur is also good a=\r\ns done by many Thakur devotees today. However, when Thakur was alive, he to=\r\nld his disciples mantras of various deities. He would give Kaali mantra to =\r\none, Krishna mantra to one, Raama to one, Shiva to one and so on, based on =\r\ntheir previous conditioning. But Chandi path was one common thing most of h=\r\nis direct disciples knew very well.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe experience yo=\r\nu mentioned is very interesting. It shows what constant repetition of a man=\r\ntra can do. I have seen some people with that kind of ability.\n\nWhen I was =\r\ndoing meditation once, a priest came to my house. He was talking to other p=\r\neople in another room.When I came out of pooja room and joined them, he ask=\r\ned me if I was doing mantra of a specific deity. I was. It is a deity I usu=\r\nally do not meditate on. He just felt the vibrations relating to that deity=\r\n and asked me.\n\nThe same priest came to my house another time. I showed him=\r\n the place I was doing Chandi homam. However, before moving to that place, =\r\nI was doing it in a different place. I had also done a lot of other sadhana=\r\n in that old place. Though that place was empty now and had no indications =\r\nof any sadhana, he just walked to that place, stood there and said &quot;there a=\r\nre very good vibrations here.&quot; I told him that I was doing homam there prev=\r\niously and moved recently.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSuch abilities are given b=\r\ny nature to those whom nature wants to use for certain purposes. Those are =\r\nuseful for instilling faith in people. But those are neither necessary nor =\r\nsufficient for self-realization, which should be the final goal of sadhana.=\r\n One should accept all abilities and experiences that nature gives, without=\r\n *wishing for* any specific ability or experience and without *running away=\r\n* from anything. One should also not let anything that the nature gives to =\r\ninterfere with the final goal and become an obstruction. Something becomes =\r\nan obstruction when one becomes attached to it and lets ego to increase.\n\n*=\r\n        *        *\n\nWe were talking about doing Chandipath fully vs skippin=\r\ng some things like kavacha, argala and keelaka.\n\nI know a young boy who exp=\r\nerienced something special in his very first Chandi homam. He just did sapt=\r\nashloki (7 verses) instead of saptashati (700 verses) because he is small a=\r\nnd uncomfortable with Sanskrit. After he finished the short Chandi homam ri=\r\ntual with some guidance, we both sat down to meditate as the poornaahuti wa=\r\ns burning. In the middle of my meditation, I felt a very powerful energy an=\r\nd jolted out of my meditation by it. I looked at the boy to see what he was=\r\n doing. He was not meditating. His eyes were wide open and he was gazing ab=\r\nove the fire in amazement.\n\nLater, after we wrapped up everything and were =\r\ngetting up, he told me what happened. He said he saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnati=\r\nons above the fire, with his naked eyes. He is a small boy and has no reaso=\r\nn to make things up. Moreover, though I did not see anything with my eyes, =\r\nI did perceive a powerful presence at the same time during my meditation. S=\r\no I can believe him.\n\nWhich specific mantras you read, whether you read eve=\r\nrything or some things, whether your ritual is perfect or not are all secon=\r\ndary to how pure and sincere your heart is and how complete your sense of s=\r\nurrender is. Naturally, small children have a higher level of purity and si=\r\nncerity than we grownups and they can experience faster. Children are mostl=\r\ny simple, while we grownups are complicated beasts of bloated egos.\n\n*     =\r\n   *        *\n\nI want to mention another episode related that boy. Once I a=\r\nsked him, &quot;getting what thing will make you very happy right now? If Shiva =\r\nappears in front of you right now and tells you to ask for a boon, what wil=\r\nl you ask for?&quot; He pondered for a few seconds and calmly replied, &quot;there ar=\r\ne some things that will make me very happy right now. But, if I get them no=\r\nw, I may get bored of them later. Or they may break later. Or other things =\r\nmay come later that I like more. So I may not remain happy later. Instead, =\r\nif I ask Shiva to change and fix my mind so that it is always happy with wh=\r\nat I have, I can remain happy always.&quot;\n\nIn my view, that kid&#39;s vision of Vi=\r\nshnu&#39;s ten incarnations over fire is less important than the above realizat=\r\nion. More than getting experiences, it is important to gain wisdom, clarity=\r\n of thinking and purity.\n\nOne child with well-developed muscles and nerves =\r\nmay still take longer to start walking. Another child with not-so-well-deve=\r\nloped muscles and nerves may start walking earlier and even possibly damage=\r\n his legs.\n\nWhat that small boy mentioned is very wise.\n\nBest regards,\nNara=\r\nsimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedi=\r\ncastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.or=\r\ng\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  --=\r\n--- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ashwin Rawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com \n  Cc: rawalketan@... \n  Sent: Sunday, December 14, 2008 9:=\r\n21 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Maha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam\n\n\n=\r\n        Dear Sir,\n        We are really enjoying this discussion. To exchan=\r\nge our ideas and experiences is really exciting sometime. There was a time =\r\nwhen I was doing Gayatri Mantra constantly. Now I am doing only Thakur&#39;s Di=\r\nxa mantra and after reading your articles I have again started Chandi Path =\r\ndaily. We really experience some sort of energy within us. \n        I will =\r\nnarrate one of my experiences. In 1976/77 I was reciting Chandi Path daily =\r\nbefore Shri Thakur&#39;s Photo kept in the Pooja (worship)cupboard. I was closi=\r\nng that cupboard after worshipping. At that time I was living in a single r=\r\noom only as I was newly transferred from Dwarka to Ahmedabad. One day one l=\r\nady of 35 came to me to show her horoscope. She was Gujarati but was living=\r\n in USA. After some discussion on astrology she suddenly went to trance and=\r\n started saying me that &quot;I hear Mantras of Chandi Path from that corner. I =\r\nsee some white blue rays are coming from that cupboard.&quot; I was surprised to=\r\n hear these words as my Pooja Cupboard was closed and she was not knowing t=\r\nhat I was doing daily Chandi Path in that corner. She was also reading Aura=\r\ns and said to me that &#39;I am seeing Purple and Blue coloured Aura coming fro=\r\nm your body.&#39;\n        I asked her how you got this knowledge? She said that=\r\n she was chanting &#39; Om Gam Ganapataye Namah&#39;  Mantra constantly from her ch=\r\nildhood. \n        This experience made my faith towards Chandi Path more st=\r\nrong. \n        Dr.Ashwin Rawal\n\n        --- On Sun, 14/12/08, Narasimha P.V=\r\n.R.

That is not a bad t=\r\nhing after all.\n\n          In general, chanting in the mind without sound i=\r\ns better.\n\n          When doing a homam, some minimal sound is recommended.=\r\n Even if there is some movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that=\r\n is enough. That is enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical vibration =\r\nof air). When you rely on an external fire, the physical vibration of air (=\r\nsound) forms a connection between you and fire. You use that fire then to c=\r\nreate powerful subtle vibrations, far more powerful than what you can gener=\r\nate.\n\n          When doing japam, internal chanting without lips or vocal c=\r\nords having any movement is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better tha=\r\nt way. When relying on the internal fire alone, physical vibration of sound=\r\n is not needed and avoiding it can help focus the energy and generate stron=\r\nger subtle vibrations.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          You were e=\r\narlier asking about skipping some things vs doing everything fully, in Chan=\r\ndipath. An interesting experience happened in my daily Chandi homam in the =\r\nvery morning after I replied to you. I think it was a Chaturdasi morning. I=\r\n finished the homam and was about to offer poornaahuti. There are a few Ved=\r\nic mantras that I normally read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning ve=\r\nry bright. I closed my eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to=\r\n chant the mantras. But suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mothe=\r\nr was standing in front of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It fel=\r\nt very strongly like she was saying &quot;enough with those mantras. They do not=\r\n matter now. Just give me the poornaahuti, NOW.&quot; I did not think much. I su=\r\nrrendered fully to Her as manifested in my mind. It may just be the imagina=\r\ntion of a fool, but I surrendered to Her as She existed in my mind at that =\r\ntime. I left the standard mantras and just said &quot;om aim hreem kleem chaamun=\r\ndaayai vichche vaushat&quot; and offered the dry coconut in fire with eyes close=\r\nd still. With eyes closed still, I went into meditation immediately. I had =\r\na really nice meditation session.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasi=\r\nmha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- ---------\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologe=\r\nr.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.c=\r\nomcast. net\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- \n\n            ----- Original Message ----- \n           =\r\n From: Ashwin Rawal \n            To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n      =\r\n      Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 9:14 AM\n            Subject: Re: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Maha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam\n\n                  Dear S=\r\nir,\n                  In my journey of 60 years, somebody guided me like th=\r\nis with authority.

The instruction was to spread h=\r\nomam and create a community of sadhakas across the world who worship variou=\r\ns deities in fire. It can be any deities.\n\n                    2. The beaut=\r\ny of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sense of discipline in one. Ev=\r\nen 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting before or after.\n\n        =\r\n            Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas and moola mant=\r\nra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and devi sooktam are =\r\nrecommended after.\n\n                    However, in my humble opinion, noth=\r\ning is really compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be very p=\r\nowerful after a while. I see nothing wrong in it.\n\n                    3. B=\r\noth are correct and work differently. However, those who try who pronounce =\r\nthe beeja mantras as &quot;aing hreeng&quot; invariably misponounce them. The &quot;g&quot; bec=\r\nomes explicit. Ideally, you should start pronouncing as though you are goin=\r\ng to say &quot;aing&quot; and abruptly stop just when you are about to say &quot;g&quot;, witho=\r\nut saying it. It is not easy to pronounce this correctly.\n\n                =\r\n    Instead of trying &quot;aing hreeng&quot; and messing it up, it is better to just=\r\n say &quot;aim hreem&quot;.\n\n                    *        *        *\n\n               =\r\n     Internal purity and lack (or minimization) of individualized ego is th=\r\ne key in any sadhana. Thousands of hours of sadhana without them is fruitle=\r\nss. One who is pure and has a very limited ego achieves results quickly.\n\n =\r\n                   There is a lot of misinformation and unfounded fears tha=\r\nt are spread regarding Chandi path. Do not worry about them.\n\n             =\r\n       Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and desserts before and after =\r\na meal may be recommended. But one can get indigestion from it too. If the =\r\nmeal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy it without appetizers or=\r\n dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and positively to get the most e=\r\nnergy from it. Similarly, read whatever you read with a sense of surrender =\r\nand limited ego.\n\n                    Instead of doing everything with a lo=\r\nwer focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focus.\n\n      =\r\n              Best regards,\n                    Narasimha\n                 =\r\n   ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n\n                    Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ homam\n                    Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n                    Spirituality: http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n                    Free Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n                    Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n                    Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n              =\r\n      ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- \n\n                      ----- Original Message ----- \n                 =\r\n     From: Ashwin Rawal \n                      To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com \n                      Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 6:51 AM\n    =\r\n                  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Maha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam\n=\r\n\n\n                            Dear Narsimhaji\n                            1=\r\n.Since I have joined this group before some couple of months, some previous=\r\n mails I have not read.

Can you guide me the pr=\r\noper uttering of Beej Mantras in Navarna Mantra? some say it is Aing, Hring=\r\n, Kling.... and some say it is Aim, Hrim, Klim......\n                      =\r\n      Thanks with respect.\n                            Dr.Ashwin Rawal\n\n   =\r\n                         --- On Sat, 6/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charte=\r\nr. net&gt; wrote:\n\n                              From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\ncharter. net&gt;\n                              Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re:=\r\n Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam / Re-igniting Fire\n                         =\r\n     To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n                              Cc: &quot;=\r\nnaaraayana_ iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt;\n                              D=\r\nate: Saturday, 6 December, 2008, 5:03 AM\n\n\n                              Na=\r\nmaste friends,\n\n                              Excellent and inspirational w=\r\nriteup Narayan!\n\n                              * * *\n\n                     =\r\n         Earlier, I mentioned the Mother&#39;s instruction to Manish when She a=\r\nppeared in front of him at the temple in Chennai during Shata Chandi homam,=\r\n to spread the practice of regular homam around the world. However, Manish =\r\ndid not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that=\r\n time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should=\r\n teach a simple procedure to him.\n\n                              I experime=\r\nnted with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a=\r\n quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I finally=\r\n got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detai=\r\nled manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as ma=\r\nny people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now!=\r\n I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far=\r\n as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for N=\r\narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started with him.=\r\n What a fortunate soul..\n\n                              * * *\n\n            =\r\n                  It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me =\r\nat the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental=\r\n state would&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been=\r\n more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was=\r\n to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and=\r\n also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up bei=\r\nng more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known t=\r\nhe full story, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and =\r\nI would not have had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself =\r\nto teach homam to Narayan.\n\n                              Manish told me th=\r\ne full story only when I was better prepared to handle the information and,=\r\n of course, I added it to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.\n\n=\r\n                              * * *\n\n                              A good g=\r\nuru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc wit=\r\nh the ego. I remember another incident.\n\n                              One =\r\nday in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day meditati=\r\nng with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out =\r\nof nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only =\r\nsaid &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on till =\r\n9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath an=\r\nd a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was ba=\r\nsically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It wa=\r\ns a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the day.=\r\n\n\n                              I noticed on the next day that the previous=\r\n day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a ver=\r\ny auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1=\r\n000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it bef=\r\nore, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentione=\r\nd this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I knew i=\r\nt earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would&#39;ve distra=\r\ncted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Trite=\r\neya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more =\r\nrajas into the sadhana.&quot;\n\n                              He was absolutely r=\r\night. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride bro=\r\nught rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that =\r\nI was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride=\r\n and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra =\r\nfurther. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent pro=\r\ngress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s wor=\r\nds, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and th=\r\nat he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!\n\n                  =\r\n            Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them wha=\r\nt is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (=\r\nor someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and point it out,=\r\n so that they can weed it out through further introspection and weaken it t=\r\nhrough conscious effort.\n\n                              * * *\n\n            =\r\n                  I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata ch=\r\nandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a =\r\nperfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name of on=\r\ne of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would do s=\r\nome important work in this birth.\n\n                              When I saw=\r\n Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became seri=\r\nous and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more identity? Your ego is already=\r\n strong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha,=\r\n the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seek=\r\ner&#39; etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities and find Tr=\r\nue Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet ano=\r\nther new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well=\r\n be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above=\r\n all identities.&quot;\n\n                              How true and wise!\n\n      =\r\n                        * * *\n\n                              Just as a fat =\r\nand mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given =\r\nby the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the s=\r\npirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master=\r\n may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must conscio=\r\nusly try to restrain ego and increase detachment.\n\n                        =\r\n      Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points h=\r\ne made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evol=\r\nution in this life. Even without giving any specific mantra to me, like man=\r\ny spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would sa=\r\ny the lamp and light were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the=\r\n lamp that was blocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wi=\r\npes off the thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) =\r\nthat encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may b=\r\ne too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n\n                          =\r\n    * * *\n\n                              Homam and other spiritual sadhana =\r\ntools are very helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change on=\r\ne&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people,=\r\n this does not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN ta=\r\nke a long time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path =\r\nand not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walki=\r\nng without distractions will reach the goal.\n\n                             =\r\n The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like homam) an=\r\nd the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go hand in hand. A=\r\nfter a while, there will be synergy between them and they will start to wor=\r\nk together very effectively.\n\n                              Best regards,\n =\r\n                             Narasimha\n                              ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n                =\r\n              Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ h=\r\nomam\n                              Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n                              Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n                              F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n           =\r\n                   Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org\n                              Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n                              ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n                         =\r\n     ---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n               =\r\n               &gt; Namaste Friends,\n                              &gt; \n        =\r\n                      &gt; Some ramblings ...\n                              &gt; =\r\n\n                              &gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or an=\r\nything similar to it), it\n                              &gt; happens with all =\r\nbeginners and its only practice which makes one\n                           =\r\n   &gt; perfect.

It then\n                              &gt; occured to me he w=\r\nas really being serious. So, I started searching on\n                       =\r\n       &gt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I t=\r\nook\n                              &gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not =\r\nsatisfied. Manishji then\n                              &gt; reminded me of the=\r\n book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely\n                      =\r\n        &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish betw=\r\neen\n                              &gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around thi=\r\ns time, Narasimha occasionally\n                              &gt; performed a =\r\nlonger version of the homam and I particpated in it, but\n                  =\r\n            &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, whi=\r\nch he\n                              &gt; did, but still it did not get through=\r\n my really dense brains :). I\n                              &gt; felt really h=\r\nelpless, but the stars were such that I never gave up,\n                    =\r\n          &gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he rea=\r\nlly\n                              &gt; intends that I perform the homa, then h=\r\ne should kindly show me the\n                              &gt; way. In around =\r\ntwo weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided\n                     =\r\n         &gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just could=\r\nnt\n                              &gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant=\r\n-headed omnipotent for his\n                              &gt; grace.

Dont worry about time, we have future lives ...\n          =\r\n                    &gt; plenty of time. These things take their own sweet tim=\r\ne, doesnt happen\n                              &gt; overnight. No matter what,=\r\n complete your homa everyday, that should be\n                              =\r\n&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else.

Similarly, god is capable of doing anyth=\r\ning in this \n                              &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs huma=\r\nn beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this \n                              &gt; =\r\n&gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n         =\r\n                     &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now=\r\n and then.

Just as a servant carries \n                              &gt; &gt; =\r\nmaster&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n                     =\r\n         &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded=\r\n by others as good work tends to promote ego \n                             =\r\n &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar \n=\r\n                              &gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT s=\r\nuperior to a servant \n                              &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 che=\r\nck to the bank and cashing it.

Both are just \n  =\r\n                            &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry o=\r\nut his agenda. Similarly, \n                              &gt; &gt; one who does w=\r\nhat are considered great deeds in this world and one \n                     =\r\n         &gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are bo=\r\nth \n                              &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute g=\r\nod&#39;s agenda in this world. \n                              &gt; &gt; Neither reall=\r\ny owns anything. One may consider oneself superior to \n                    =\r\n          &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by th=\r\ne world, \n                              &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish a=\r\ns a servant who considers \n                              &gt; &gt; himself/hersel=\r\nf superior to another servant carrying something less \n                    =\r\n          &gt; &gt; valuable.\n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; \n              =\r\n                &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully pene=\r\ntrates one&#39;s \n                              &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and inst=\r\nincts, one is safe no matter what \n                              &gt; &gt; situat=\r\nions his previous karmas place one in.

Actually, even listening=\r\n to mantras with all the attention \n                              &gt; &gt; focus=\r\ned is as powerful as saying mantras.\n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; \n =\r\n                             &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra an=\r\nd thinking of \n                              &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the=\r\n mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it \n                              &gt;=\r\n &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n  =\r\n                            &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person =\r\nY may benefit from the \n                              &gt; &gt; mantra. The word =\r\nmantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \n                      =\r\n        &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is=\r\n \n                              &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the m=\r\nind focused on the mantra.\n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; \n           =\r\n                   &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between meditation =\r\nand \n                              &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the in=\r\nternal fire in meditation and it \n                              &gt; &gt; is subm=\r\nitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some \n            =\r\n                  &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opp=\r\nosed to silent \n                              &gt; &gt; chanting or just listenin=\r\ng.

At the minimum, one should ea=\r\nt only vegetarian food on the \n                              &gt; &gt; day of hom=\r\nam and take a bath before homam.

Such a =\r\nperson can think of me or my guru as guru \n                              &gt; =\r\n&gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the \n   =\r\n                           &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimu=\r\nm threshhold of purity \n                              &gt; &gt; through homam and=\r\n other spiritual practices.

The \n                              &gt; &gt; goal of upana=\r\nyanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up \n                 =\r\n             &gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n      =\r\n                        &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; As long =\r\nas one desires no specific material benefits (and \n                        =\r\n      &gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual=\r\n \n                              &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if=\r\n it means some suffering for \n                              &gt; &gt; me.\n       =\r\n                       &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any g=\r\nood date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n                         =\r\n     &gt; &gt; fine?\n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                       =\r\n       &gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n   =\r\n                           &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n                =\r\n              &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n            =\r\n                  &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rai=\r\nn and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n                              =\r\n&gt; &gt; trip.\n                              &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                            =\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n           =\r\n                   &gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific p=\r\nroject). We ended \n                              &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the =\r\nmorning in several places (wherever we were). \n                            =\r\n  &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \n  =\r\n                            &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I=\r\n did not take it \n                              &gt; &gt; seriously.

Manish \n     =\r\n                         &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavi=\r\nly in this city after \n                              &gt; &gt; our homam finishes=\r\n&quot;.

We left for Kurukshetra=\r\n later \n                              &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a=\r\n heavy rain continued for a few days \n                              &gt; &gt; in =\r\nNew Delhi.
