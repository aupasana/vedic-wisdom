The turiya asrama name of this upasaka is\nShri Bhaskarananda Sa=\r\nraswati who happens to be the devi upasaka in\nthe lineage of Shri Vasudevan=\r\nanda Saraswati (Tembe Maharaj). There\nis no whereabouts of this great upasa=\r\nka but I got some of the\nwonderful manuscripts related to Chandi Sapthasati=\r\n Rahasya and Yoga\nGayatri Upasana, its process of meditation and the proces=\r\ns of Shat\nChakra Bhedana.\n\nThough the presentation of entire contents of th=\r\ne manuscripts is\nnot possible for me as the manuscripts runs into 150 pages=\r\n, here is\nan attempt of mine to highlight some of the important points whic=\r\nh\nmay be useful to the upasakas. However, this should be learnt from\nsadgur=\r\nu hailing from sat-sampradaya.\n\nThe 3 charitas of sapthasati are the symbol=\r\nic representation of 3\nknots or grandhis namely brahma grandhi, Vishnu gran=\r\ndhi and rudra\ngrandhi. The chit-AbhAsa (false identification of the sthula,=\r\n\nsukshma and karana dehas to be =EF=BF=BD?oone=EF=BF=BD?Ts own self=EF=BF=\r\n=BD?=EF=BF=BD). This\n=EF=BF=BD?~chidAbhAsa=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is of 3 type=\r\ns: karmaja, sahaja and bhramaja.\n\nBrahma grandhi is the identification of o=\r\nneself with sthula deha\n(sthula deha abhimana). The sthula and sukshma deha=\r\n tAdAtmyata\n(false identification of oneself with gross and subtle body). T=\r\nhis is\nKarmaja Chidabhasa. The annihilation of pUrvajanma vAsanAs in the\nfo=\r\nrm of =EF=BF=BD?oMala=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?odirt=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=\r\n=BD is Brahma Grandhi Bhedana.\n\nVishnu Grandhi is the identification of one=\r\nself with sukshma deha\n(sukshma deha abhimana). AntahkaraNa- chidAbhAsa- ta=\r\ndAtmyata is the\nSahaja ChidAbhAsa. Annihilation of manO-vikshEpa is the Vis=\r\nhnu\nGrandhi Bhedana.\n\nRudra Grandhi is the identification of oneself with K=\r\narana deha\n(chidAbhAsa adhishTAna chaitanya tAdAtmyata). This is Bhramaja\nC=\r\nhidabhasa. The dawn of sva-svarupa jnana when the avarana dosha\n(veil of ig=\r\nnorance in the form of Avidya) is removed is the Rudra\nGrandhi Bhedana.\n\nSo=\r\n, Brahma-Vishnu- Rudra Grandhis are the 3 episodes or charitas of\nChandi Sa=\r\npthasati. The sumedha rishi of Sapthasathi is the Rishi\nHaritayana who was =\r\ninitiated into Srividya by Shri Parashurama.\nParashurama inturn was initiat=\r\ned by Sage Dattatreya.\n\nShri Bhaskarananda Saraswathi explaining the inner =\r\nsignificance of\nSapthsati says that =EF=BF=BD?osavarni=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD i=\r\ns the surya sakti,\n=EF=BF=BD?osvArochisha=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is the svarga=\r\n-sambandha- jyoti,\n=EF=BF=BD?ochaitravamshasamu dbhavah=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD =\r\nis the being born and re-born as\ndifferent species (chitra vichitra janma),=\r\n =EF=BF=BD?okshitimandala=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is the\ngross physical body or=\r\n sarira, =EF=BF=BD?osuratha=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is the jiva who is\nintereste=\r\nd in 3rd purusharta ie., kama and =EF=BF=BD?oSamadhi=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is =\r\nthe jiva\nwho is interested in 4th purushartha ie., moksha.\n\nVishnu-karna- m=\r\nala is the =EF=BF=BD?omala=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?odirt=EF=BF=BD?=\r\n=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?ocovering=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD\naround the chidAkasa (V=\r\nishnu-karna) . During the dissolution, Vishnu\nis one with Yogamaya and henc=\r\ne Chit swarupa. Karna is the sruti\n(ear) whose tanmatra is sound. So, Madhu=\r\n and Kaitabha are the Mala /\nDirt that covers the Nirmala Chidakasa. Madhu =\r\nis the Ananda Lakshana\nand Kaitabha is the =EF=BF=BD?omyriad of insects=EF=\r\n=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD in the form of Sanchita\nKarma. The Brahma which is symboli=\r\nc representation of Manas (Mind)\npraises the Mahamaya to annihilate the Mad=\r\nhu-Kaitabha in the form of\nSanchita Karma. Waking up of Vishnu is the MahAp=\r\nrANa in Action.\n\nSo, annihilitation of Madhu-Kaitabha is the removal of Kar=\r\nmajata-\ntadAtmyata in the form of brahmagrandhi bhedana (Vasana Kshaya).\n\nT=\r\nhe Madhyama Charita indicates the Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana which is\nof the fo=\r\nrm of Sahaja Chidabhasa. Mahishasura represents Rajo Guna\nin the form of Kr=\r\nodha (anger).\n\nShri Bhaskarananda Saraswati also describes a =EF=BF=BD?oSec=\r\nret Upanishad\nVidya=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD which is embedded in Madhyama Charit=\r\na. This is called\n=EF=BF=BD?oJyotishmati Vidya=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD. The Nada=\r\n which the Devi makes is the\nAnahata Dhwani and the Simha (lion) vahana is =\r\nthe Himsa dharma which\nthe sadhaka has to adopt during the upasana. The Jiv=\r\na with Himsa\nBhava should annihilate his Jiva-bhava. The vyashti prana of t=\r\nhe\nJiva dissolves in Samasti Prana. When this is achieved, the Sukshma-\ndeh=\r\na abhimana drops off. This is Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana. This is\nthe victory o=\r\nver sahaja-chidAbhAsa.\n\nThough among the 5 kosas, the Jiva has penetrated t=\r\nill Vijnana-maya\nKosa, he still faces the lack of BrahmAnubhUti which is on=\r\nly through\nAparOksha Jnana. With the dawn of Aparoksha Jnana, the last knot=\r\n is\nremoved which is Rudra Grandhi. With the removal of veil of\nignorance, =\r\nthe avarana drops in the form of Bhramaja ChidAbhAsa.\n\nChanda denotes mUlAv=\r\nidya; munda denotes tUlAvidya; dhUmralOchana\ndenotes bhrAnti, raktabIja den=\r\notes bhOga lAlasa (bhOga vAncha);\nshumbha denotes ahamkara; nishumbha denot=\r\nes mamakara. The 8 armies of\nshumbha-nishumbha denotes:\nghriNa, lajja, bhay=\r\na, shanka, jugupsa, kula, shIla, jAti. These 8\ntendencies are 8 pAsAs (asht=\r\na-pAsa) . To remove these 8 pasas, the 8\nvidya murtis come forth in the for=\r\nm of Brahmi, =EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD..etc.\n\nShri Bhaskarananda Saraswati explai=\r\nns wonderfully the Chandi\nNavakshari Mantra taking the pramana from Damara =\r\nTantra and Shri\nBhaskara. Chamunda is the destroyer of Mula Avidya and Tula=\r\n Avidya.\n\nThere are 3 devatas in Urdhwa Amnaya. They are Viccheswari,\nHamse=\r\nshwari, Samvartheshwari. Vicche is the address to this Urdhwa\nAmnaya Devata=\r\n =EF=BF=BD?oViccheshwari=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD which is the =EF=BF=BD?overy a=\r\nuspicious\ndeity=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD and =EF=BF=BD?oever intent in giving lib=\r\neration out of\ncompassion=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD. This is the =EF=BF=BD?ochitka=\r\nla rupa parama Ardra dEvta=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD\nwhich bestows the =EF=BF=BD?o=\r\npralaya jnana=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD to the upasaka. Moreover,\n=EF=BF=BD?ovicch=\r\ne=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is vit+cha+I which implies =EF=BF=BD?ochit=EF=BF=BD?=\r\n=EF=BF=BD, =EF=BF=BD?osat=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD and\nAnanda rupa of the Chamund=\r\na which is tri-shati rupini as Mahakali\n(aim), Mahalakshi (hrim) and Mahasa=\r\nraswati (klim). To such Chamunda\nwho destroys the Mula Avidya and Tula Avid=\r\nya, I bow.\n\nThis is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya given by Paramahamsa\nPari=\r\nvrajakacharya Bhaskarananda Saraswathi who hails from Datta\nSampradaya.\n\nWi=\r\nth regards,\nsriram\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenge=\r\nr and enjoy!

The sumedha rishi of Sapthasa=\r\nthi is the Rishi&lt;BR&gt;Haritayana who was initiated into Srividya by Shri\n Par=\r\nashurama.&lt;BR&gt;Parashurama inturn was initiated by Sage Dattatreya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sh=\r\nri Bhaskarananda Saraswathi explaining the inner significance of&lt;BR&gt;Sapthsa=\r\nti says that =EF=BF=BD?osavarni=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is the surya sakti,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n=EF=BF=BD?osvArochisha=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is the svarga-sambandha- jyoti,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;=EF=BF=BD?ochaitravamshasamu dbhavah=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is the being bor=\r\nn and re-born as&lt;BR&gt;different species (chitra vichitra janma), =EF=BF=BD?ok=\r\nshitimandala=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD is the&lt;BR&gt;gross physical body or sarira, =\r\n=EF=BF=BD?osuratha=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is the jiva who is&lt;BR&gt;interested in 3=\r\nrd purusharta ie., kama and =EF=BF=BD?oSamadhi=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is the ji=\r\nva&lt;BR&gt;who is interested in 4th purushartha ie., moksha.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vishnu-karna=\r\n- mala is the =EF=BF=BD?omala=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?odirt=EF=BF=\r\n=BD?=EF=BF=BD or =EF=BF=BD?ocovering=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;around the chidA=\r\nkasa (Vishnu-karna) . During the dissolution, Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;is one with Yogamay=\r\na and hence Chit swarupa. Karna is the sruti&lt;BR&gt;(ear) whose tanmatra is sou=\r\nnd. So, Madhu and Kaitabha are the Mala /&lt;BR&gt;Dirt that covers the Nirmala\n =\r\nChidakasa. Madhu is the Ananda Lakshana&lt;BR&gt;and Kaitabha is the =EF=BF=BD?om=\r\nyriad of insects=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD in the form of Sanchita&lt;BR&gt;Karma. The B=\r\nrahma which is symbolic representation of Manas (Mind)&lt;BR&gt;praises the Maham=\r\naya to annihilate the Madhu-Kaitabha in the form of&lt;BR&gt;Sanchita Karma. Waki=\r\nng up of Vishnu is the MahAprANa in Action.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, annihilitation of Ma=\r\ndhu-Kaitabha is the removal of Karmajata-&lt;BR&gt;tadAtmyata in the form of brah=\r\nmagrandhi bhedana (Vasana Kshaya).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Madhyama Charita indicates th=\r\ne Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana which is&lt;BR&gt;of the form of Sahaja Chidabhasa. Mahi=\r\nshasura represents Rajo Guna&lt;BR&gt;in the form of Krodha (anger).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shri =\r\nBhaskarananda Saraswati also describes a =EF=BF=BD?oSecret Upanishad&lt;BR&gt;Vid=\r\nya=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD which is embedded in Madhyama Charita. This is called=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD?oJyotishmati Vidya=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD. The Nada which the Dev=\r\ni makes is the&lt;BR&gt;Anahata Dhwani and the Simha (lion) vahana is the Himsa d=\r\nharma which&lt;BR&gt;the sadhaka has to adopt during\n the upasana. The Jiva with =\r\nHimsa&lt;BR&gt;Bhava should annihilate his Jiva-bhava. The vyashti prana of the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Jiva dissolves in Samasti Prana. When this is achieved, the Sukshma-&lt;BR&gt;d=\r\neha abhimana drops off. This is Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana. This is&lt;BR&gt;the vict=\r\nory over sahaja-chidAbhAsa.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though among the 5 kosas, the Jiva has p=\r\nenetrated till Vijnana-maya&lt;BR&gt;Kosa, he still faces the lack of BrahmAnubhU=\r\nti which is only through&lt;BR&gt;AparOksha Jnana. With the dawn of Aparoksha Jna=\r\nna, the last knot is&lt;BR&gt;removed which is Rudra Grandhi. With the removal of=\r\n veil of&lt;BR&gt;ignorance, the avarana drops in the form of Bhramaja ChidAbhAsa=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chanda denotes mUlAvidya; munda denotes tUlAvidya; dhUmralOchana&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;denotes bhrAnti, raktabIja denotes bhOga lAlasa (bhOga vAncha);&lt;BR&gt;shumbh=\r\na denotes ahamkara; nishumbha denotes mamakara. The 8 armies of&lt;BR&gt;shumbha-=\r\nnishumbha denotes:&lt;BR&gt;ghriNa, lajja, bhaya, shanka, jugupsa, kula, shIla, j=\r\nAti. These 8&lt;BR&gt;tendencies are 8 pAsAs\n (ashta-pAsa) . To remove these 8 pa=\r\nsas, the 8&lt;BR&gt;vidya murtis come forth in the form of Brahmi, =EF=BF=BD?=EF=\r\n=BF=BD..etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati explains wonderfully the C=\r\nhandi&lt;BR&gt;Navakshari Mantra taking the pramana from Damara Tantra and Shri&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Bhaskara. Chamunda is the destroyer of Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;There are 3 devatas in Urdhwa Amnaya. They are Viccheswari,&lt;BR&gt;Hamseshwar=\r\ni, Samvartheshwari. Vicche is the address to this Urdhwa&lt;BR&gt;Amnaya Devata =\r\n=EF=BF=BD?oViccheshwari=EF=BF=BD ?=EF=BF=BD which is the =EF=BF=BD?overy au=\r\nspicious&lt;BR&gt;deity=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD and =EF=BF=BD?oever intent in giving l=\r\niberation out of&lt;BR&gt;compassion=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD. This is the =EF=BF=BD?oc=\r\nhitkala rupa parama Ardra dEvta=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;which bestows the =EF=\r\n=BF=BD?opralaya jnana=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD to the upasaka. Moreover,&lt;BR&gt;=EF=\r\n=BF=BD?ovicche=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD is vit+cha+I which implies =EF=BF=BD?ochi=\r\nt=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD, =EF=BF=BD?osat=EF=BF=BD?=EF=BF=BD and&lt;BR&gt;Ananda rupa =\r\nof the Chamunda which is tri-shati rupini as Mahakali&lt;BR&gt;(aim), Mahalakshi =\r\n(hrim) and Mahasaraswati (klim). To such\n Chamunda&lt;BR&gt;who destroys the Mula=\r\n Avidya and Tula Avidya, I bow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasy=\r\na given by Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;Parivrajakacharya Bhaskarananda Saraswathi who ha=\r\nils from Datta&lt;BR&gt;Sampradaya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With regards,&lt;BR&gt;sriram&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--7--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;=\r\n/hr&gt; Be the first one to try the new Messenger 9 Beta! &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in=\r\n.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_7/*http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/win/&quot;&gt; Cli=\r\nck here.&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-1061573673-1223701214=:32787--\r\n\n"}}
