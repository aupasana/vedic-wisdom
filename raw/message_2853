But, I have few thought I want to put in front of e=\r\nvery one: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. When we meet few people, some we like instantly and some=\r\n we hate. Narasimha once told me this could be due to karmic debts between =\r\npeople. I would like to extend the same to places, form of God/Goddess, tem=\r\nplate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was in Kolkota for 5 years. I went to Dakshineswar several ti=\r\nmes but avoided visiting Kalighat even once. Why? I heard the Kalighat is a=\r\n red light area and you can meet broken with in template premises. Also, I =\r\nheard, that the temple continues to have jantu bali and that the temple flo=\r\nor has animal blood flowing. These may be exaggerations, but, I had develop=\r\ned a prejudice against the Kalighat temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now a days, I repent my na=\r\nrrow mindedness.\n&gt; \n&gt; My mental condition between 1992-97 did not allow me =\r\nto even consider going to Kalighat. My mental condition now will allow it.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Our experiance may depend on our mental condition.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

How ever, if there is beautiful message in Oriya or some other =\r\nlanguage, I may not perceive (I am not undermining Narasimha&#39;s ability to p=\r\nerceive energy).\n&gt; \n&gt; God is omni present. His energy is present any where =\r\nand every where. How ever, we do not perceive it till we are pure and our m=\r\nental and spiritual conditioning allow it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If in a place, there is any=\r\n energy matching our conditioning, we may experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =\r\nVijay\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Before I answer your main question,=\r\n I want to address the following:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, even that spir=\r\nitual person told him that there is probably\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no divine presence insid=\r\ne the idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now my question is, if the ido=\r\nl at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presence why did this=\r\n person suddenly have such a nice meditation there?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Two points:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) One can have a nice meditation session anywhere. While differe=\r\nnt places and times have some difference in the nature and degree of spirit=\r\nual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if the internal f=\r\nactors are conducive.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kali=\r\nghat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind that any observation is =\r\nfallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual ener=\r\ngy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What we ar=\r\ne able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental conditioning=\r\n and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/creative=\r\n/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaching God, is it not enough?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The purpose of an idol =\r\nis to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagin=\r\nes a particular energy or form of god in a particular object on a continuou=\r\ns basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on,=\r\n his mind can be focused on that specific form faster and easier by simply =\r\nlooking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separate entities, =\r\nthey are all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some va=\r\ngue form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus=\r\n, if an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a =\r\nperson trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some si=\r\nmilar thoughts in another person too.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, there is some tran=\r\nslation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perceived and interp=\r\nreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one&#39;s mental condit=\r\nioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to our own mental c=\r\nonditioning!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to an=\r\n idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings p=\r\neople under one&#39;s control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on th=\r\nat idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you=\r\n see her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispa=\r\nssionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone =\r\nused that idol as a repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruc=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, please note that this principle works without an i=\r\ndol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) a=\r\nnd prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are =\r\npresent in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little suscep=\r\ntible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little highe=\r\nr when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, please note that most people have some devotion, some sur=\r\nrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god=\r\n, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are al=\r\nso accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mention=\r\ned is not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable only in rare cases=\r\n of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practices without unders=\r\ntanding what they are doing.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is Idol worship risky?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nGod created man as his replica. But the replica got corrupted with time. No=\r\nw, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so tha=\r\nt he can go back to the source and become free from this cycle. But, due to=\r\n the corruptions/conditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god cor=\r\nrectly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! =\r\nThe goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence ke=\r\nep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pure and create=\r\ns god as a replica of oneself, that god will match the god that created man=\r\n in the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free from the c=\r\nycle.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I saw people deviating and sp=\r\neaking disrespectfully about respected spiritual leaders of other religions=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In general, please remember that saying negative things about p=\r\neople that one may not have understood fully or correctly is unwise.\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; From time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world to =\r\nmaintain the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in that=\r\n part of the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teach=\r\ner based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow that p=\r\nerson. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that person! If s=\r\nome people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of rea=\r\nlization, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we have=\r\n not met physically or otherwise.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one is unhappy because of mi=\r\nsdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or spiritual teacher=\r\n, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct things and change the equ=\r\nilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and do your part by doi=\r\nng sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the cusp of a big cha=\r\nnge in the equilibrium at many levels.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimh=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: rajars=\r\nhi nandy \n&gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, Oct=\r\nober 08, 2009 2:38 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         To add to my query, a good num=\r\nber of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth =\r\nis one, how can it be so contradictory? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         I can understand =\r\nthat a Idol may contain a presence created by human imagination which mayno=\r\nt have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call =\r\nMahakali into an Idol.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         But then, what ever the idol may co=\r\nntain, postive/negative/creative/destruction, if someone prays to it with d=\r\nevotion, assuming that it is reaching God, is it not enough? After all God =\r\nis finally tax collecter of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God,=\r\n irrespective of whether a divine presence is there or not there infront?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         I would like to mention a small incident here about someone=\r\n I know well. There was a certain individual, who whenever he would go to C=\r\nalcutta. he would take time out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of t=\r\nhe idol at the Kaalighat temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and=\r\n sat there trying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became ve=\r\nry focused, he *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his im=\r\nagination) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind=\r\n become without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world, every=\r\nthing was perfect.  Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he n=\r\needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were m=\r\nissing, so he walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though an ext=\r\nremely dirty road but all he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually regi=\r\nstering in his mind that night, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said =\r\nlater on. Bottomline: a nice spiritual experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Some mo=\r\nnths later he ended up meeting a very spiritual person who instructed him a=\r\nbout worshipping the Goddess.  He strongly believes that night at the templ=\r\ne and his meeting with the person was related. Interestingly, even that spi=\r\nritual person told him that there is probably no divine presence inside the=\r\n idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Now my question is, if the idol=\r\n at the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine presence why did this person=\r\n suddenly have such a nice meditation there?  Does it mean that finally it =\r\nis only the devotion of the devotee which counts for spiritual energy insid=\r\ne a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has any energy at all?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         --- On Thu, 8/10/=\r\n09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;           From: rajarshi nandy =\r\n&lt;rajarshi14@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;           Date: Thursday, 8=\r\n October, 2009, 8:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;            \n&gt; &gt;                 Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                 In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worshi=\r\np risky?

How long it takes to disappear depends on =\r\nhow strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                =\r\n   Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will b=\r\ne filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves th=\r\nat place or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly =\r\nit becomes weak and disappears.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   In many famous t=\r\nemples these days, priests have become commercial and do not have the devot=\r\nion needed. The rituals performed every few years to re-energize the idols =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   =\r\nIt is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine pr=\r\nesence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, som=\r\ne not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;                   I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayap=\r\nur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam h=\r\nills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amo=\r\nunt of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where th=\r\ne idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get=\r\n the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutt=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that=\r\n I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over =\r\nTamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never=\r\n heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of=\r\n the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and =\r\nI did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I c=\r\nlosed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I=\r\n was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting ra=\r\nys like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately=\r\n, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a templ=\r\ne without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess =\r\na few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they f=\r\ninally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent=\r\n only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someo=\r\nne from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;                   Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a po=\r\nwerful divine presence across India.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   Apart from =\r\nthe Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditati=\r\nng was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that J=\r\nnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;                   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   Even=\r\n the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple =\r\nin USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There i=\r\ns rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any=\r\n temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that ther=\r\ne is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;                   If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spi=\r\nritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;            =\r\n       Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, =\r\nTiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in so=\r\nuth India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west=\r\n India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and=\r\n Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   There =\r\nare many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a templ=\r\ne once is one thing and staying there for several months while maintaining =\r\na simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) ther=\r\ne is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                   Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;           =\r\n        Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;                   ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt;                   Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;                   Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n              Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;                   Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.co=\r\nmcast. net\n&gt; &gt;                   Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;                   Jyotish writings: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt;                   Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt;                   ----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;                     ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;                  =\r\n   From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; &gt;                     To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com \n&gt; &gt;                     Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;                     Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n                   Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                    =\r\n       I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc=\r\n) in today&#39;s time.
