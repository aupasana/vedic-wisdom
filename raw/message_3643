However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I=\r\n&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n\nI just came across Vimalananda&#39;s though=\r\nt on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is=\r\n only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.\nAlthough=\r\n, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple time=\r\ns difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement=\r\n to answer our queries.\n\nImportant information about Vimalananda which I ca=\r\nme to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was no=\r\nt a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the f=\r\ninal day of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Toba=\r\ncco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because=\r\n as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidenc=\r\ne of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an import=\r\nant thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do=\r\n what he says and not try to do what he does.\n\nNow whatever I wrote above s=\r\neems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thought=\r\ns further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the wor=\r\nth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda=\r\n or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants=\r\n, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high=\r\n level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many thin=\r\ngs in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned =\r\nto universal ego.  In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trik=\r\naal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if the=\r\ny ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually =\r\nknew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind e=\r\nach and every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete backgr=\r\nound behind their each action and moreover their self identification is mis=\r\nsing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to a=\r\nccomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.=\r\n\nRamakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very=\r\n different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him =\r\nwhich can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind=\r\n him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for othe=\r\nrs, a kind of food intake is extremely important.\nIf Vivekananda ate meat d=\r\nuring his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not =\r\npossible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of t=\r\nhat level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst we=\r\nsterners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly =\r\ntry to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable hab=\r\nits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanc=\r\ned Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible th=\r\nat he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by cons=\r\numing its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for that =\r\nbut just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, H=\r\nis Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from dro=\r\nwning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned=\r\n to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for=\r\n the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water and whe=\r\nn he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments =\r\nthought told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and w=\r\nill give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramh=\r\nansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-c=\r\nup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; bef=\r\nore 40 years.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n\nS=\r\no moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding t=\r\no take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sa=\r\ninbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and su=\r\nch masters and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfish c=\r\nruel/unjust actions.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal    \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C2=A0I was about to ask this question=\r\n today on Non-Veg eating.=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eat=\r\ning is not advisable for anyone.=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C2=A0reading a book on Swami=\r\n Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he surviv=\r\ned many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relished it=\r\n.

That =\r\nis why you find a meat-eater reborn either as a predator or prey or as both=\r\n in succession. Human beings cry a lot at funerals of their own kind but th=\r\ney have absolutely no thought for the sufferings of the animals they slaugh=\r\nter. They never hesitate to kill and eat. Just think, first they kill the c=\r\nhicken. Often they will cut its throat and let it bleed to death, which is =\r\na most painful way to die. Then it will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and i=\r\nf it happens to be tough everyone will curse it for not satisfying their pa=\r\nlates. How many humans would give beautiful tender lean meat if they were s=\r\nlaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?\n&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget=\r\n that animal mothers too love their children. Do they ever think of the ago=\r\nny a hen goes through when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a =\r\ncow, the embodiment of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers =\r\nwhen she sees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her o=\r\nwn body and nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?=\r\n\n&gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to =\r\nmother cow? Could they endure their own children being murdered before thei=\r\nr own eyes?\n&gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose i=\r\nntellect is subtle enough to self-identify with another being of a differen=\r\nt species and experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternati=\r\nve but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to tort=\r\nure them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut your throat in this bi=\r\nrth you have every right to cut mine in the next or some succeeding birth. =\r\nExperience is the best teacher and a fool will learn from no other.&quot;=C2=A0 =\r\n\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
