Kanakammal=E2=80=99s Tamil book, Ninaivil\nNi=\r\nrainthavai.\n\n1. Sri Bhagavan was observing the activity of a child, who was=\r\n pointing out\nthat Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s head was clean shaven and so is h=\r\ners, etc. He talked\nabout how observant some children are.\n\nThis led Sri Bh=\r\nagavan to recall an incident about a little girl who used to\nlive in Ramana=\r\n Nagar. She had observed people bringing food and offering it\nto Sri Bhagav=\r\nan and then distributing it to the people in the hall. One day\nshe approach=\r\ned Sri Bhagavan hesitatingly, and upon asking he found out that\nshe had wra=\r\npped a few papads in her dress, having got them from her kitchen\nat home. S=\r\nri Bhagavan and the girl shared the papads. The next day she\nrepeated the a=\r\nct by bringing fruits from her garden. After sharing the\nfruits with her, H=\r\ne asked her if there was a picture of him in their house.\nThe girl said tha=\r\nt they had one. Sri Bhagavan asked her to henceforth offer\nthe food to the =\r\npicture and eat it herself and think that he ate it. (from\nCh. 29)\n\n2. An e=\r\nlderly man walked into the hall and upon seeing him, Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s=\r\n\nbehavior changed: he appeared to behave like an obedient student. The pers=\r\non\nwho entered said, =E2=80=9CBhagavan, please clear all my doubts.=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n\nSmiling and looking at a devotee nearby, Sri Bhagavan replied, =E2=80=\r\n=9CDo you know\nwho this person is? I came away from Madurai unable to answe=\r\nr his questions.\nNow he has come all the way here with more questions!=E2=\r\n=80=9D The visitor was Sri\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s Tamil teacher in school. (fro=\r\nm Ch. 17)\n\n3. One day a devotee pointed out to Sri Bhagavan that someone in=\r\n the hall\nwas sleeping. The devotee added that he has been watching that pe=\r\nrson sleep\nthis way for the past few days. Sri Bhagavan looked at the devot=\r\nee and\nsaid. =E2=80=9CThat person is taking care of the purpose for which h=\r\ne came. How\nabout you? Why have you come here?=E2=80=9D (from Ch. 19)\n\n4.

He became petrified and hastily approached Bhag=\r\navan pointing\nout the snake.
