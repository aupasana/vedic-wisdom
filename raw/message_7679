I only stated the problem and did not even explain how I find it to b=\r\ne a difficult one.\nH.H. : Your difficulty arises in the very statement of t=\r\nhe problem. D. : How?\nH.H. : A conflict arises only if there are two things=\r\n. There can be no conflict if there is only one thing.\nD. : But here there =\r\nare two things, fate and free-will.\nH.H. : Exacly. It is this assumption of=\r\n yours that is responsible for your problem.\nD. : It is not my assumption a=\r\nt all. How can I ignore the fact that the two things exist as independent f=\r\nactors, whether I grant their existence or not?\nH.H. : That is where you ar=\r\ne wrong again.\nD. : How?\n\nH.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you =\r\nmust know that fate is nothing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum tot=\r\nal of the results of your past actions. As God is but the dispenser of the =\r\nfruits of actions, fate, representing those fruits, is not his creation but=\r\n only yours. Free-will is what you exercise when you act now.\n\nD. : Still I=\r\n do not see how they are not two distinct things.\nH.H. : Have it this way. =\r\nFate is past karma; free-will is present karma. Both are really one, that i=\r\ns, karma, though they may differ in the matter of time. There can be no con=\r\nflict when they are really one.\n\nD. : But the difference in time is a vital=\r\n difference which we cannot possibly overlook.\nH.H. : I do not want you to =\r\noverlook it, but only to study it more deeply. The present is before you an=\r\nd, by the exercise of free-will, you can attempt to shape it. The past is p=\r\nast and is therefore beyond your vision and is rightly called adrishta, the=\r\n unseen. You cannot reasonably attempt to find out the relative strength of=\r\n two things unless both of them are before you. But, by our very definition=\r\n, free-will, the present karma, alone is before you and fate, the past karm=\r\na, is invisible. \n\nEven if you see two wrestlers right in front of you, you=\r\n cannot decide about their relative strength. For, one may have weight, the=\r\n other agility; one muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit of\nprac=\r\ntice and the other coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on building ar=\r\nguments on arguments to conclude that a particular wrestler will be the win=\r\nner.\n\nBut experience shows that each of these qualifications may fail at an=\r\ny time or may prove to be a disqualification. The only practical method of =\r\ndetermining their relative strength will be to make them\nwrestle.\n\nWhile th=\r\nis is so, how do you expect to find by means of arguments a solution to the=\r\n problem of the relative value of fate and free-will when the former by its=\r\n very nature is unseen!\n\nD. : Is there no way then of solving this problem?=\r\n\nH.H. : There is this way. The wrestlers must fight with each other and pro=\r\nve which of them is the stronger.\n\nD. : In other words, the problem of conf=\r\nlict will get solved only at the end of the conflict. But at that time the =\r\nproblem will have ceased to have any practical significance.\nH.H. : Not onl=\r\ny so, it will cease to exist.\nD. : That is, before the conflict begins, the=\r\n problem is incapable of solution; and, after the conflict ends, it is no l=\r\nonger necessary to find a solution.\nH.H. : Just so. In either case, it is p=\r\nrofitless to embark on the enquiry as to the relative stregth of fate and f=\r\nree-will.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nA Guide\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nD. : D=\r\noes Yor Holiness then mean to say that we must resign ourselves to fate?\nH.=\r\nH. : Certainly not. On the other hand, you must devote yourself to free-wil=\r\nl.\n\nD. : How can that be?\nH.H. : Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of t=\r\nhe past exercise of your free-will. By exercising your free-will in the pas=\r\nt, you brought on the resultant fate.\nBy exercising your free-will in the p=\r\nresent, I want you to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add =\r\nto it if you find it enjoyable.\nI any case. whether for acquiring more happ=\r\niness or for reducing misery. you have to exercise your free-will in the pr=\r\nesent.\n\nD. : But the exercise of free-will however well-directed, very ofte=\r\nn fails to secure the desired result, as fate steps in and nullifies the ac=\r\ntion of free-will.\nH.H. : You are again ignoring our definition of fate. It=\r\n is not an extraneous and a new thing which steps in to nullify your free-w=\r\nill. On the other hand, it is already in yourself.\n\nD. : It may be so, but =\r\nits existence is felt only when it comes into conflict with free-will. How =\r\ncan we possibly wipe out the past record when we do not know nor have the m=\r\neans of knowing what it is?\nH.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced sou=\r\nls, the past certainly remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is ver=\r\ny often an advantage to us. For, if we happen to know all the results we ha=\r\nve accumulated by our actions in this and our past lives, we will be so muc=\r\nh shocked as to give up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitigate them=\r\n. Even in this life, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful God has been=\r\n pleased to bestow on us, so that we may not be burdened at any moment with=\r\n a recollection of all that has happened in the past.\n\nSimilarly, the divin=\r\ne spark in us is ever bright with hope and makes it possible for us to conf=\r\nidently exercise our free-will. It is not for us to belittle the significan=\r\nce of these two boons--\nforgetfulness of the past and hope for the future.\n=\r\n\nD. : Our ignorance of the past may be useful in not deterring the exercise=\r\n of the free-will, and hope may stimulate that exercise. All the same, it c=\r\nannot be denied that fate very often does present a formidable obstacle in =\r\nthe way of such exercise.\n\nH.H. : It is not quite correct to say that fate =\r\nplaces obstacles in the way of free-will. On the other hand, by seeming to =\r\noppose our efforts, it tells us what is the extent of free-will that is nec=\r\nessary now to\nbear fruit.\n\nOrdinarily for the purpose of securing a single =\r\nbenefit, a particular activity is prescribed; but we do not know how intens=\r\nively or how repeatedly that activity has to be pursued or pesisted in.\n\nIf=\r\n we do not succed at the very first attempt, we can easily deduce that in t=\r\nhe past we have exercised our free-will just in the opposite direction, tha=\r\nt the resultant of that past activity has first to be eliminated and that o=\r\nur present effort must be proportionate to that past activity.\n\nThus, the o=\r\nbstacle which fate seems to offer is just the gauge by which we have to gui=\r\nde our present activities.\n\nH.H. : The obstacle is seen only after the exer=\r\ncise of our free-will; how can that help us to guide our activities at the =\r\nstart?\nH.H. : It need not guide us at the start. At the start, you must not=\r\n be obsessed at all with the idea that there will be any obstacle in your w=\r\nay. Start with boundless hope and with the rpesumption that there is nothin=\r\ng in the way of your exercising the free-will.\n\nIf you do not succeed, tell=\r\n yourself then that there has been in the past a counter-influence brought =\r\non by yourself by exercising your free-will in the other direction and, the=\r\nrefore, you must now exercise your free-will with re-doubled vogor and pers=\r\nistence to achieve your object.\n\nTell yourself that, inasmuch as the seemin=\r\ng obstacle is of your own making, it is certainly within your competence to=\r\n overcome it. If you do not succeed even after this renewed effort, there c=\r\nan be absolutely no justification for despair, for fate being but a creatur=\r\ne of your free-will can never be stronger than your free-will.\n\nYour failur=\r\ne only means that your present exercise of free-will is not sufficient to c=\r\nounteract the result of the past exercise of it.\n\nIn other words, there is =\r\nno question of a relative proportion between fate and free-will as distinct=\r\n factors in life. The relative proportion is only as between the intensity =\r\nof our past action and\nthe intensity of our present action.\n\nD. : But even =\r\nso, the relative intensity can be realised only at the end of our present e=\r\nffort in a particular direction. \nH.H. : It is always so in the case of eve=\r\nrything which is adrishta or unseen. Take, for example, a nail driven into =\r\na wooden pillar. When you see it for the first time, you actually see, say,=\r\n an inch of it\nprojecting out of the pillar. The rest of it has gone into t=\r\nhe wood and you cannot now see what exact length of the nail is imbedded in=\r\n the wood. That length, therefore, is unseen or adrishta, so far as\nyou are=\r\n concerned. Beautifully varnished as the pillar is, you do not know what is=\r\n the composition of the wood in which the nail is driven. That also is unse=\r\nen or adrishta.\n\nNow, suppose you want to pull that nail out, can you tell =\r\nme how many pulls will be necessary and how powerful each pull has to be?\n\n=\r\nD. : How can I? The number and the intensity of the pulls will depend upon =\r\nthe length which has gone into the wood.\n\nH.H. : Certainly so. And the leng=\r\nth which has gone into the wood is not arbitrary, but depended upon the num=\r\nber of strokes which drove it in and the intensity of each of such strokes =\r\nand the resistance which the wood offered to them.\nD. : It is so.\nH.H. : Th=\r\ne number and intensity of the pulls needed to take out the nail depend ther=\r\nefore upon the number and intensity of the strokes which drove it in.\nD. : =\r\nYes.\nH.H. : But the strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unsee=\r\nable.\nThey relate to the past and are adrishta.\nD. : Yes.\nH.H. : Do we stop=\r\n from pulling out the nail simply because we happen to be ignorant of the l=\r\nength of the nail in the wood or of the number and intensity of the strokes=\r\n which drove it in? Or, do we persist in\npulling it out by increasing our e=\r\nffort?\nD. : Certainly, as practical men we adopt the latter course.\nH.H. : =\r\nAdopt the same course in every effort of yours. Exert yourself as much as y=\r\nou can. Your will must succeed in the end.\n \n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nFunction of Shastras:\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D \nD. : But there certainly =\r\nare many things which are impossible to attain even after the utmost exerti=\r\non.\nH.H. : There you are mistaken. There is nothing which is really unattai=\r\nnable. A thing, however, may be unattainable to us at the particular stage =\r\nat which we are, or with the qualifications that we\npossess. The attainabil=\r\nity or otherwise of a particular thing is thus not an absolute characterist=\r\nic of that thing but is relative and proportionate to our capacity to attai=\r\nn it.\n\nD. : The success or failure of an effort can be known definitely onl=\r\ny at the end. How are we then to know beforehand whether with our present c=\r\napacity we may or may not exert ourselves to attain a\nparticular object, an=\r\nd whether it is the right kind of exertion for the attainment of that objec=\r\nt?\n\nH.H. : Your question is certainly a pertinent one. The whole aim of our=\r\n Dharma Shastras is to give a detailed answer to your question. Religion do=\r\nes not fetter man&#39;s free-will. It leaves him quite\nfree to act, but tells h=\r\nim at the same time what is good for him and what is not.\nThe resposibility=\r\n is entirely and solely his. He cannot escape it by blaming fate, for fate =\r\nis of his own making, nor by blaming God, for he is but the dispenser of fr=\r\nuits in accordance with the merits of\nactions. You are the master of your o=\r\nwn destiny. It is for you to make it, to better it or to mar it. This is yo=\r\nur privilege. This is your responsibility.\n\nD. : I quite realise this. But =\r\noften it so happens that I am not really master of myself. I know, for inst=\r\nance, quite well that a particular act is wrong; at the same time, I feel i=\r\nmpelled to do it. Similarly,\nI know that another act is right; at the same =\r\ntime, however, I feel powerless to do it. It seems that there is some power=\r\n which is able to control or defy my free-will. So long as that power is po=\r\ntent, how can I be called the master of my own destiny? What is that power =\r\nbut fate?\n\nH.H. : You are evidently confusing together two distinct things.=\r\n Fate is a thing quite different from the other one which you call a power.=\r\n Suppose you handle an instrument for the first time. You will do it\nvery c=\r\nlumsily and with great effort. The next time, however, you use it, you will=\r\n do so less clumsily and with less effort. With repeated uses, you will hav=\r\ne learnt to use it easily and without any effort. That is, the facility and=\r\n ease with which you use a particular thing increase with the number of tim=\r\nes you use it.\n\nThe first time a man steals, he does so with great effort a=\r\nnd much fear; the next time both his effort and fear are much less. As oppo=\r\nrtunities increase, stealing will become a normal habit with him and will r=\r\nequire no effort at all. This habit will generate in him a tendency to stea=\r\nl even when there is no  necessity to steal. It is this tendency which goes=\r\n by the name vasana. The power which makes you act as if against your will =\r\nis only the vasana which itself is of your own making. This is not fate.\n\nT=\r\nhe punishment or reward, in the shape of pain or pleasure, which is the ine=\r\nvitable consequence of an act, good or bad, is alone the province of fate o=\r\nr destiny.\n\nThe vasana which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind =\r\nin the shape of a taste, a greater facility or a greater tendency for doing=\r\n the same act once again, is quite a different thing. It may be that the pu=\r\nnishment or the reward of the past act is, in ordinary circumstances, unavo=\r\nidable, if there is no counter-effort; but the vasana can be easily handled=\r\n if only we exercise our free-will correctly.\n\nD. : But the number of vasan=\r\nas or tendencies that rule our hearts are endless. How can we possibly cont=\r\nrol them?\nH.H. : The essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression in =\r\noutward acts. This characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and bad. T=\r\nhe stream of vasanas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two\ncurrents, =\r\nthe good and the bad.\n\nIf you try to dam up the entire stream, there mey be=\r\n danger. The Shastras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On the ot=\r\nher hand, they ask you to submit yourself to be led by the good vasana curr=\r\nent and to resist being led away by the bad vasana current.\n\nWhen you know =\r\nthat a particular vasana is rising up in your mind, you cannot possibly say=\r\n that you are at its mercy. You have your wits about you and the responsibi=\r\nlity of deciding whether you will encourage it or not is entirely yours. Th=\r\ne Shastras ennciate in detail what vasanas are good and\nhave to be encourag=\r\ned and what vasanas are bad and have to beovercome.\n\nWhen, by dint of pract=\r\nice, you have made all your vasanas good and practically eliminated the cha=\r\nrge of any bad vasanas leading you astray, the Shastras take upon themselve=\r\ns the function of teaching you how to free your free-will even from the nee=\r\nd of being led by good vasanas.\n\nYou will gradually be led on to a stage wh=\r\nen your free-will be entirely free from any sort of coloring due to any vas=\r\nanas. \n\nAt that stage, your mind will be pure as crystal and all motive for=\r\n particular action will cease to be. Freedom from the results of particular=\r\n actions is an inevitable consequence. Both fate and vasana disappear. Ther=\r\ne is freedom for ever more and that freedom is called Moksha.\n_____________=\r\n_______________________________________________________________\n \n.. shrii =\r\nshaN^karaarpaNamastu ..\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
