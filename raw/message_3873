I have such love for t=\r\nhe family that I don&#39;t start my day without praying to all the four! Daily =\r\nI do abhishekham for a small Spatika Lingam, in which I see both Shiva and =\r\nParvathi, I do ganapathi mantra japam everyday and I recite Subramanya Kara=\r\nvalamba stotram. When I don&#39;t do it, it is not=C2=A0a day for me. (&#39;Deva De=\r\nvuni Chintinchu dinamu dinamu.......&#39; !) And I get tears when I listen to B=\r\nhagavatam or Thyagaraja/Dikshitar/Annamayya=C2=A0et al...=C2=A0Krithis. In =\r\nspite of having won some recognition in my small community as a musician/vi=\r\ndwan, releasing a CD playing my chosen instrument Veena, I cannot even sing=\r\n some compositons some times because of the overwhelming emotion. And those=\r\n are some songs on Shiva, Parvati, Rama and\n Krishna. \n=C2=A0\nBut if I have=\r\n to narrow down to one name, I don&#39;t know how and how to leave any one form=\r\n! Anyway, that apart, I did Gayatri Sadhana for sometime now and want to co=\r\nntinue someday in the method you/Manishji suggested, like the hundred day d=\r\niksha! I don&#39;t know when the time will come for that! I don&#39;t know if it is=\r\n good to announce the mantra that I practise, contrary to Sri Vimalananda&#39;s=\r\n advice, but again.. oh well!... \n=C2=A0\nIn the meanwhile my Sadhana of=C2=\r\n=A0Ganapathi homam on Sundays,=C2=A0nitya pooja everyday=C2=A0are=C2=A0cont=\r\ninuing, by God&#39;s grace! But then they are eating into my music practise tim=\r\ne! Again, the=C2=A0positive side is, when I practise these days, the practi=\r\nse is so much more rewarding..........! I cannot express it well here......=\r\n.......\n=C2=A0\nBTW, Since this group is such an understanding group and=C2=\r\n=A0one that always gives a positive energy, I want to confess something her=\r\ne. I have a weakness for alcoholic drinks, that I take almost every weekend=\r\n, because of the kind of company I have here.=C2=A0Although over-indulgence=\r\n in that sometimes weakens my resolve to do any kind of Sadhanas,=C2=A0my n=\r\normal weekend poojas/daily poojas/music practise=C2=A0do not suffer at all =\r\nbecause of this.

If priest was aware and still did that, then I can\n&gt; understand the =\r\nconsequence.\n\nIf one goes in the path of a tornado, aware or unaware that a=\r\n tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it.\n\nIf the question is o=\r\nf fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc sh=\r\nould kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natural order of the univer=\r\nse is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an &quot;order&quot;. Your actions gets opp=\r\nosite reactions. You experience the fruits of your actions, as determined b=\r\ny the order of nature. A person may happen to be doing what he sees as his =\r\ndharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him. If so, there must be a=\r\n previous karma as a result of which he is placed there at that time.\n\nIn t=\r\nhe case of the priest in the story, his mistake is that he slapped a person=\r\n worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the =\r\nmind of the person doing the worship, he should&#39;ve given the benefit of dou=\r\nbt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather than assuming it was a fool=\r\n.\n\nSee, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately =\r\nknew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanatha himself. However, oth=\r\ners may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body with some body parts and s=\r\nome clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and tre=\r\nat kindly and respectfully. Just because of external parameters, do not jud=\r\nge a person and act harsh.\n\nHitting a person who still has a limited self-i=\r\ndentification is one thing and hitting a person who has no limited self-ide=\r\nntification and identifies with the entire universe or with a deity is diff=\r\nerent.\n\n* * *\n\nIn any case, do not worry about that priest that much. For a=\r\nll you know, he may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga S=\r\nwami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva.=\r\n Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important role in an interesting div=\r\nine drama.\n\n* * *\n\nJeevanmuktas may engage in actions that are difficult to=\r\n comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. They become instru=\r\nments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swami =\r\nmay help several people question, challenge and overcome their biases and l=\r\nearn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.\n\n* * *\n\nRegardi=\r\nng many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give advice=\r\ns based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a specific set of people.=\r\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong in having many deities in pooja room and worshippi=\r\nng all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda m=\r\nay not be concerned about such people. His teachings may be addressed at so=\r\nme other people to come in the coming years who he has rina with and who ar=\r\ne meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some work. There is an i=\r\nntended audience for every work and no work can be perfect for all audience=\r\n.\n\nIf the goal is either liberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) or saayuj=\r\nya (company), one has to agree that focusing on one deity is the best thing=\r\n to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deities and keep switching.=\r\n A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled with that deity&#39;s name=\r\n and mantra and other thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda p=\r\nerhaps wanted to motivate several people to strive for vision/company of de=\r\nities. He probably thought some people he has a rina with would come to ear=\r\nth with such a potential.\n\n* * *\n\nThyagaraja did compose songs on many deit=\r\nies. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years chanting R=\r\nama&#39;s name and had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deities. Howev=\r\ner, he saw all of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Rama in al=\r\nl.\n\nSame with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and o=\r\nthers.\n\nWhen one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity, one&#39;s life =\r\nis made. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities even if he =\r\nworships 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities before that, =\r\nit may not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any of those dei=\r\nties. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not fully surren=\r\nder to any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life=\r\n. That&#39;s fine.\n\nBut, if you really want to taste the nectar of complete sur=\r\nrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind with his/her thoug=\r\nhts.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed her divin=\r\ne\n&gt; grace through you that I am able to find answers to many\n&gt; questions th=\r\nat my immature mind keeps on asking! \n\nThough I had some spiritual experien=\r\nces fortunately, I am not a realized person. I too am a normal person with =\r\nan immature mind. But my guru blessed me that I will be able to give excell=\r\nent replies to spiritual questions if I think of him and then write what co=\r\nmes to my mind. That is what I have been doing.

If priest was aware and still did that, then I ca=\r\nn understand the consequence. I haven&#39;t yet the second book though!

But contrary to that we find great saints / composers / poet=\r\ns from India have indeed worshipped many forms of the God and were successf=\r\nul in that approach as well. For instance, there is not a single deity form=\r\n that was not worshipped by Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It w=\r\nas famous that Muththuswamy Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka a=\r\nnd he left his mortal coil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the prese=\r\nnce of many of his disciples. But he composed songs of deep devotion that h=\r\nave immense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so=\r\n on. So was Thyagaraja. So were many great composers of Carnatic Music in t=\r\nhat path. In fact they were all great advaitis and never saw any difference=\r\n between any form of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of=\r\n Andhra who\n&gt; translated Bhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems, pays =\r\nhomage to Lord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, La=\r\nkshmi in that order before declaring that he got the divine inspiration fro=\r\nm Lord Rama to write the Stories of Krishna! Where is the difference betwee=\r\nn any form of God here! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vima=\r\nlananda accuses many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just because their puj=\r\na mandirams are filled with many photographs/ idols of different murthis of=\r\n Almighty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent answers on =\r\neach thread and mother showed her divine grace through you that I am able t=\r\no find answers to many questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing =\r\nin the first book of Aghora are as follows: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. On the page 45 it says=\r\n that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with his=\r\n own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this bizarre =\r\nbehavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, because in my opini=\r\non, anyone else would have done the same in the least! Since you have an ex=\r\ncellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I hope to find and=\r\n answer here. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda equates changing =\r\nthe loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitution, which I find as an=\r\n extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara compose so many hym=\r\nns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in the praise of Sri R=\r\nama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So are so many great co=\r\nmposers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where they wanted=\r\n to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the case of former and kris=\r\nhna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the other form is the same =\r\nsupreme being, are only a very minority in the list of Bhaktas that we have=\r\n? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally in the love and awe o=\r\nf every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, subramanya=\r\n, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR =\r\nRao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter.=\r\n net&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora books..)\n&gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How to achieve it effectivey?\n&gt; \n&gt; If it can be a=\r\nchieved easily, we will not have so many spiritual paths and so many sadhan=\r\nas.

Look at your belongings (spouse, children, job, house, cars, wealth=\r\n, name, fame, and even body) as the property of god.

A servant takes the best care of his master&#39;s property, but does=\r\n not get attached. Do not be attached anything and yet take the best possib=\r\nle care. If something goes wrong, do not worry too much and tell yourself t=\r\nhat the master will take care of it when he gets a chance to look at it. Th=\r\nink for a moment how a servant taking care of the properties of a master li=\r\nving away thinks and behaves.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one can attain the spirit and mental =\r\nstate of the servant in this analogy, one&#39;s life will be made.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Read what Manish wrote below:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you take Time out of the eq=\r\nuation (because a deity has a different time space frame which runs in thou=\r\nsands of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waiting with patience=\r\n, then where will God go?

Why is God not coming?&quot; Wait patiently. After al=\r\nl, if you have truly surrendered, why is it a problem then to wait, let us =\r\nsay, 1000 years for Her grace? If you say &quot;I want Her to come in 1 year or =\r\n10 years and not 1000 years&quot;, that means you have not fully surrendered.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How to measure it?\n&gt; \n&gt; One can measure it by seeing how on=\r\ne is internally reacting to challenging circumstances that would earlier pr=\r\novoke lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc inside one.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, what will o=\r\nne do by measuring?

Only by=\r\n becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but w=\r\nhen he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna w=\r\nas within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, but Arjun=\r\n could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play o=\r\nf course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a frien=\r\nd ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the=\r\n Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now onc=\r\ne Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nrishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the bat=\r\ntle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who had been decap=\r\nitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive at the =\r\ntop of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s v=\r\nictory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at the beginning of the=\r\n day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of the batt=\r\nlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would return to =\r\nkrishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being=\r\n spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was luck=\r\ny, He had God incarnate at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so for=\r\ntunate. For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thriving surgical career when I read this a fe=\r\nw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money ear=\r\nned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that t=\r\nime).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. S=\r\nurrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freely admitted to the Lord when I had His darsh=\r\nana that I was a complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fool and knew nothing at all. She taught =\r\nme all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever you ever do in life, just t=\r\nry and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have with anybody, giv=\r\ne whatever you can, turn away nobody from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your door, who knows when=\r\n God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does not mean that one is=\r\n fatalistic and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that terrific sadhana is=\r\n useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana and a real Guru (Gu k=\r\nara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cha Teja Uchayte- br=\r\nings light into the being), are essential. Before I met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my real Gur=\r\nu, I saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas themselves, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; u=\r\nsed to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, how will you lead\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God yourself face to face=\r\n?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (because a d=\r\neity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousands of ye=\r\nars which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with patience, t=\r\nhen where will God go? God has to come, He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 2=\r\n7, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you see the old mail quoted by Hemanth below=\r\n, it will answer your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just because =\r\na group of people think something is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does =\r\nnot free them from karma.

As one beco=\r\nmes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s dharma becomes clearer to one. The sense of dhar=\r\nma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditioned mind is corrupted by that conditionin=\r\ng.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, even doing one&#39;s true dharma does not mean=\r\n one does not incur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma. If Nature selects someone, because of =\r\none&#39;s prior conditioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts, to kill thousand bad people, =\r\nand one fulfils dharma by killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thousand bad people, that perso=\r\nn WILL incur new karma for it. Dharma (duty)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (liberati=\r\non) are two different purusharthas and not one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfilling dharma=\r\n is helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addi=\r\ntion to doing dharma, one needs to overcome ego (I-ness) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doer=\r\nship. As ego and the sense of doership goes down, the speed at which new\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. Dharma becomes clearer. For liberati=\r\non, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and the sense of doership and do one&#39;s=\r\n dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) without attachment and doership.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key concepts an=\r\nd worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n&lt;http://www.vedicast rologer.org/ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@ ...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard that Muslims used to behead meditating sages hea=\r\nd when they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma is to k=\r\nill other religious people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims attact bad karma or =\r\nsin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@. ..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even =\r\nI think one has to follow Dharma.

Krishna clearly says in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dhar=\r\nma. It is dangerous to follow someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the=\r\n right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, =\r\nfrom time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on w=\r\nhat nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you =\r\nhave been in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while i=\r\ndentifying with the action, who you affected in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated=\r\n until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to =\r\nkill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to sp=\r\nread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that=\r\n becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tend=\r\nencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ri=\r\ntual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a per=\r\nson to make a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, th=\r\nat becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill =\r\nhis gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that th=\r\nere was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted ea=\r\nrth to be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruc=\r\ntion was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exte=\r\nnt,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being =\r\na great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that=\r\n. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other s=\r\nide and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the sa=\r\nme Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce materi=\r\nal life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple=\r\n life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple lif=\r\ne of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born a=\r\ngain (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharm=\r\na based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide=\r\n what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted=\r\n Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and n=\r\not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; con=\r\ncept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long tim=\r\ne, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there.=\r\n Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a b=\r\nrahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshat=\r\nrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to =\r\nin childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna=\r\n based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretatio=\r\nn of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dha=\r\nrma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If =\r\none is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all =\r\nof us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our =\r\ndharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other pa=\r\nrts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discri=\r\nmination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma =\r\nand follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than follo=\r\nwing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actio=\r\nns without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should =\r\nengage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment=\r\n on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with =\r\nas little attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as=\r\n possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resul=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now=\r\n&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (u=\r\nnfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and pu=\r\nrify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, ou=\r\nr mind will work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This =\r\nis not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s=\r\n dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refi=\r\nned with time if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another exte=\r\nrnal input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual ma=\r\nster, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determi=\r\nne one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjun=\r\na was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guru=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who cl=\r\narified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was c=\r\nonfused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the w=\r\norld and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mat=\r\nerial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, wh=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one c=\r\nan err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) can=\r\nnot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma.=\r\n No, dharma changes from person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time =\r\nto time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s under=\r\nstanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purit=\r\ny. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, jap=\r\nam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one ca=\r\nn slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist s=\r\no long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;baner=\r\njeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I =\r\nagree with Dinesh.

He follows up for the money b=\r\nut with the attitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although he shows to his fami=\r\nly and friends that he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned and it was foolish =\r\nact etc... But in his mind he thinks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it was a rina from some=\r\n past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were Money of=\r\n Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she =\r\nwill do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthen they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Creat=\r\ne New Rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be able to break free from this particular c=\r\nhain. He may have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself ve=\r\nry strongly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Money and its ownership and hence all the action=\r\ns done due to that, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He may have created NEW RINAS which will b=\r\ne needed to settled on a later\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; date.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However I am not sure for what I have w=\r\nritten.

Alternatively, you =\r\ncan also try to get him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the book and call him to re=\r\nad the book along with you. In the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning, he may still distra=\r\nct you and make it more difficult to read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, it is possible th=\r\nat he also likes the book and starts enjoying the book\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along with=\r\n you and stops distracting you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If meditation is like reading a book, weak=\r\nness for sex is like the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend and sexual thoughts that arise in=\r\n the mind are like the distractions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caused by the friend, then ag=\r\nhora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend to read the=\r\n book along with you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, as I said, there are no guarantees.

The idea is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and app=\r\nreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars t=\r\nhat the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and=\r\n overcome various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. R=\r\neciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will promote the fightin=\r\ng spirit within one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There is nothi=\r\nng wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight/overcome it =\r\nat the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One as=\r\npect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. On=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one =\r\nrealizes Self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one fin=\r\nally sees that all these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are aspects of a Single Mother who is al=\r\nso essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83?=\r\n =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Agh=\r\nora series books by Dr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha. For =\r\nnow I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora =\r\nis not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora =\r\nmeans &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A=\r\n true=C3=83? Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or=\r\n bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone d=\r\nies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying th=\r\ne dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nis true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lo=\r\nrd is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we remind ourselves o=\r\nf this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone praise=\r\ns us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are about t=\r\no feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya=\r\n hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. =\r\nOnly the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusi=\r\nons&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to g=\r\net it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are tempor=\r\nary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on t=\r\nemporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuse=\r\ns are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind no=\r\nt dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;R=\r\naama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *impermanent ma=\r\nnifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifyi=\r\nng them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about t=\r\nhem with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;al=\r\nl is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pur=\r\nsues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illu=\r\nsions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nquestions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=83? But, please remember that eating feces is =\r\nnot the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed an=\r\nd not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fru=\r\nit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgus=\r\nt serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the =\r\nimpermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A su=\r\nccessful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwe=\r\nlling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Se=\r\nlf and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the sam=\r\ne notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, which =\r\nessentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheles=\r\ns, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be fully absorbed=\r\n in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imperma=\r\nnant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling the=\r\nmselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into every=\r\n thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme=\r\n situation where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. T=\r\nhat can in fact work as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend =\r\nduality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sa=\r\nys &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nnicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even n=\r\not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal?=\r\n On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwell=\r\ns on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact=\r\n that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an=\r\n incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessar=\r\nily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. N=\r\not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83=\r\n? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. =\r\nSuppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts =\r\nin the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking o=\r\nne&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the m=\r\nind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for over=\r\ncoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and=\r\n distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is =\r\nno guarantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to =\r\nbite one after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some mi=\r\nnds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to=\r\n fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead=\r\n of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activities (one pure=\r\n and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one without such=\r\n distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits naked wit=\r\nh his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. I=\r\nn the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thi=\r\nnk that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something imp=\r\nure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mi=\r\nnd between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pic=\r\ntures physically or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex,=\r\n but evoke thoughts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation. Any small thoughts related to =\r\nsex that suddenly rise in the head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de=\r\nnser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts =\r\nrelating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they may now take=\r\n the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in medi=\r\ntation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the pe=\r\nrson&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Min=\r\nd has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\noughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine thos=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really.=\r\n It is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the person keeps on engaging in the pra=\r\nctice merely for sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks of sex everytime he sits for medi=\r\ntation (instead of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation everytime he sees naked=\r\n partner), if one was not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ready to start with.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
