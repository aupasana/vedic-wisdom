He uploaded it to Google Video and YouTube today. What is in Google Video is one file that is 20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in size). It is downloadable to your computer and you can play it using free software QuickTime. On YouTube, it is stored as three parts and has a higher quality. You can play those three parts directly from YouTube.\n \nIf you go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to Maha Ganapathi Homam page, you will see all related links right there.\n \nTo limit the video size, we made everything bare minimum. The veda mantra and beeja mantra are chanted 8 times each and Atharva seersham once. You can of course use higher counts and do it longer.\n \nThanks to Ravi for his effort!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n\n"}}
