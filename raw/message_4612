For she is the mighty and w=\r\nise One who opens us to supramental infinities and the cosmic vastness, to =\r\nthe grandeur of the supreme Light, to a treasure-house of miraculous knowle=\r\ndge, to the measureless movement of the Mother&#39;s eternal forces.\n\nNothing c=\r\nan move her because all wisdom is in her; nothing is hidden from her that s=\r\nhe chooses to know; she comprehends all things and all beings and their nat=\r\nure and what moves them and the law of the world and its times and how all =\r\nwas and is and must be.A strength is in her that meets everything and maste=\r\nrs and none can prevail in the end against her vast intangible wisdom and h=\r\nigh tranquil power. Equal, patient, unalterable in her will she deals with =\r\nmen according to their nature and with things and happenings according to t=\r\nheir Force and truth that is in them. Partiality she has none, but she foll=\r\nows the decrees of the Supreme and some she raises up and some she casts do=\r\nwn or puts away into the darkness.\n\nTo the wise she gives a greater and mor=\r\ne luminous wisdom; those that have vision she admits to her counsels; on th=\r\ne hostile she imposes the consequence of their hostility; the ignorant and =\r\nfoolish she leads them according to their blindness. In each man she answer=\r\ns and handles the different elements of his nature according to their need =\r\nand their urge and the return they call for, puts on them the required pres=\r\nsure or leaves them to their cherished liberty to prosper in the ways of th=\r\ne Ignorance and perish.\n\nFor she is above all, bound by nothing, attached t=\r\no nothing in the universe. Yet she has more than any other the heart of the=\r\n universal Mother. For her compassion is endless and inexhaustible; all are=\r\n to her eyes her children and portions of the One, even the Asura and Raksh=\r\nasa and Pisacha and those that are revolted and hostile. Even her rejection=\r\ns are only a postponement, even her punishments are a grace.\n\nBut her compa=\r\nssion does not blind her wisdom or turn her action from the course decreed;=\r\n for the Truth of things is her one concern, knowledge her centre of power =\r\nand to build our soul and our nature into the divine Truth her mission and =\r\nher labour.\n\nMahakali is of another nature.\n\nNot of wideness but of height,=\r\n not wisdom but force and strength are her peculiar power. There is in her =\r\na overwhelming intensity, a mighty passion of force to achieve, a divine vi=\r\nolence rushing to shatter every limit and obstacle. All her divinity leaps =\r\nout in a splendour of tempestuous action; she is therefore swiftness, for t=\r\nhe immediately effective process, the rapid and direct stroke, the frontal =\r\nassault that carries everything, before it.\n\nTerrible is her face to the As=\r\nura, dangerous and ruthless her mood against the haters of the Divine; for =\r\nshe is the Warrior of the Worlds who never shrinks from the battle. Intoler=\r\nant of imperfection, she deals roughly with all in man that is unwilling an=\r\nd she is severe to all that is obstinately ignorant and obscure; her wrath =\r\nis immediate and dire against treachery and falsehood and malignity, ill-wi=\r\nll is smitten at once by her scourage.\n\nIndifference, negligence and sloth =\r\nin the divine work she cannot bear and she smites awake at once with sharp =\r\npain, if need be, the untimely slumberer and the loiterer. The impulses tha=\r\nt are swift and straight and frank, the movements that are unreserved and a=\r\nbsolute, the aspiration that mounts in flame are the motion of Mahakali.\n\nH=\r\ner spirit is tameless, her vision and will are high and far-reaching like t=\r\nhe flight of an eagle, her feet are rapid on the upward way and her hands a=\r\nre outstretched to strike and to succour. For she too is the Mother and her=\r\n love is as intense as her wrath and she has a deep and passionate kindness=\r\n. \n\nWhen she is allowed to intervene in her strength, then in one moment ar=\r\ne broken like things without consistence the obstacles that immobilise or t=\r\nhe enemies that assail the seeker.\n\nIf her anger is dreadful to the hostile=\r\n and the vehemence of her pressure painful to the weak and timid, she is lo=\r\nved and worshipped by the great, the strong and the noble; for they feel th=\r\nat her blows beat what is rebellious in their material into strength and pe=\r\nrfect truth, hammer straight what is wry and perverse and expel what is imp=\r\nure or defective.\n\nBut for her what is done in a day might have taken centu=\r\nries; without her Ananda might be wide and grave or soft and sweet and beau=\r\ntiful but would lose the flaming joy of its most absolute intensities. \n\nTo=\r\n knowledge she gives a conquering might, brings to beauty and harmony a hig=\r\nh and mounting movement and imparts to the slow and difficult labour after =\r\nperfection an impetus that multiplies the power and shortens the long way. =\r\nNothing can satisfy her that falls short of the supreme ecstasies, the high=\r\nest heights, the noblest aims, the largest vistas.\n\nTherefore with her is t=\r\nhe victorious force of the Divine and it is by grace of her fire and passio=\r\nn and speed that great achievements can be done now than hereafter.&quot;\n\n-Rega=\r\nrds\n Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
