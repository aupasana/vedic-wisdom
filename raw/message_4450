Is there any =\r\nharm if a person does carry on with his regular worship/puja/ japa/homa dur=\r\ning this period of mourning? \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Bhyan=\r\nkari Maharoudri Mahabhyavinashini&quot;\n\n--- On Thu, 10/6/10, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\nSubj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Upanayanam questions\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com\nCc: &quot;Sunitha&quot; &lt;sunitha_macherla@ yahoo.com&gt;\nDate: Thursday, 10 June, 2=\r\n010, 6:33 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nNamaste,\n\nPriests offer samidhas (twigs) symbolizin=\r\ng different samskaras. There is nothing wrong in offering dry coconut piece=\r\ns instead.\n\nThe most important part of upanayanam is the brahmopadesa, i.e.=\r\n teaching of the Gayatri mantra. All other things are secondary. For exampl=\r\ne, many priests re-enact all the rituals that were supposed to be done sinc=\r\ne birth (e.g. naming, first feeding, first shaving etc), just in case those=\r\n samskaras were skipped earlier. One can wonder if that is really necessary=\r\n and whether it has any real impact on one&#39;s spiritual evolution.\n\nThere is=\r\n also a lot of fake drama enacted. The young person and his father repeat t=\r\nhings in Sanskrit that are told by the priest. Those who know Sanskrit will=\r\n see that the young man says he is going to go to Kashi and learn Veda etc.=\r\n He says he will live by begging alms from now on. He even practices it by =\r\nasking all attendees for alms. There is a lot of entertaining drama. Of cou=\r\nrse, most boys getting upanayanam do not really intend to leave parents, go=\r\n to Kashi to learn Veda and do not really plan to live by begging! A lot of=\r\n things they say are simply lies, done just for fun and to enact a drama ba=\r\nsed on how things could have been in old days!\n\n* * *\n\nPut bluntly, being g=\r\niven a mantra by a guru is essentially a spiritual event and not a social e=\r\nvent or a party, though upanayanam has transformed from a spiritual event i=\r\nnto a social event. All you really need is the young man and his guru sitti=\r\nng in one place and the mantra being taught. You don&#39;t need a big crowd.\n\nO=\r\nf course, one may say that a big crowd is needed to come and give blessings=\r\n, but &quot;blessings&quot; are a misunderstood and overrated concept. For someone to=\r\n give you blessings that do some good to you, the person should have someth=\r\ning in his karmik account and the ability to transfer it to you. Most of th=\r\ne times, blessings given by people in our society are a mere formality and =\r\nmean nothing, like checks that have &quot;void - this is not a real check&quot; print=\r\ned on them.\n\nInstead of hundred people with various levels of interest in t=\r\nhe goings on visiting the function out of social compulsion and watching po=\r\nssibly with boredom, an ideal setup for an upanayanam is just the sishya an=\r\nd guru and some sadhakas related to them who have done sadhana and wish the=\r\n young man well.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you ask me, the most important thing is this. T=\r\nhe person who is transmitting the Gayatri mantra (usually father) should in=\r\ntensify his spiritual sadhana, especially with Gayatri mantra, in the month=\r\ns before upanayanam. If possible, keep brahmacharya for a few months and ch=\r\nant Gayatri mantra for an hour or two everyday. During that time, he should=\r\n never say Gayatri mantra out loud.\n\nWhen he transmits the mantra, he shoul=\r\nd ensure that only the young man hears it and nobody else does (i.e. no dil=\r\nution in the transmitted energy). The custom is to say it in the ear while =\r\na cloth covers both, but that only *symbolizes* secretiveness and may not r=\r\neally *ensure* secretiveness. If everybody (especially the priest) is sitti=\r\nng close to them, they may also hear it in spite of a the cloth covering th=\r\nem.\n\nWhen I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rituals in open air in our=\r\n back yard. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I took my son inside the p=\r\nooja room where I did my sadhana. I did not allow anybody, including the pr=\r\niests, to come there. I taught the mantra to my son in an low, but audible,=\r\n voice. I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a few times, ensured his=\r\n pronunciation was correct, and then both of us did a maalaa (108 times med=\r\nitation) with it silently. We then came back to the backyard and the ritual=\r\ns continued.\n\nOne more thing on muhurta: If you got a muhurta from an astro=\r\nloger you trust and want to follow it, please ensure that Gayatri mantra is=\r\n taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Some priests put a paste m=\r\nade of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man&#39;s head at the muhurta time.=\r\n That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thing.\n\n* * *\n\nThough we d=\r\nid a detailed ritual for my son&#39;s upanayanam, my own upanayanam was a very =\r\nsimple affair. Though my father is an orthodox braahmana following a very s=\r\nimple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthodox in the matter of rituals. Abo=\r\nve all, he fearlessly follows his convictions and does not engage in ritual=\r\ns that he does not consider meaningful. He is also against following the le=\r\ntter of the rules and breaking the spirit. For example, when he went to a g=\r\nriha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, they were beating a cow to force=\r\n it to climb stairs to enter the room. People bring a cow into the room at =\r\nthe time of housewarming, as they consider a cow to symbolize Lakshmi and s=\r\nome steps in the ritual require a cow in the room. As the cow was not happy=\r\n to climb stairs, they resorted to violence to force it. My father was sad =\r\nto see the suffering of the cow and told them bluntly that they were doing =\r\nadharma and there was no point in getting a cow in the\n room like that. But=\r\n my father puts more value on the spirit of the rules rather than the lette=\r\nr and does not hesitate to speak his mind in front of anybody.\n\nFor my upan=\r\nayanam, he took me to Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirupati/Tirumala, which =\r\nis his favorite temple. At the time of muhurta, we were on the hill near th=\r\ne temple. He spent a few hours doing his japam with various stotras and I a=\r\nlso did japam with several stotras. When the muhurta came, he simply taught=\r\n me Gayatri mantra and that was it. No rituals of any kind were performed, =\r\nexcept for japam for a few hours.\n\nIn my opinion, such a simple approach is=\r\n also perfectly fine. The key points are that the person giving mantra shou=\r\nld have done some sadhana, both of them should be in a good and relaxed moo=\r\nd at the time and environment should be peaceful, and, the person receiving=\r\n mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it later on.\n\nIf a businessman open=\r\ns an account in his son&#39;s name for a new business venture by the young man,=\r\n what matters is how much money father gave and how well the son used the m=\r\noney, how he ran the new business and how he grew the money. How big a part=\r\ny was held, how many people came and what activities they engaged in is irr=\r\nelevant in the long run.\n\n* * *\n\nMy purpose is not to discourage elaborate =\r\nrituals. Do them if there is social pressure to do so or you find them inte=\r\nresting. But, atleast ensure that mantropadesa happens peacefully and corre=\r\nctly. More importantly, ensure that the young man does some sadhana with Ga=\r\nyatri mantra everyday, after upanayanam.\n\nAlso, it is perfectly acceptable =\r\n(and beneficial) to initiate the young person into homam after upanayanam i=\r\ns done. On the same day or a few days later, one can teach a simple version=\r\n of Ganapathi homam and let the young person perform it by oneself during w=\r\neekends or so. One can start off with the super-short procedure and slowly =\r\nadd things. Doing Gayatri mantra everyday and homam now and then will accel=\r\nerate the spiritual evolution of the young person.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha=\r\n\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -\n\n---- Sunitha &lt;sunitha_macherla@ yahoo.com&gt; wrot=\r\ne: \n&gt; Namaskaram Narasimha garu, Can the homam performed during upanayanam =\r\nbe done using only coconuts and nuts?

We then came back to the backyard =\r\nand the rituals continued.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One more thing on muhurta: If you got a m=\r\nuhurta from an astrologer you trust and want to follow it, please ensure th=\r\nat\n Gayatri mantra is taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Some =\r\npriests put a paste made of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man&#39;s head=\r\n at the muhurta time. That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thing=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though we did a detailed ritual for my son&#39;s upanayan=\r\nam, my own upanayanam was a very simple affair. Though my father is an orth=\r\nodox braahmana following a very simple and austere lifestyle, he is unortho=\r\ndox in the matter of rituals. Above all, he fearlessly follows his convicti=\r\nons and does not engage in rituals that he does not consider meaningful. He=\r\n is also against following the letter of the rules and breaking the spirit.=\r\n For example, when he went to a griha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once,=\r\n they were beating a cow to force it to climb stairs to enter the room. Peo=\r\nple bring a cow into the room at the time of housewarming, as they consider=\r\n a cow to symbolize Lakshmi and some steps in the ritual require a cow\n in =\r\nthe room. As the cow was not happy to climb stairs, they resorted to violen=\r\nce to force it. My father was sad to see the suffering of the cow and told =\r\nthem bluntly that they were doing adharma and there was no point in getting=\r\n a cow in the room like that. But my father puts more value on the spirit o=\r\nf the rules rather than the letter and does not hesitate to speak his mind =\r\nin front of anybody.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For my upanayanam, he took me to Lord Venkatesw=\r\nara temple in Tirupati/Tirumala, which is his favorite temple. At the time =\r\nof muhurta, we were on the hill near the temple. He spent a few hours doing=\r\n his japam with various stotras and I also did japam with several stotras. =\r\nWhen the muhurta came, he simply taught me Gayatri mantra and that was it. =\r\nNo rituals of any kind were performed, except for japam for a few hours.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In my opinion, such a simple approach is also perfectly fine. The key =\r\npoints are that the person giving mantra should have done some\n sadhana, bo=\r\nth of them should be in a good and relaxed mood at the time and environment=\r\n should be peaceful, and, the person receiving mantra should do a lot of sa=\r\ndhana with it later on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If a businessman opens an account in his son=\r\n&#39;s name for a new business venture by the young man, what matters is how mu=\r\nch money father gave and how well the son used the money, how he ran the ne=\r\nw business and how he grew the money. How big a party was held, how many pe=\r\nople came and what activities they engaged in is irrelevant in the long run=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My purpose is not to discourage elaborate rituals. Do=\r\n them if there is social pressure to do so or you find them interesting. Bu=\r\nt, atleast ensure that mantropadesa happens peacefully and correctly. More =\r\nimportantly, ensure that the young man does some sadhana with Gayatri mantr=\r\na everyday, after upanayanam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, it is perfectly acceptable (and =\r\nbeneficial) to initiate the young person into homam\n after upanayanam is do=\r\nne. On the same day or a few days later, one can teach a simple version of =\r\nGanapathi homam and let the young person perform it by oneself during weeke=\r\nnds or so. One can start off with the super-short procedure and slowly add =\r\nthings. Doing Gayatri mantra everyday and homam now and then will accelerat=\r\ne the spiritual evolution of the young person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Nara=\r\nsimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nsaraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.=\r\norg&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/\n group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- Sunitha &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.y=\r\nahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dsunitha_macherla%40yahoo.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;sunitha_macherla@ yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaskaram N=\r\narasimha garu, Can the homam performed during upanayanam be done using only=\r\n coconuts and nuts?
