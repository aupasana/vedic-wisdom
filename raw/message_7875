The second one is less popular, but is quite\ninteresti=\r\nng. It retells many popular stories from the ramayana,\nmahabharata etc and =\r\nadds or magnifies ganesha&#39;s role. For example, the\nstory of the slaying of =\r\nmadhu and kaitabha from the devi mahatmyam is\nretold, but here, ganesha is =\r\nthe hero. Upon being awakened, vishnu has\nto pray to ganesha, and with his =\r\nblessing gets the necessary strength\nto slay the demons.\n\nHindi tranlsation=\r\ns of both puranas are probably available through\nchaukamba publications.\n\ns=\r\nasneham,\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 9:15 AM, Jitender Dahiya=\r\n\n&lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste to all,\n&gt;\n&gt; Can somebody tell m=\r\ne another good book to read for Mahaganpati.\n&gt; Actually everywhere i hear o=\r\nnly about Aghora books.\n&gt; I agree they are awesome but for when we are doin=\r\ng sadhna for any deity other than Maa Samshan Tara or Chandi then, after re=\r\nading aghora trilogy a misunderstanding comes to my mind that only those tw=\r\no are real or the most powerful.\n&gt;\n&gt; So can some one please guide me to som=\r\ne other book which gives explanation on &quot;Mahaganpati&quot; aspect of GOD.\n&gt;\n&gt; Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; Jitender\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Sha=\r\nantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
