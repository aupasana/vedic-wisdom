Swamiji may have been trying to in=\r\nspire \nsome sadhakas into the sannyasa order when he wrote this series and =\r\nhe \ngoes a bit overboard.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; all members of your famil=\r\ny will cling to you like leeches\n&gt; till the end of your life\n\nI do not appr=\r\neciate this tone at all. One can renounce if one wants. \nBut, why belittle =\r\nfamily members and call them leeches?\n\nIf one&#39;s wife wants to cling to one,=\r\n because of her conditioning and \nspiritual evolution, it is fine. She is n=\r\not necessarily a bad person or \na &quot;leech&quot;. If one engages in dharmik and un=\r\nselfish actions to make one&#39;s \nwife happy in various ways, as far as possib=\r\nle, it is not bad and does \nnot imply an undesirable attachment. If one *ex=\r\npects* something from \nwife in return, THAT expectation is bad. THAT expect=\r\nation of something \nback from wife is a leech that sucks blood from one&#39;s s=\r\noul.\n\nSeeing the world, people and objects as obstructions or temptations o=\r\nr \n&quot;leeches&quot; is silly. Being disgusted with the world is as much an \nattach=\r\nment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated with it! World \nand peo=\r\nple can exist and act in ways that may be natural to them. \nWhatever they d=\r\no, they are never the problem or blockage for your own \nspiritual evolution=\r\n. You may do various actions and give various things \nto various people, ba=\r\nsed on kaarmik debts, and nothing you do is \nnecessarily a bondage. Actions=\r\n never bind you, it is expectation of \nspecific results from those actions =\r\nthat binds you. Give freely and \nmagnanimously; and take whatever comes bac=\r\nk naturally, with no \nexcitement and no regret. Remove ANY expectation that=\r\n may exist in your \nmind, from ANYONE, and become completely free. THAT is =\r\ntrue sannyasa or \nrenunciation, not seeing people as leeches that cling on =\r\nto you.\n\nIf one becomes a sannyasin because one is fed up with the world, i=\r\nt is \nprobably a bad idea. When one discharges most of one&#39;s duties and \nre=\r\nsponsibilities to others, a sense of genuine renunciation will \nnaturally d=\r\nevelop. If one runs away from the world prematurely, Nature \nwill drag one =\r\nback later.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen Adi Shankara renounced, his mother w=\r\nas very sad. But Adi Shankara \ndid not see her as a leech. In fact, when sh=\r\ne was on deathbed, he came \nall the way back and did her final rites himsel=\r\nf, though that was \ncompletely against the traditional notions of sannyasa =\r\ndharma. There is \na big lesson in this.\n\nActions and paying off your debts =\r\ndo not bind you. In fact, inaction and \npushing off a debt to future MAY bi=\r\nnd you! It is expectation in what you \ndo and egoistic attachment to what y=\r\nou do (feeling proud or ashamed) is \nwhat binds you.\n\n*        *        *\n\n=\r\n&gt; It is only when you take sannyasa that they will leave\n&gt; you free.\n\nEven =\r\nto a sannyasin, many people may cling. They may come for knowledge \nor wisd=\r\nom or to fulfil their pride related to doing good religious work. \nSo many =\r\npeople clung to Vivekananda and other monastic disciples of \nRamakrishna. I=\r\nf one expects something back from such followers, \nwell-wishers and discipl=\r\nes (e.g. admiration, learning well, spreading \nknowledge or message in the =\r\nworld, giving money for the religious order, \netc), there is no difference =\r\nreally between wife and children and them. \nIn other words, attachment can =\r\nform and bind you.\n\nWhat binds you is your attitude towards people and your=\r\n expectations \nfrom people and NOT how much people like you and how attache=\r\nd THEY are \nto you. To be free, you do not need people to &quot;leave you free&quot;.=\r\n You can \nbe surrounded by thousands of people who are attached to you heav=\r\nily and \nyet you can be free. Their attachment binds *them*. To be free, ha=\r\nve no \nattachment and no expectations. Give other whatever your body, mind =\r\nand \nsoul allow you to give. Have no expctations of getting anythying back.=\r\n \nTake whatever comes back by itself. Simple!\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; When =\r\nyou fall sick You will be tempted to go in for their help and \n&gt; vice versa=\r\n.\n\n&quot;Vice versa&quot; is not a problem. Taking care of a sick person if one is \na=\r\nble to, whether it is wife or parents or children or someone else, is \nnot =\r\nbinding. If there is an expectation of a return favor, THEN it is \nbinding.=\r\n\n\nRegarding taking help: Expecting anything from anyone causes bondage, \nbu=\r\nt taking what comes by itself, with neither excitement nor regret, \ndoes no=\r\nt cause bondage. Ma Sarada nicely demonstrated this once.\n\nWhen Swami Yogan=\r\nanda was badly sick, Ma Sarada asked his erstwhile wife \n(before sannyasa!)=\r\n to come and serve him. That is so unconventional! \nSwami Yogananda protest=\r\ned saying it will set a bad example. But Swami \nYogananda did not have any =\r\nexpectations and this was done voluntarily by \nhis wife (or under the instr=\r\nuction of Ma sarada, but not due to any \nexpectations or pressure from Yoga=\r\nnanda). After Yogananda overcame his \nreservations, he was neither excited =\r\nnor regretful. He accepted the \nservice equanomously and not worrying about=\r\n what others will think or \nsay.\n\nIn fact, if one puts pressure on oneself =\r\nand wants to prove to the world \nhow good one&#39;s renunciation us, THAT may b=\r\ne an attachment. &quot;Expecting&quot; \nthe world to see one&#39;s renunciation and appre=\r\nciate one (or not criticize \none) is a very subtle attachment. Ma Sarada ma=\r\ny have detected a subtle \nattachment and put Swami Yogananda in a spot inte=\r\nntionally and made him \novercome the attachment. Great teachers like Ramakr=\r\nishna and Ma Sarada \nteach subtle and valuable lessons in a practical way. =\r\nIt may not even be \nobvious to onlookers that there was a lesson there! Thi=\r\ns is how sadgurus \noperate..\n\n*        *        *\n\nBeing able to renounce w=\r\nife, children, parents, siblings, house, car etc \nis a great thing. But, if=\r\n one thinks that those are &quot;all connections and \nties&quot; that bind one, one i=\r\ns badly mistaken. Those are the gross ones - \nthe external ones. The bigges=\r\nt bondage is internal. The identification \nwith a body and identification w=\r\nith a subtle individual identity (e.g. \nthe notion that one is Narasimha, a=\r\nn engineer, a scholar, an astrologer \netc) are much stronger bondages than =\r\nany others.\n\nIf one&#39;s hands or legs are cut off or if a tiger is eating one=\r\n alive or \nif one is suffering from a terrible disease, can one focus the m=\r\nind on \ngod and not think of the body and its suffering? If one thinks &quot;*I*=\r\n am \nsuffering&quot; and starts weeping, is one really free?\n\nIf someone praises=\r\n a sannyasin for his renunciation, devotion to god, \nwisdom or spiritual at=\r\ntainment, will no sannyasin feel even a little \npride? If so, is one really=\r\n free?\n\nIf a sannayasin does sadhana and experiences some special things or=\r\n gets \nsome siddhis, will it not give a little bit of pride or satisfaction=\r\n? If \nso, is one really free?\n\nFocusing so heavily on external renunciation=\r\n and making external objects \nof attachment seem like a major thing, while =\r\nignoring the real \nattachment inside one (the sense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;the=\r\nse are mine&quot;), \nis like beating up a tiger cub and feeling proud of the ach=\r\nievement, \nwhile ignoring the big tiget just lurking behind one and waiting=\r\n to \npounce on one!\n\n*        *        *\n\nLet me say one thing clearly. San=\r\nnyasa or external renunciation is an \n*attempt* to cut oneself off from a f=\r\new external objects that cause \ntemptation (and bondage!) internally. It is=\r\n not a guarantee that \ninternal temptations and bondages are completely des=\r\ntroyed. The real \nbondage comes from the internal attachment and not from t=\r\nhe external \nobjects. Work hard on removing it. Do not despise the external=\r\n objects \nor see them as &quot;leeches&quot; or become fed up with them.\n\nBest regard=\r\ns,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do=\r\n It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n           =\r\n        http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n\nOn Fri, Jun 3, 2011 at 2:00 PM,=\r\n chaudhuri.krishnendu wrote:\n\n    Sannyasa has got its own glory and advant=\r\nages!
