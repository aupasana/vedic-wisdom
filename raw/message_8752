What inspires me is a Ramakrish=\r\nna where all philosophies merge without facing unjustified Rejection and in=\r\n whose teachings, all the philosophies get their rightful and deserving app=\r\nreciation.\nwhen people start repeating like a parrot, THAT half verse of Sh=\r\nankara and say &quot;Brahman Satya Jaganmithya&quot; , The pseudo Vedanta develops wi=\r\nth utterly foolish ideas. however, when a person like Swami Vivekananda cor=\r\nrectly understands what was meant by Adi Shankara and such few real greats =\r\nof Vedanta, can rightly explain its usefulness to the world and what become=\r\ns very palatable to us as practical vedanta. This is not to start discussin=\r\ng pros and cons of various philosophies, but to make it a point that philos=\r\nophies of a Shankara or a Madhavacharya or a Vallabhacharya or anybody else=\r\n can be rejected purely on the ground of unattrectiveness, un-inspiring, un=\r\npalatable, going over the top and such reasons but the attitude to reject t=\r\nhem as a false or mistaken must be avoided and I DO NOT SAY THAT YOU CARRY =\r\nSUCH ATTITUDE. I AM SURE YOU DO NOT.\nEspecially i would single out philospo=\r\nhy of Adi Shankara because as i said earlier, that in intellectual debates,=\r\n the same philosophy proved to be victorious and that is on records. It was=\r\n not a pure spirituality, It was Philosophy which was debated then. This is=\r\n probably the only recorded example in History where in a Spiritual philoso=\r\nphy was debated in a vast region and accepted by all peers.\nI am not trying=\r\n to hard sale Adi Shankara here. who am I? just to put some thoughts as the=\r\ny are coming to me.    \n\n***\nI wrote a big message by my standards :) and s=\r\ntill feel that there are so many thoughts i could not write and even the on=\r\ne which I wrote, it could have written much better.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n =\r\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; It may require a LOT to reject ph=\r\nilosophy of giant such as adi Shankara and yet some one may not be able to =\r\nreject afterall. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Philosophy is pure rational thought.

Vibhuti of God). I am also sure that the very pre=\r\nsence of such a man of such spiritual stature would have naturally drawn ma=\r\nsses towards him.=C2=A0 It happens with all great personalities. They have =\r\na magnetism which extends way beyond after their death.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, to un=\r\nderstand, appreciate, criticize, debate, analyses, comparatively-evaluate a=\r\nny philosophy of any individual is not that difficult and is a valid ration=\r\nal process. \n&gt; \n&gt; While future is always uncertain, but chances look remote=\r\n for me that I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sri Adi Shankara=\r\n&#39;s Mayavada - as is understood and propagated by his followers - which I ha=\r\nd studied when I was first trying to get a grasp of Hindu philosophy. It a =\r\nnice, compact and easily understandable philosophy. Possibly one the chief =\r\nreasons why most=C2=A0 intellectuals like his Adwaitha apart from being att=\r\nracted by his personality. It is easier to debate from Sri Shankara&#39;s stand=\r\n-point. At that time I liked it. Later as I got acquainted myself with more=\r\n varieties of Hindu philosophy, I found others more comprehensive and cover=\r\ning more essential points and using a very, if I may use this phrase, a bot=\r\ntom-up approach to understanding reality, while Sri Shankara&#39;s philosophy i=\r\ns a very top-down approach, with a greater thrust on the top and an indeter=\r\nminate leftover in the bottom. Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, Ramanujacharya&#39;s Visist=\r\nha-adwaitha,\n&gt;  Vallavacharya&#39;s Suddha Adwaitha - so many varieties of phil=\r\nosophy.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a personal view about judging philosophy. For everythin=\r\ng that one giant has said, there is always another one who has said exactly=\r\n the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a different view-=\r\npoint, differing with all the previous ones. And each of these giants have =\r\nspoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations of truths. So p=\r\nersonality and stature of the philosopher should play no role in an objecti=\r\nve analysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and stature of a m=\r\nathematician is of no use in=C2=A0 judging the correctness of a mathematica=\r\nl theory.=C2=A0 Spiritually, the reality is same (and it maybe a very compl=\r\nex reality). But philosophically each have differences which cannot the ign=\r\nored. In such an intellectual climate, in my personal opinion, it is fair e=\r\nnough to discard one philosophy for another, after a thorough and detailed =\r\ncontemplation of the pros and cons.\n&gt; \n&gt; From a spiritual view-point all th=\r\nis is utterly meaningless. Which ever spiritual giant one chooses to hang o=\r\nn to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort is engaged, surely progress wi=\r\nll happen in time. But philosophy is a another matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; [To make my sta=\r\nnd clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some strange miracle of Go=\r\nd, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me, I would have no q=\r\nualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him and asking for his b=\r\nlessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable.

Nobody,=\r\n can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She is truly the One whos=\r\ne energy has created the Universe of diversity, She lies hidden inside it a=\r\ns well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discovered, extending Her lov=\r\ne, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who calls Her sincerely and =\r\nunconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liberty to act as per its =\r\nown understanding, for causes apparently good or the apparently bad. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Does=C3=82=C2=A0She needs some visa \n&gt; &gt; to go there if she is=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0not the Creater.=C3=82=C2=A0As you say all higher deity are \n&gt; &gt; ther=\r\ne but less in ability.

Everything is Her world, =\r\nthen why is there ugliness, crime, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if =\r\nnot She? And it is She herself who gave them the liberty to act as per thei=\r\nr freewill. This world is a play of forces and a democracy of opportunities=\r\n. Every impulse, however Divine or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to=\r\n run its course and actualize itself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Co=\r\nmpassion! That is why She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Grea=\r\nt Gods as much to the Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pre=\r\ntas and other corrupt human being and what not. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now coming to you=\r\nr question on the phrase &quot;higher deities having less ability&quot;. I think I ha=\r\nve not been able to explain clearly, since in the last mail I was merely wr=\r\niting in the context of that discussion. Let me try here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There ar=\r\ne three basic layer of this Universe. The physical, the astral or subtle la=\r\nyer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, which lies =\r\nsuperimposed on our own physical plane, there is a whole wide world of all =\r\npossible forces, just like in our own world. It is a layer which is created=\r\n out of force of pranashakti. This force of pranashakti in humans beings is=\r\n what causes all emotive movements on the consciousness - joy, happiness, l=\r\nove, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachments etc etc=\r\n. These are also capable of influencing the thinking mind is us. Now the co=\r\nre philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik sadhana, is to create a form=\r\nation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated =\r\nrituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you think carefully, you will re=\r\nalize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual bef=\r\nore starting. The sadhaka used the force of his/her own\n&gt; &gt;  pranashakti to=\r\n infuse life into a subtle formation of the deity. Once this process is suc=\r\ncessfully done, this sublte formation of the deity which exists in the subt=\r\nle plane, has a life of its own. It can then guide the sadhaka through the =\r\npath and eventually, one day lead him/her to the real abode of the deity wh=\r\nich is the karana-jagat (beyond this astral plane). If a person is able to =\r\nawaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and make it identify/create such an astral=\r\n formation of the deity, it becomes an even more powerful force. It is, fro=\r\nm our limited human perspective, as much a powerful entity as we may imagin=\r\ne, yet it is often not the actual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has bee=\r\nn described by Sri Vimalananda in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When a sadhaka has been able to associate with such =\r\nan astral formation of the deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path p=\r\nrovided the sadhaka also is trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the =\r\ncausal planes (the real spiritual planes of existence where the real force =\r\nof the Deity originates). The difference, if you ask, between this astral f=\r\normation of the deity and the real deity is that, the former is neither bou=\r\nnd nor capable by itself of causing a complete and total transformation of =\r\nthe average human nature without a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, =\r\nif one reaches the plane of the Great Gods, which is where the real deity e=\r\nxists, one cannot avoid being transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And =\r\nwhat kind of a transformation will it be? One that will reflect to the worl=\r\nd as a greater and genuine humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine =\r\nat ALL time and unfailingly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man -=\r\n lust, anger,\n&gt; &gt;  jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, =\r\ndetachment, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the cons=\r\nciousness. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to anothe=\r\nr person, will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which will au=\r\ntomatically calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. TH=\r\nAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the grea=\r\nt deities. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the causal =\r\nplanes of existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which is c=\r\nreated by the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, =\r\nis often not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformation in a =\r\nsadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can&#39;t=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 get me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or b=\r\nring me fame or any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral fo=\r\nrmations of the\n&gt;  deities\n&gt; &gt;  can very easily do all these things in the =\r\nphysical world - but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the=\r\n must authentic and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one a=\r\nim and destination of all genuine sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since this astral plane=\r\n is the way it is, therefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep actively work=\r\ning on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surr=\r\nender (when that happens one accepts all life-situations without the slight=\r\nest grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is u=\r\nniversally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are a=\r\nffected at least to some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, on=\r\ne is simply not ready to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from th=\r\nem spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a =\r\ngap between experience and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lea=\r\nd to realization. One off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time =\r\nit fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioni=\r\nng of the sadhaka.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your \n&gt; &gt; theory. You h=\r\nave taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain \n&gt; &gt; person reach=\r\n a stage in their spiritual path, others think whatever this guy is utterin=\r\ng is=C3=82=C2=A0complete truth, when in fact it is=C3=82=C2=A0far from trut=\r\nh. \n&gt; &gt; Once=C3=82=C2=A0I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that Divine =\r\nLord who spoke \n&gt; &gt; Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I co=\r\nuld not believe \n&gt; &gt; what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went=\r\n down the drain.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You surety is incorrect. There were certain eve=\r\nnts which happened in the last one and half years which made me sit down an=\r\nd rethink my own understanding of spirituality. At about the same time I st=\r\narted worshiping a specific personality of the Divine Mother, and the more =\r\nI meditated on Her, the more would thoughts pour into my mind that my under=\r\nstanding of spirituality is imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, using=\r\n my own meditations to find out what was wrong or rather imperfectly unders=\r\ntood, what needed rethinking. First question I asked myself was, what is th=\r\ne aim of spirituality? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answers=\r\n and processes and truths. But it was still not exceptionally clear.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I had first read Sri Aurobindo when I was in college. I could not go bey=\r\nond the first two pages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Th=\r\nree years ago someone gave me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand s=\r\nay 10 percent, and rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due =\r\nto egoistic arrogance. Never opened any of his writing since then. This yea=\r\nr, as my sadhana was going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct =\r\nthe flaws in my understanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thou=\r\nght in the form of an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri =\r\nAurobindo but in a very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inn=\r\ner-eye, and thoroughly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book agai=\r\nn, and read it in the prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sens=\r\ne to me. What I was struggling to understand all this year, whose outline I=\r\n could grasp yet not get a proper hang of, I was able to understand\n&gt; &gt;  fr=\r\nom his writings with much deeper clarity.=C3=82=C2=A0 Many of my own experi=\r\nences made more sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply =\r\nsense in a new light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in m=\r\ne told me to stop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the res=\r\nt of the 60 % I will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise =\r\nthe rational mind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had=\r\n rejected firmly 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like=\r\n a blazing sun. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The line that you mention, is from one of the ear=\r\nlier writings of Sri Aurobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta.=\r\n In the Mahabharata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the g=\r\nreat war and when Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna a=\r\nsks Sri Krishna to repeat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the w=\r\nar (The Gita) once more since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, =\r\nthe time has passed away (it was a special time when the Gita was spoken), =\r\nhe cannot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; once again. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Krishna was th=\r\ne main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, for =\r\nduring the time when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda would appear before him daily and instruct him on the various layers of =\r\nthe mind, which he was not aware of till then. Swami Vivekananda had alread=\r\ny left his physical body by then. It was in the writings of Sri Aurobindo t=\r\nhat he mentioned about the left and right hemisphere of the brain and their=\r\n difference in functionality, and their connection to spirituality, about 3=\r\n0 years before medical science confirmed the same. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Right from get=\r\nting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry, to pushing his own spiritual =\r\nexperiences further into states of Sahaja (which he describes in different =\r\nterminology), etc etc, he was guided continuously by the Adesha of Sri Kris=\r\nhna. He would literally hear the voice of Krishna speaking to him, instruct=\r\ning him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, the Divine Mother beyo=\r\nnd all manifestation, was his destination. Anyway, my point is not to try a=\r\nnd sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of spirituality. I have benefited from =\r\nit, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefit. There are so ma=\r\nny sadgurus who have come to India, each with their unique perspectives and=\r\n ideas and philosophies. Each must individually try and find whose ideas ge=\r\nl properly with our mental and emotional makeup, and help us to progress on=\r\n the path. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though I now have a very deep respect for Sri Aurobind=\r\no, I maintain a safe distance from both his critics and his blind-admirers.=\r\n Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood the depth of his teachings=\r\n. Both their love and their hatred is a function of their own egos, like it=\r\n was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genuine understanding or apprec=\r\niation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be understood accurately or even sl=\r\nightly without sincere sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; Disclaimer---- My thin=\r\nking is \n&gt; &gt; very different due to Darshan and=C3=82=C2=A0Grace of Divine M=\r\nother & Divine \n&gt; &gt; Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or f=\r\nollow the \n&gt; &gt; leader.Thanks.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I at-least will never feel unhappy=\r\n if you disagree. There are \n&gt; &gt; many saints, many philosophies, many paths=\r\n, not everyone is bound to \n&gt; &gt; like every path.=C3=82=C2=A0 Disagreement i=\r\ns perfectly ok. Because someone \n&gt; &gt; disagrees with me or those whom I agre=\r\ne with, does not mean I like him \n&gt; &gt; any less. I try to keep my=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 emotional side (where respect, love, \n&gt; &gt; dislike, hatred, anger, passi=\r\nons exist) separate from my thinking mind. \n&gt; &gt; It is very much possible, t=\r\nhrough practice, for a man to disassociate \n&gt; &gt; his rational-mind from the =\r\nemotional-mind. So have no fears that your \n&gt; &gt; disagreement is going to ma=\r\nke me like you any less or any more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The problem with the emotiona=\r\nl part of our being is that it jumps up at appearances, running ahead to gr=\r\nasp the truth rather than waiting patiently for the truth to arrive in all =\r\nits aspects and dimensions, and in the process it distorts the truth and th=\r\nen reacts to that distorted image. For example, recently in some social for=\r\nums I posted a comment that I found the Tantrik Adwaitha far more appealing=\r\n than Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shankara has =\r\nmany hard-selling supporters. Immediately some friends of mine on Twitter a=\r\nnd otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion that I have disrespected Adi S=\r\nhankara, and tried best to make me &quot;see the truth&quot; by such grandiose statem=\r\nents that=C3=82=C2=A0 Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39; on Adwaitha and everythi=\r\nng else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denoun=\r\ncement. Both of which are million light-years away from the truth. That Sri=\r\n Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti\n&gt; &gt;  (manifestation) of God, that much =\r\nI am certain. His compositions are so brilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficient=\r\nly appreciated in words. Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his phi=\r\nlosophy. And because I am not bound to accept his philosophy, does not mean=\r\n I respect or love him any less than any other great saint.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; If you disrespect a man, and specially a saint, and then start dislik=\r\ning him too with a passion, you are creating strong negative karmas. But if=\r\n you can disagree with someone without losing respect or love for the perso=\r\nn, in an objective manner, you reap very little karmic effects. That is why=\r\n Lord Krishna too advices us to become more detached in life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In c=\r\nonclusion, Narasimha is totally correct. Many things cannot be sufficiently=\r\n expressed in words without causing some distortion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam =\r\nmanyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:=\r\n24]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;  From: Laxmi Narayan=\r\n &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai,\n&gt; &gt; How are you doing? About 200 hund=\r\nred years ago, a man made a theory of creation in France. When Napolean ask=\r\ned where is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. It makes things=\r\n complicated.\n&gt; &gt; So is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or Gra=\r\nce or Protection in your theory. Is=C3=82=C2=A0this intermediate zone as yo=\r\nu say is created by Her and part of Her creation=C3=82=C2=A0or by=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0somebody else.=C3=82=C2=A0 Does=C3=82=C2=A0She needs some visa to go the=\r\nre if she is=C3=82=C2=A0not the Creater.=C3=82=C2=A0As you say all higher d=\r\neity are there but less in ability. Does the deities have even less =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0ability on earth plane.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I am sure this is not yo=\r\nur theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain p=\r\nerson reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think whatever this guy=\r\n is uttering is=C3=82=C2=A0complete truth, when in fact it is=C3=82=C2=A0fa=\r\nr from truth. Once=C3=82=C2=A0I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that D=\r\nivine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I c=\r\nould not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went dow=\r\nn the drain.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Pr=\r\notection and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of our human perceptio=\r\nn.

I am su=\r\nre there are only=C3=82=C2=A0devotee in this group. They may be doing haven=\r\n or japa or other devotional work.\n&gt; &gt; So nobody should=C3=82=C2=A0feel any=\r\n sort of fear or pressure even for one second because there is no such hocu=\r\ns pocus zone to cross and there is Grace of Divine Mother on all Her childr=\r\nen.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is very different=\r\n due to Darshan and=C3=82=C2=A0Grace of Divine Mother & Divine Lord.

Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of judgement =\r\nis to objectively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day=\r\n consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Som=\r\ne of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in its=\r\nelf. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and u=\r\nnderstand these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 Not all experiences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost them=\r\nselves in this jungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determin=\r\ne which is genuine and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  plane, driven by the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of=\r\n manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by=\r\n the overlapping influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana t=\r\no anahata. Everything=C3=82=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has =\r\na corresponding lesser manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability.=\r\n Similarly there are endless beings of varies character and hue who can ver=\r\ny easily create an expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path.=\r\n They can even fake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme ca=\r\nses, take hold of a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a w=\r\nhole wide world, the lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being=\r\n, a cementing of a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, pers=\r\nonal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but l=\r\nust suppressed) etc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if properl=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt;  channalized as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one e=\r\nxperience Divine Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide=\r\n to the path.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and au=\r\nthentic only to the extent that it helps to modify and transform your wakin=\r\ng surface personality. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of ex=\r\nperiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experience=\r\ns ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury without substance. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, whic=\r\nh has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away by the light and =\r\nsound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross this realm, and all sadhaka=\r\ns will have to cross this some day, is to hang on tightly to the fundamenta=\r\nls.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyakt=\r\nimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanutt=\r\namam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

Thought I wi=\r\nll share it here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Progress has little to do with speed; but m=\r\nuch to do with direction. So always concentrate on your direction, not on s=\r\npeed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For any genuine spiritual seeker, this\n&gt; &gt;  is one of t=\r\nhe sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, too many people get=\r\n caught up in the less important - aka, visions, &#39;experiences&#39;, tough-penan=\r\nces, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetting the goal o=\r\nf real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/emotions/body resulting=\r\n in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity to life situations,=\r\n an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening of lower emotions l=\r\nike lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious attachments, such tha=\r\nt eventually every action of the individual is like a consecration (sacrifi=\r\nce, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so away from our avera=\r\nge superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God is =\r\nnot the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive unfolding of a=\r\n transformation process.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complex rituals and speedy sadhanas a=\r\nnd experiences et al are ok, provided one does not\n&gt; &gt;  lose sight of the f=\r\nundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in cir=\r\ncles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritual e=\r\nntity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
