One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the momentum set in=\r\n motion by previously present conditioning. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engages in them with =\r\nno agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a jeevanmukta ope=\r\nrates the previous identity till the momentum comes to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a screeching h=\r\nalt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are returned =\r\nto the original sources from which they were borrowed and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made sentie=\r\nnt. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operating with a=\r\nn identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not from iden=\r\ntification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not any bet=\r\nter or any extra freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to =\r\noperate an identity after some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, that time depending on the stren=\r\ngth of prior momentum! It can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days or months or years or centuries=\r\n or millennia.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for =\r\nsome beings (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operat=\r\ne an identity for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very long time after conditioning drops off compl=\r\netely. It may even be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part =\r\nof the momentum set in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part =\r\nof one&#39;s ahamkara to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identify with a newly created identity (e.g. a n=\r\new incarnation).

I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe som=\r\nething more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than vaikhari in the following words so that people can=\r\n understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering your ques=\r\ntions is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perha=\r\nps benefit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - now or in future).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is not identification. The proble=\r\nm is *conditioning*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that driv=\r\nes the identification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies wit=\r\nh. If ahamkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta (conditionin=\r\ng) is cleaned up,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (identification) =\r\nremains while chitta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is jeevanmukt=\r\ni. It is as simple as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If =\r\none engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\narma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nonditioning in chitta) behind an action that bind one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identi=\r\nfied with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some co=\r\nnditioning,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may=\r\n be (!), then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reactio=\r\nn which will in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one ide=\r\nntified with when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the time the =\r\nreaction is experienced, all the conditioning may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overcome and o=\r\nne may become jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion before o=\r\nne became jeevanmukta will continue to affect the body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; senses and =\r\nsensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with. But=\r\n, because there is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires=\r\n, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trie=\r\ns to modify the happenings to what one is identifying with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning.=\r\n It is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is=\r\n more pain in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) require=\r\ns no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But th=\r\ninking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning in ch=\r\nitta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is id=\r\nentifying with a body, one does not view it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as something his own an=\r\nd something that must be kept in a particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. He identifies =\r\nwith it, but has no agendas for it. All that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes from conditionin=\r\ng in chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (lib=\r\nerated I-ness) views what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of po=\r\nrtions borrowed from various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mer=\r\ncury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation =\r\nof Light itself. One does not view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me=\r\n, I need to use it to pursue X or Y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this =\r\nis me. I am made of portions borrowed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. va=\r\nrious manifestations of Light. I observe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they=\r\n do, and I have no agenda pursue using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the e=\r\nssence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpa=\r\nm that we were discussing a while back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is=\r\n not the problem. It is the conditioning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives how one uses w=\r\nhat one identifies with, that is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself better, though, give=\r\nn how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may still g=\r\net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep d=\r\noing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got throat cancer because of his\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the kaarmik power of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; debated. Strictly speaking, whether Ramakrishna really became a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n jeevanmukta in that lifetime or not can also be debated. But those are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; not really useful debates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy MahaShivaRatri again!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Krishnarpanamastu, Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------    Free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/&gt; &lt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;http:/=\r\n/saraswatifilms.org/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;    Jy=\r\notish writings:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @hom=\r\nam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 2:20 AM, Manish Pandit wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Shr=\r\nee Rama Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was not the question. The question was=\r\n as I asked it. Why did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my question=\r\n presumes, that he got it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If his mind d=\r\nid not identify with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma, then the=\r\n karma would not have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no identification=\r\n, so no karma (like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body, then it i=\r\ns obvious that there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind with bo=\r\ndy, that he could not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. =\r\nNot that he was oblivious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was=\r\n a Jeevanmukta. So how can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that defini=\r\ntion, the mind must be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified a=\r\ns a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward. I await your reply=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindest regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt; pvr@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; =\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want t=\r\no answer a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange between my guru Ma=\r\nnish and me on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter exchang=\r\ne are quoted at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone i=\r\ns interested in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following questi=\r\non posed by Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to m=\r\ny mind is this: was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he s=\r\nuffer with throat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his action=\r\ns? (according to your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82 * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nloosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ninsentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rin=\r\nas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nnditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cont=\r\ninues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; condi=\r\ntioning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta =\r\n(liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; leaves bod=\r\ny and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but w=\r\nhich is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; uncondit=\r\nioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am t=\r\nhis body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (TH=\r\nAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). On\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ignored\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; exp=\r\neriencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; b=\r\nefore one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; el=\r\nectricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and register\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overco=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =\r\n=C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * This is a key=\r\n point: Manas and buddhi are good at making\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations=\r\n and rational deductions, but, by themselves,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY=\r\n agenda. They neither like something nor dislike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT c=\r\nomes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukt=\r\na is that THAT is absent! * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82  =C3=82 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a m=\r\noot question. A better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeev=\r\nanmukta get throat cancer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if the=\r\nre are no karmas or rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. But, l=\r\net me sum it up briefly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanendri=\r\nyas, karmendiyas, manas and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to op=\r\nerate as before. One&#39;s I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself on=\r\nto those. But neither I-ness nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or k=\r\narmas. Chitta - the repository of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clea=\r\nn. There are no limiting notions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & bu=\r\nddhi keep experiencing and doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on th=\r\ne previous momentum set by the play\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some =\r\nconditioning was left in chitta. Body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriya=\r\ns of jnana and karma and manas are all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from vari=\r\nous deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by proj=\r\necting awareness into them. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what dri=\r\nves how all these are viewed and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sen=\r\nse organ as a portion of Indra or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so an=\r\nd so sense organ&quot;, due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what cre=\r\nates karmas and rinas. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely* over=\r\ncome, ahamkara can still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but=\r\n it sees them for what they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiti=\r\nng notions like &quot;this throat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not fe=\r\nel painful&quot;. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevan=\r\nmuktas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the be=\r\nst\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama i=\r\ns a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and characterization of a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain better how to do\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectual exerc=\r\nise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ev=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a very=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. Tha=\r\nt is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Noth=\r\ning really, fulfilling all rnas, wait for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasim=\r\nha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b b=\r\nound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta?=\r\n Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may =\r\nbe the case. The rnas are of the body he or she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mu=\r\nkta because he experiences, actually sees the rnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;=\r\ns only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of=\r\n effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: We=\r\nll, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly=\r\n bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of body=\r\n&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happe=\r\nns to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thought, that, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; w=\r\nas the body, instead of this light. That is the original problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nWhich every being is born with. Rnas arise from this identification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, when the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light & bcomes\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevan=\r\nmukta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? because, that person although aware of the =\r\nlight at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet=\r\n directed d\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word =\r\nbeing &quot;all&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id=\r\n with light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r def=\r\nining is not a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mu=\r\nkta (liberated)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;sta=\r\nte&quot; from somebody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification=\r\n with light, most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id =\r\nwith light forever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivan=\r\nmukti! Jivanmukti is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different fr=\r\nom light? In fact, is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti =\r\nis seeing the play of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna=\r\n are contradictory\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pa=\r\ny back what u owe. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that means u dont owe anybody anything once=\r\n u r truly free. Words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often m=\r\nisused. Manish: Will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: =\r\nOK. :-) But, as far as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explai=\r\nned as clearly &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. M=\r\nanish: The question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmu=\r\nkta? If so, Why did he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he was not ide=\r\nntifying with his actions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretation of Va=\r\nsistha&#39;s definition??)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single de=\r\nfinition.
