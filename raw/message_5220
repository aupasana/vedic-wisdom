It is a continuum. As one be=\r\ncomes purer and increases self-control, one may get some results. Thus, a p=\r\nerson still afflicted by undesirable conditioning may acquire enough purity=\r\n to get some results. But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in t=\r\nhe end!\n \nWhat I called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;self-control&quot;. Both ar=\r\ne not that different.\n \nSurrender of slaves is not the surrender I am talki=\r\nng about when I talk about surrender to god. The instinct of self-preservat=\r\nion is another aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may suppress prid=\r\ne and self-importance out of no choice, for self-preservation. If one later=\r\n gets a chance to exert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing self-preservation, =\r\none may still do so. This is conditional surrender. In the case of god also=\r\n, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is a mess and one is helpless may sti=\r\nll be conditional surrender. But, when the surrender is unconditional and o=\r\nne sees god as the controller of all without any conditions attached, irres=\r\npective of whether life is good or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one=\r\n&#39;s self-control become better and better.\n \nA powerless person may also bec=\r\nome angry. But, as you said, his anger is powerless to do much harm. As one=\r\n&#39;s self-control increases, one&#39;s tendency to become angry comes down. That =\r\nincreases one&#39;s power. A person who has a perfect self-control like Shiva i=\r\ns infinitely powerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum. Hi=\r\ngher the self-control and purity, higher the power.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasim=\r\nha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFre=\r\ne &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n      =\r\n              http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a diffe=\r\nrence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n \n---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; =\r\nNamaskar,\n&gt;    How did Ravana got success with Mantras if success with Mant=\r\nras comes only with loss of Ahamkara and purity of mind ?\n&gt;    Where is the=\r\n liberation without shakti, even the slaves were humble, devoted and with c=\r\nomplete surrender to their masters, what results did they ever get ?\n&gt;    T=\r\nhere is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas gara=\r\nl ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet saral ho&quot;.
