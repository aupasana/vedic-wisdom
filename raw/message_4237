If we want to shape our consciousness in a particul=\r\nar useful way, some repeated actions coupled with some thoughts can be used=\r\n.\n \nThinking of stuck ancestors and praying for their freedom, while water =\r\nflows over some important energy centers in the palm, is certainly a useful=\r\n exercise.
