It is a\npath that is=\r\n both ancient in origin, and profound in its understanding\nof the nature of=\r\n reality. Sanatana Dharma is completely unlike any\nother religious traditio=\r\nn in existence. Rather than reflecting the\ndogmatically inclined expression=\r\ns of denominationalism, sectarianism,\nand divisive religious doctrines that=\r\n are of more recent origin,\nSanatana Dharma is a spiritual expression of th=\r\ne divine intelligence\nthat naturally underlies the more empirical aspects o=\r\nf our cosmos.\nSanatana Dharma is the Eternal Natural Way. As such, this pat=\r\nh\nrepresents the pre-religious, primordial essence of all true\nspirituality=\r\n, philosophy, and yearning to know the higher Reality, as\nwell as the very =\r\nfoundation of any and all attempts to establish a\ncivilization based upon e=\r\nternal ideals.&quot;\n\n- Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\nFrom: &quot; Sanatana Dharma: =\r\nEternal Natural Way &quot;.

She assumes\nvarious forms and takes on different divine energi=\r\nes to maintain\nharmony in the Universe, to combat evil and uphold the good.=\r\n A woman\nwho gains a transcendental state in sadhana comes back as a celest=\r\nial\nYogini or Bhairavi, a female adept at Yoga. She carries the energy of\nD=\r\nurga within her.\n\nA true Yogini is an enlightened woman with exuberant pass=\r\nion,\nspiritual powers and deep insight. Yoginis communicate a sense of\nfree=\r\ndom, a sheer mastery in whatever they do. With their compelling\ngazes, they=\r\n can hypnotize even a great yogi and are capable of\nchanging their shapes a=\r\nt will. Tantric scholars have written about\nYoginis as independent, outspok=\r\nen, forthright women with a\ngracefulness of spirit. Without them, yoga can =\r\nfail in its purpose and\nremain sterile.\n\nShakta texts honor both women and =\r\nthe Earth alike as sources of\nenergy, vitality, physical and spiritual well=\r\n-being. Noting this\nanalogy between a Yogini and the earth, an eleventh-cen=\r\ntury Tibetan\nCakrasamvara commentary states: &quot;Having recognized a Yogini wh=\r\no will\ndelight and transmit energy and power to him, and feeling passionate=\r\nly\nattracted to her, if the male aspirant does not worship that Yogini,\nshe=\r\n will not bless the yogi, and spiritual attainments will not\narise.&#39;&#39; Miran=\r\nda Shaw&#39;s book, Passionate Enlightenment, which was\nintroduced to me by Lok=\r\nesh Chandraji, first exposed the world of the\nYogini to me from a Buddhist =\r\nperspective.\n\nIn Hindu thought, the Yogini represents the Yoga Shakti herse=\r\nlf, the\nKundalini, as well as the resident powers or female deities of the\n=\r\ndifferent chakras. The Yogini possesses the power of Yoga herself and\ncan a=\r\nwaken that in others, not only generally but at any point or\nplace in the b=\r\nody or mind. A man&#39;s ability to achieve the higher\nstates of Yoga can be fa=\r\ncilitated by his association with such a\nfemale companion who reflects this=\r\n energy.\n\nJust as a Goddess blesses and benefits her devotees, and the Shak=\r\nti\nvivifies all biological, cultural, and religious practices, so a woman\nc=\r\nan channel this life force or spiritual energy to her\nconsort-devotee. A wo=\r\nman is no more depleted by providing this\nspiritual nourishment than a moth=\r\ner by nursing her child. In fact, it\ncauses deeper energies to well up from=\r\n within her.\n\nThis spiritual energy is not something that a man can extract=\r\n or take\nfrom a Yogini at will. She chooses when and on whom to bestow her\n=\r\nblessings. Her ability to enhance a man&#39;s spiritual development\ndepends upo=\r\nn her innate divinity as awakened and brought to fruition\nby her own yogic =\r\npractices, which include envisioning herself in the\nforms of various Goddes=\r\nses and investing herself with Their\nappearances and ornaments, tender and =\r\nwrathful expressions, and\nsupernatural powers for liberating beings. By con=\r\nferring energy and\ngrace upon a man - &#39;&#39;blessing &#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;empowering&#39;&#39; him -=\r\n she is not\nweakening herself but rather sharing her energy voluntarily wit=\r\nh one\nwho has won her favour by meeting the various requirements that she\nm=\r\nay impose.\n\nThis relationship parallels human-divine relationships in so fa=\r\nr as\nthe deity is the benefactor and the human devotee is the beneficiary.\n=\r\nAlthough the Deity may derive some gratification from the\nrelationship, the=\r\n devotee has much more to gain than does the\nsovereign object of his devoti=\r\non. What supplicants ultimately want\nfrom their deity is supreme deliveranc=\r\ne or liberation, and this is\nwhat male Tantrics should seek to gain from th=\r\neir relationships with\nspiritual women. Tantric texts reiterate that a man =\r\ncannot gain\nenlightenment without respecting women and allying himself inwa=\r\nrdly\nwith a woman. The woman&#39;s beneficence is a gracious, yet voluntary\nres=\r\nponse to her devotee&#39;s supplication, homage and worship.\n\nThe Goddess is a =\r\ngreat Yogini, devoted to Shiva, yet matching His\npowers. She is the embodim=\r\nent of pure energy, the Mother and matrix of\nall manifestation, the source =\r\nof all time, space and creation. As they\npracticed Yoga together, Shakti ac=\r\ncepted Shiva as her Guru, and he\ntaught her the ways of transcendent being =\r\nto guide her to her ultimate\nliberation. Shiva in turn also accepted Shakti=\r\n as his Guru, and she\ninitiated him into his ultimate liberation through pu=\r\ntting him in\ntouch with the supreme power of consciousness.\n\nThe Goddess Ch=\r\nhinnamasta, the deity who cuts off her own head,\nsymbolizes the great Yogin=\r\ni, the wonderful consciousness beyond the\nmind. She represents the opened T=\r\nhird Eye from which flashes forth the\nlightening of direct perception that =\r\ndestroys all duality and\nnegativity. She is the Yoga Shakti or power of Yog=\r\na in its most\ndramatic action of granting enlightenment. Hence she is also =\r\nknown as\nVajra Yogini. The Vajra is the supreme lightning force of the inne=\r\nr Self.\n\nChhinnamasta is the Para-Dakini, the supreme or foremost of the\nDa=\r\nkinis, the attendant Goddesses on the yogic path, who are the\nyoginis as th=\r\ne powers of the chakras. Sadhakas seeking the path of\noccult or yogic power=\r\ns should worship her, as reiterated by David\nFrawley in his book Tantric Yo=\r\nga and the Wisdom Goddesses, invoking\nher through the mantra based on her n=\r\name as Vajra Vairochani. This\nfacilitates all inner transformations in a dr=\r\namatic way.\nThe Yogini is also Bhairavi or the Goddess of Fire below in the=\r\n\nmuladhara or root chakra. It is she who becomes Chhinnamasta as she\nreache=\r\ns the third eye and opens the crown chakra beyond. Her blood is\nlight that =\r\nillumines everything.\n\nMary Magdalene was such a Yogini, manifesting her Sh=\r\nakti through the\nflow of light from her heart and soul. Her Divine love was=\r\n\nunconditional and independent of external situations and dogmas. Yet\nDivin=\r\ne love is not limited to the ascetic. In my understanding of\nTantra, if two=\r\n spiritually evolved beings come together in\nunconditional love, they also =\r\ncan create an energy field that is most\npositive and rare, exuding high vib=\r\nrational levels of peace and love\ninto the universe.\n\nThe ancient cultures =\r\nof Egypt, Greece, Tibet and India have esoteric\ntraditions glorifying the i=\r\nnitiatory power of the woman. She is\nconsidered to be the high priestess wh=\r\no unfolds all higher knowledge\nand powers for us. She is Sophia, the source=\r\n and font of wisdom or\nPrajna, the deepest insight into the nature of thing=\r\ns. Tantric\nteachings stress the importance of physical beauty in a companio=\r\nn but\nonly to initially stimulate and then elevate passion from the sensual=\r\n\nto the spiritual plane. The beauty of the soul surpasses physical beauty.\n=\r\n\nThe `initiatory&#39; power of woman is tremendous, providing the force of\npass=\r\nion that is necessary for developing experiential mysticism. By\nsharing the=\r\n secrets of love, a woman can bestow transcendental power\non her lover. The=\r\n highest form of Shakti is the direct expression of\nthe wisdom-energy she r=\r\neleases, creating a joyful transformation. A\nwoman can initiate her partner=\r\n into such mystical experiences through\ntrust, surrender to higher ideals a=\r\nnd spontaneity. It is the Goddess\nwithin each woman who really initiates.\n\n=\r\nTo be a Yogini is the highest spiritual goal for all women. It is the\nway t=\r\no become one with the Goddess within and to bring her out in\nexpression to =\r\nuplift the world that is really her creation. Yet it is\nnot an outer appear=\r\nance but a state of inner energy and ecstasy that\nmakes the Yogini.
