I do not include Brahman in any &quot;snapshot=\r\n&quot; since it is non material and invariant anyway.\n\na) Is the Ahamkara gone a=\r\nfter they enter NVKS? If so, how do they return from NVKS, and who is this =\r\n&quot;they&quot; anyway?\nb) If Ahamkara and consequently sookshma sarira are still th=\r\nere, how are they different. \nc) If they are not different, what quantity i=\r\ns it in the person that has gotten enlightened/changed?\nAll these questions=\r\n are related to the &quot;doughnut questions&quot; I posed in http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3357, but I guess you didnt see those (and that=\r\n&#39;s quite ok by me, you have so many people constantly expecting replies)\n\nR=\r\negards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Some people who can reach Nirvikalpa samadhi may=\r\n sometimes be in Nirvikalpa samadhi and sometimes in other dualistic samadh=\r\nis. For example, Totapuri was familiar only with non-dual Nirvikalpa samadh=\r\ni, but Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to go to non-dual Nirvikalpa samadhi as=\r\n well as other dualistic samadhis frequently.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\n\n\n"}}
