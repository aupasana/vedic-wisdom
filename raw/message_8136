I requested him several times to re=\r\nlive me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I lo=\r\nve him. I want to pray him.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Currently, my mind and it&#39;s racin=\r\ng evil &amp; foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and tryi=\r\nng to keep me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they=\r\n dominated me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now my questions are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi that t=\r\nhis is happening to me?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Why does it happen to me?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is it\n so=\r\nme kind of disorder&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Am in incurring wrath of god&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am=\r\n scared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 10=\r\n0 births&lt;BR&gt;&gt; What can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to=\r\n concentrate on him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I want to worship god like every one does&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; I am highly stressed because of this constant battle. My forehead area, =\r\njaws are always in pain because of this stress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Please hel=\r\np me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard or discard my email. This=\r\n is a situation I can&#39;t disclose to anyone in person with the fear of hatre=\r\nd and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief from learned scholars like=\r\n yourself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1279670611-1000122222-1334647615=:27730--\r\n\n"}}
