I personally admire Shivaji, Maharana=\r\n Pratap and Sardar Patel and have placed them to the highest of my ideals. =\r\nSardar Patel is the one for whom i have same love and respect as Thakur Ram=\r\nakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Narasimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the i=\r\ndeal statesman who did us proud not only by effectively countering religiou=\r\ns fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY OPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA =\r\nSAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATTACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fanta=\r\nstic and fitting to the ideals of Sanatan Dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; Regarding Dr. =\r\nZakir Naik: I did not know about him initially. a year and half back, i vis=\r\nited Oman and there once i switched on TV where in i saw that person on &#39;Pe=\r\nace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of a gathering and he used a word &#39;=\r\nVeda&#39; which interested me to go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic bu=\r\nt i felt so much saddened by his lecture. The reason was that he kept on at=\r\ntacking Veda/Hinduism and Christianity for proving his points. Immediately =\r\nin my mind came channels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religio=\r\nus pundits (most of them are Hindus)  come for discourses. and i do not rem=\r\nember any instance where in they have attacked any religious sentiments of =\r\nother faiths to uphold values of Sanatan Dharma. there is such an obvious c=\r\nontrast.\n&gt; after that first lecture, i watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and w=\r\nas convinced that this person is not a true spiritual leader but a polished=\r\n intellectual who essentially is a fanatic and then never stopped to see hi=\r\nm further. I remember having a debate at the same site (at Oman) with a You=\r\nng person of Islamic faith. we debated on the issue and i frankly asked him=\r\n to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking him that does he really believe that ot=\r\nher religions and faith are also true. I must say that, i found that young =\r\nMuslim engineer had much more tolerance and understanding than Dr Zakir Nai=\r\nk.\n&gt; The unfortunate part is that the broad minded people of today&#39;s genera=\r\ntions are getting corrupted by such fanatic leaders.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; As i have m=\r\nany Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good friends), i never loose a chance=\r\n to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39; t=\r\nhe other religious faiths but also we must belive in our heart of hearts th=\r\nat every faith/religion is true and we must never try to convert people of =\r\nother religion to our religion but on the contrary we must discourage a per=\r\nson who wants to formally convert by telling him/her that yours is also rig=\r\nht and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I absolutely echo Thakur Ramakr=\r\nsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are there&quot;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; About Sri Sr=\r\ni, i must say that i believe him as a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some pas=\r\nt experiences which makes me believe that.

The actions of an englightened mas=\r\nter established in Sahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental conce=\r\npts of how things should be. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  For example, when Sri Krishna - an =\r\nAvatar of the highest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasandh a=\r\nttacked Mathura instead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna hi=\r\nmself years later would advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can=\r\n we give a satisfying intellectual answer to it if people raise questions?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was someth=\r\ning like: If Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be a lim=\r\nitation in itself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a l=\r\narger and more complete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse hav=\r\ne to read the original to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Another instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Raman=\r\na Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it=\r\n with equanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one c=\r\nan intellectually argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram and in=\r\nmates from the thieves. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Besides, there were certain things that I=\r\n did not want to put in an public email. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silverj=\r\nubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya toget=\r\nher happened around Feb 16, 2006.

Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained logicall=\r\ny by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty about an =\r\nenlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain them =\r\nin our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much higher=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental unders=\r\ntanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do not=\r\n expect my answers to satisfy all the questions.

In fact, this is a question that was raised by d=\r\nisciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if one looks in=\r\nto it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who h=\r\nas commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an authority on ved=\r\nanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the Bhagavad G=\r\nita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and who gives imp=\r\nromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all topics under th=\r\ne sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are about his hom=\r\ne turf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He neve=\r\nr debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can =\r\nshow the way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not int=\r\nerested in anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity in the he=\r\nart of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and let it =\r\npass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the questions that were rais=\r\ned in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various comm=\r\nentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may ask why then did h=\r\ne go to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was somet=\r\nhing like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice=\r\n to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedl=\r\ny the topic of discussion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from th=\r\ne audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone=\r\n, especially those among us that are intellectually curious about spiritual=\r\nity than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experie=\r\nnce first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL,=\r\n there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will onl=\r\ny say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his pre=\r\nsence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. =\r\nA Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental=\r\n concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in=\r\n silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are s=\r\necondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words is to =\r\ncreate inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, there is n=\r\no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immens=\r\ne blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri o=\r\nr someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being inste=\r\nad of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable examples o=\r\nf very simple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big in=\r\ntellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. S=\r\nometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign i=\r\ngnorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it=\r\n would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an ill=\r\niterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience =\r\n(at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating=\r\n knowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet another mental conce=\r\npt and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle =\r\nand dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sa=\r\ndhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, ang=\r\ner, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.=\r\n However I have one issue with Sri Ravishankar.

The vedios are available for fre=\r\ne on youtube, for anyone who wants to see how that debate went.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 5/11/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] AOL: Seamless blend of Raja, Karma, Bhakti and Gnana Yogas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: schinnas@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dat=\r\ne: Thursday, 5 November, 2009, 5:12 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; You sent this mail to me instead of the list.

I =\r\noccasionally visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL a=\r\nnd the below email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s=\r\n spiritual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, =\r\nI want to clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of =\r\nSat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devot=\r\nion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That doe=\r\ns not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo=\r\n would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly e=\r\nmerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slow=\r\nly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yo=\r\nga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not=\r\n just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pra=\r\nnayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind =\r\nand preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of contemp=\r\nlation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice o=\r\nf Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequ=\r\nence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) ta=\r\nught in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kri=\r\nya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance co=\r\nurses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The K=\r\nnowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhak=\r\nti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sr=\r\ni Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the above. His =\r\ncommentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly availab=\r\nle commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides dail=\r\ny study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and =\r\ncontemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to become A=\r\nrt of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises =\r\non Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bha=\r\njans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some =\r\nwonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack of a Sa=\r\ndhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my pers=\r\nonal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master liv=\r\ning in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devote=\r\nes in every step of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. S=\r\neveral get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice=\r\n), some in person and several via various other ways. However, to get these=\r\n guidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that sta=\r\nge, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries =\r\non various Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage whe=\r\nre conscious inner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are =\r\nyogis of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness =\r\nat will during meditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri=\r\n Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak=\r\n as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept tho=\r\nse that left their body as having achieved highest realization such as Sri =\r\nAurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human ten=\r\ndency to doubt them when they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volu=\r\nnteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravish=\r\nankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the charitable activiti=\r\nes again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teachers have given up ve=\r\nyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to become teachers and =\r\nteach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the money. All senior=\r\n AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes ev=\r\nen dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a tim=\r\ne when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum number of peop=\r\nle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their=\r\n lives by going without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalit=\r\nes, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka,=\r\n etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that those that paid fo=\r\nr the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s=\r\n guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course because they c=\r\nannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL c=\r\nourses and know first hand many cases where people took courses for free an=\r\nd were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster str=\r\nikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teac=\r\nh courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not adverti=\r\nse it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understa=\r\nnding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers =\r\nand volunteers who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards=\r\n and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long =\r\nas one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happ=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
