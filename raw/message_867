T=\r\nhe \nfirst Chandi Homam took 4 Hours (Which included almost everything \ngive=\r\nn in Manual)\n\n* When I took little short cut, it took 3 hours.\n\n* It Takes =\r\nme 1 hour 25 minutes to read Chandi Paath (13 \nchapters).   \n\n* In my opini=\r\non, Loud or Mental, it depends as to which way one is \ncomfortable and enjo=\r\nys the Homam. As for me, i enjoy little loud \nchanting.\n\n* If i write, does=\r\nn&#39;t really mean gain of knowledge. I have done \nhomam for say around 40 tim=\r\nes. There may be members who are doing \nHomam for last 1 or 2 years without=\r\n making any fuss. I am not trying \nto be *artificially humble* but giving y=\r\nou the facts. My father \noften says `Bahu Ratnaani Vasudhara&#39; . I am sure t=\r\nhere would be many \nRatnaas on this group who likes to remain silent. On th=\r\ne contrary I \nlike to write if I feel like writing, without worrying about =\r\n\nanything.\n\ni would request you and others to address me as just Utpal.\n\n* =\r\n`Garu&#39; is a Respectful word in Telugu Language.  Like `Shree&#39;. I \nam addres=\r\nsing Narasimha with `Garu&#39; since some 3 years now. But I \ndon&#39;t put `Ji&#39; be=\r\ncause it gives me feeling of distance. It is his \ngreatness as he doesn&#39;t m=\r\nind even if I write his name without any \npre or Suffix.  I address him var=\r\niedly as Garu / Narasimha Garu/Rao \nGaru/Narasimha. There is no consistency=\r\n in addressing him :) but I \nwant to be consistent in following his spiritu=\r\nal instructions.   \n\nI apologize to the list if there were lot of valueless=\r\n writings in \nthis message.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpalji,\n&gt; You=\r\n=C2=A0have taken initiation from=C2=A0Narsimhaji and you have really \ngaine=\r\nd the knowledge.

In \nsimple=C2=A0chanting of only 13 chapters I take complete o=\r\nne hour.I am \nchanting mentally only. But if I do Homam, I think mentally i=\r\nt is \nnot possible. Isn&#39;t it?

You can b=\r\nreak each \n&gt; coconut Half with your both the Palms and make 3 to 4 pieces.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) A very small bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is \n&gt; suf=\r\nficient as &#39;Ghee Aahutis&#39; are to be given as only a single drop \n&gt; whenever=\r\n it is mentioned in the Manual.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically =\r\nnot mentioned, one can offer \n&gt; Aaahutis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahsh=\r\newnuts, Kishmis, \nDaadiya \n&gt; etc... Now one can choose each of the above st=\r\nuffs one by one for \n&gt; offering as aahuti or can use single stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; to =\r\nelaborate, at each Swaha, one can take One Kishmis or Few \nMamara \n&gt; or one=\r\n almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer to Agni.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have=\r\n Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuff \n&gt; which can be off=\r\ner in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered \nas \n&gt; Aahuti same as like=\r\n other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take \n&gt; very little &#39;Havan samgri=\r\n powder and offer it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus one person can easily perform homam as expl=\r\nained above \nbecause \n&gt; firstly, one doesn&#39;t need to give Aahutis of Ghee a=\r\nnd other stuff \n&gt; simultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be d=\r\none with \n&gt; left fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2 kg of=\r\n Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms \n&gt; will be suffic=\r\nient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The Homa Fire r=\r\nepresents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. \n&gt; hence it is suggested tha=\r\nt Aahutis are only offered by You alone \n&gt; while mother and others can sit =\r\nbeside you and concentrate. they \n&gt; will gain lot of spiritual benefit just=\r\n by attending.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of that cop=\r\nper one can \n&gt; also be used.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) I have not much idea about the way of =\r\npriest who offer ghee \n&gt; aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i th=\r\nink i&#39;ve also \nseen \n&gt; that during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatr=\r\ni. I suppose \nit \n&gt; also must be one of the right ways. however i have comp=\r\nlete faith \nin \n&gt; what Narasimha has given in Manual and that also must be =\r\nthe other \n&gt; right way of many ways. although you can choose between the ab=\r\nove \n&gt; two, i recommend to go as per the Manual if you are going to do as \n=\r\n&gt; per the manual given by him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, i would suggest not to bother y=\r\nourself with much \n&gt; technicalities and burden of perfection. in the first =\r\nfew runs, \n&gt; there are many things during Havan which can go imperefct. do =\r\nas \nper \n&gt; manual and enjoy you Homam with your mother & others and offcour=\r\nse \n&gt; with the mother of universe !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope, i gave you the answers -=\r\n Beautifully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n&gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ &gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to do =\r\nhomam for chandi \n&gt; devi.I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had arranged a copper tray in square shap=\r\ne.Almost 1 feet by 1 \n&gt; &gt; feet. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So is it good measurement or not ? I=\r\n also bought havan \nsamagri, \n&gt; &gt; dry \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coconuts etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Act=\r\nually i want to start with short cut \n&gt; method \n&gt; &gt; &gt; so please advice me t=\r\nhat ,how much ghee,havan samagri, dry \n&gt; coconut \n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc are used in one=\r\n havana, so that i will plan these items \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accordingly. I have arrange=\r\nd 2 kg of havan samagri, 1 kg dry \n&gt; &gt; coconuts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc..So how to divid=\r\ne this in ratio as per single day \n&gt; process.How \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much ghee in grams =\r\nper havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf \n&gt; notes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on homam again an=\r\nd again but doing practical things r \ndifficult \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need much m=\r\nore focus and methodology.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although by God grace and your enco=\r\nuragement to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; people for doing homams, even i myself get transformed =\r\ntowards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam ,so thanks for that. But i need your step by step \ngui=\r\ndance \n&gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything is not included in your notes( although its=\r\n best \n&gt; notes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on homam). Its my weakness actually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In normal homams by priests in India ,they do \n&gt; swaha \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with ghee=\r\n in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after \nthey \n&gt; &gt; pour \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gh=\r\nee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of \n&gt; ghee \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nin water too. So is it correct way or not ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If single p=\r\nerson is doing a homam then how to \n&gt; &gt; manage \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ahutis of ghee and sa=\r\nmagri both and of course mantra mala or \n&gt; notes \n&gt; &gt; u \n&gt; &gt; &gt; provided ? B=\r\ncz in India, normally full group or family do \nhomams \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pries=\r\nt only says mantras.So i think two people r must for \nhomam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n have spoon made of wood ,Is it ok or i have to \n&gt; &gt; buy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of copper m=\r\netal ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am still unmarried so can i do with my mother \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chandi homam ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please provide me some beautif=\r\nul answers of these \n&gt; &gt; queries.And \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dont mind if my queries prove t=\r\no be very simple and \n&gt; illogical.But \n&gt; &gt; i \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to start from basi=\r\ncs .So just cooperate with me as i love \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; work with perfection.=\r\nIn next mail i will ask some queries on \n&gt; &gt; mantras \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in order to und=\r\nerstand properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; U r really spreading vedic wisdom in true pr=\r\nactical sense.
