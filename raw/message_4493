Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate =\r\non the verses and in future, and that=C2=A0someone has to come up with a mo=\r\nre holistic and deeper interpretation of the Vedic riks.

Many have experienced the same, many more will in the=C2=A0=\r\nfuture. And all this has been possible only because the Divine Mother wants=\r\n it so.

I had posted a message =\r\nin jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of reme=\r\ndies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing thes=\r\ne topics.\n\nI have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji=\r\n and the video of a homam being performed and have the following observatio=\r\nns to make.\n\n1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which des=\r\ncribe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a =\r\nvikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n\n2. A=\r\nll steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some ex=\r\nist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody t=\r\no judge which are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down=\r\n by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n\n3. There are variations in pro=\r\ncedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, as=\r\nvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n\n4. The ordinary materials such as f=\r\nire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they ar=\r\ne divinised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine proced=\r\nure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of th=\r\ne volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance=\r\n of these steps.\n\n5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any =\r\nof the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mi=\r\nx of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n\n6. In paristarana or laying the darbha=\r\n aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeed=\r\ning darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n\n7. The dire=\r\nction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savit=\r\na prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not=\r\n be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from N=\r\nE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n\n8 Patraasadanam or =\r\nkeeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n=\r\n\n9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is =\r\nmissing.\n\n10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.\n\n11. Pr=\r\naneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchada=\r\nnam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n\n12. Brahma varanam ( at=\r\n least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n\n13. Ajya samskaram or purification of=\r\n the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.=\r\n\n\n14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missi=\r\nng. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou).\n\n15. Placement of paridhi=\r\n and aagharasamit is missing.\n\n16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed n=\r\number of samits in the agni iis missing.\n\n17. It is seen in the video that =\r\nwith a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in dr=\r\nops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise i=\r\nt will lead to dravyalopa.\n\nand many more ............\n\n18. Strictly speaki=\r\nng, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone e=\r\nxists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka)=\r\n. Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries th=\r\ne offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam=\r\n (secondary or not necessary)\n\n18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is i=\r\nnvoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the dei=\r\nty or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering =\r\nthe specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n\n19. Very good alternate homa proce=\r\ndures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for exampl=\r\ne) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t ha=\r\nve to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures =\r\nare designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can b=\r\ne easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n\n20. Homam should not be =\r\nseen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. I=\r\nt involves learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision=\r\n and perfection.\n\n21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge i=\r\nn its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty h=\r\nelp to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1599985519-1277029196=:41186\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry my previous mail went off incomple=\r\nte!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Welcome to t=\r\nhis forum.

The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with th=\r\ne mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be\n from SE corner to NE=\r\n corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a c=\r\nircle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vesse=\r\nl above darbha is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for=\r\n purification of the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. Patra samskaram or pur=\r\nifying the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avaha=\r\nnam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with=\r\n darbha) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma)=\r\n is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and pary=\r\nagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;14. Darvee=\r\n samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always t=\r\no spoons are to be used (sruksruvou).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;15. Placement of paridhi and a=\r\nagharasamit is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;16. Idhma\n pradanam or placement of a fixed =\r\nnumber of samits in the agni iis missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;17. It is seen in the vide=\r\no that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are give=\r\nn in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Othe=\r\nrwise it will lead to dravyalopa.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and many more ............&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into=\r\n agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other =\r\ngods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tya=\r\nga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is i=\r\nnvoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;18. In the tantrik =\r\nprocedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as =\r\nthe jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity =\r\n(agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;19.=\r\n Very good alternate homa\n procedures are available in the mantra sastra (r=\r\nefer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve v=\r\neda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciati=\r\non and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perfor=\r\nm homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any d=\r\nevata.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work o=\r\nut that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru=\r\n and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;21. I suggest=\r\n that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may n=\r\not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncor=\r\nrupted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-1599985519-1277029196=:41186--\r\n\n"}}
