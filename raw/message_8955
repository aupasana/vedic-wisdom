Very interesting.\n\n        This reminds me of an incident with a good f=\r\nriend of mine. There is an individual I know, who had never chanted the Sav=\r\nitur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as per his own confession, no sp=\r\necial love or attraction for this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin fa=\r\nmily, there was no religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introd=\r\nuced to this mantra. \n\n        One day while meditating on some Tantrik man=\r\ntras, he got a random inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had=\r\n a vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of corre=\r\nct swara or intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and soundlessly, t=\r\nhe Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of the mantra, he f=\r\nelt/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous=\r\n, pure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outsid=\r\ne our world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told m=\r\ne, was to enter into that stream of Light above and see things from that pe=\r\nrspective. But as long as there are impurities in the mind and body, it is =\r\nnot possible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in a stable=\r\n equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of rajas is=\r\n conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, self-assurance of satwa le=\r\nading to a deeper equanimity in mind and life is needed.\n\n        Apparentl=\r\ny, he also realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma which serve a=\r\n similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to the spiritual=\r\n planes above.\n\n        So I asked him why did you not continue the meditat=\r\nion or japa of Gayatri mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said i=\r\nt would have pulled him in and he would not have been able to continue the =\r\nspiritual practices which he was already doing for some time, and leaving s=\r\nomething half way is not good.\n\n\n        Reading the explanation your provi=\r\nded below, that is : \n\n        &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who imp=\r\nels (prachodayaat) our (naH) thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle e=\r\nyesight. Without his light, we would not be able to distinguish different o=\r\nbjects. This is explained in the Aitaterya Upanishad =93The sun, having bec=\r\nome eyesight, entered the eyes=94.

He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gayatri mantra. It st=\r\narts with a summary in 32 shlokas, followed by an introduction. He then giv=\r\nes 4 explanations / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2) narayana,=\r\n (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.\n\n        I am not attempting a literal =\r\nor scholarly translation ...

I=92ll start with the first of the meditations, o=\r\nn Gayatri.\n\n         ----\n\n        The first meditation is the =93common=94=\r\n understanding of the Gayatri mantra, with the Sun as the devata. This foll=\r\nows the famous verse from the Agastya Smriti -- =93yo devaH savitA  .asmAka=\r\nm dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe=\r\n=94. \n\n        We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) o=\r\nf the deva (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of =\r\nthe sun, which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to med=\r\nitate upon.\n\n        Whatever is experienced is easy to meditate upon, and =\r\nthat which is not experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone c=\r\nan meditate upon the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gay=\r\natri mantra is always taken first. \n\n        vareNyam =3D whatever we can a=\r\nsk / desire. Through all karmas and upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask =\r\nfor is vareNyam. =93Savitaa&quot; is the fruit of all karmas ... this is taught =\r\nin the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long explanation follows, which is omitted =\r\nhere ].  We meditate upon the splendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.\n\n    =\r\n    We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)=\r\n thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light, =\r\nwe would not be able to distinguish different objects. This is explained in=\r\n the Aitaterya Upanishad =93The sun, having become eyesight, entered the ey=\r\nes=94. He thus blesses all living beings. \n\n        ----\n\n        Sent from=\r\n Windows Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \r\n--Boundary_(ID_gIzvbAcxN9tfqGJJP5opRA)\r\nContent-type: text/html; charset=Windows-1252\r\nContent-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dwindows-1252&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META con=\r\ntent=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.5730.1001&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACK=\r\nGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Gay=\r\natri is an Intellectual Brilliance \nMantra.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This mantra is capable of endowing intellectual brillian=\r\nce, as \nexperienced by Aurobindo and others.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;T=\r\nhe brain becomes sharp and is exalted by the Mantra.

Personally, at that speed, I \n    would en=\r\nd up &quot;singing&quot; the mantra.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;sasneham,&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ajit&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n    &lt;DIV class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;On Sun, Jan 13, 2013 at 6:44 AM, Jyot=\r\nisa Shisya &lt;SPAN \n    dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:achyutagaddi@...=\r\nm&quot; \n    target=3D_blank&gt;achyutagaddi@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n  =\r\n  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE class=3Dgmail_quote \n    style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(204,204,20=\r\n4) 1px solid&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well Rajarshi,\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Your email triggered some random thoughts in me.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;I have tried to medidate on the Gayatri mantra during m=\r\ny prayer.

Very interesting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This \n        reminds me of an i=\r\nncident with a good friend of mine. There is an \n        individual I know,=\r\n who had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra \n        ever. He used to=\r\n feel, as per his own confession, no special love or \n        attraction fo=\r\nr this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin family, there \n        was no=\r\n religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introduced to \n        t=\r\nhis mantra. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One day while meditating on some Tantrik mantras, \n    =\r\n    he got a random inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a=\r\n \n        vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all o=\r\nf \n        correct swara or intonation. So he started chanting, mentally an=\r\nd \n        soundlessly, the Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 =\r\njapas of \n        the mantra, he felt/saw - and I describe it as he told me=\r\n - an unbroken \n        steam of tremendous, pure, flood of Golden Light ab=\r\nove his head. Like a \n        world above and outside our world. Intensely =\r\npure, intensely Divine. The \n        eventual idea, he told me, was to ente=\r\nr into that stream of Light above \n        and see things from that perspec=\r\ntive. But as long as there are \n        impurities in the mind and body, it=\r\n is not possible to enter into that \n        realm easily. The gunas must b=\r\ne in a stable equilibrium. Neither the \n        laziness of Tamas, nor the =\r\nimpatience of rajas is conducive for it, but \n        the stable, illuminat=\r\ning, self-assurance of satwa leading to a deeper \n        equanimity in min=\r\nd and life is needed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Apparently, he also \n        realized that the=\r\nre are some Tantrik mantras of Ma which serve a similar \n        purpose as=\r\n the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to the spiritual \n        planes ab=\r\nove.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So I asked him why did you not continue the \n        meditation=\r\n or japa of Gayatri mantra, since there was a nice experience. \n        He =\r\nsaid it would have pulled him in and he would not have been able to \n      =\r\n  continue the spiritual practices which he was already doing for some \n   =\r\n     time, and leaving something half way is not good.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reading t=\r\nhe \n        explanation your provided below, that is : &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;We meditate=\r\n upon \n        that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH) thoug=\r\nhts \n        (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his ligh=\r\nt, we \n        would not be able to distinguish different objects. This is =\r\nexplained in \n        the Aitaterya Upanishad&nbsp;=93The sun, having becom=\r\ne eyesight, entered \n        the eyes=94. He thus blesses all living beings=\r\n.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;.. matches with \n        the description that I had heard from my=\r\n friend.
