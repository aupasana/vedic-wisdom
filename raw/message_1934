Bali&#39;s episode is one amongst some more when Lors Rama&#39;s Maryaada and con=\r\nduct is questioned. he is being criticised by some for Marich event, Sita&#39;s=\r\n Agniparikha, Foresaking of Sita Mata etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; But i strongly feel that =\r\nthere will be much more depth in all that which we are not aware and events=\r\n are just on the surface, which generally look at and form our opinions. ho=\r\nwever people also provide counter arguments to justify all the above events=\r\n for which Rama is questioned. like when you mentioned Vaali&#39;s killing, i m=\r\nay say that to kill Vaali, there was no option but to Kill him the way he w=\r\nas killed. and if we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against Dhar=\r\nma towards his brother. However Rama also took the brunt of that Karma on h=\r\nimself in the later life during Krishna Incarnation. BUT what is the use of=\r\n all these arguments?
