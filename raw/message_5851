A. Ramanathan\nPublished by The Theosophical Publish=\r\ning House, Chennai\n\nI-8. When the mind is calmed down into its source and g=\r\noes in the true path,\nthe results dependent on activities are unreal as the=\r\n objects of the senses\nare confounded (i.e. actions performed do not affect=\r\n him as he is without\nattachment).\n\nI-9. It is the mind that constitutes wo=\r\nrldly life; this should be purified.\nAs the mind, so the things appear colo=\r\nured by it; this is the eternal\nsecret.\n\nI-10. By the purity of the mind on=\r\ne destroys (the effect of) good and bad\nactions. When with a pure mind one =\r\nremains in the Self one enjoys\ninexhaustible bliss.\n\nI-11. If a person=E2=\r\n=80=99s mind, which is well attached to the region of the\nsense-objects, we=\r\nre turned towards Brahman, who will not be released from\nbondage ?\n\nI-12-14=\r\n. One should feel the supreme Lord to be present in the midst of the\nlotus =\r\nof one=E2=80=99s heart as the spectator of the dance of the intellect, as t=\r\nhe\nabode of supreme love, as beyond the range of mind and speech, as he res=\r\ncue\nship scattering all worry (of those sinking in the sea of worldly life)=\r\n, as\nof the nature of effulgent Existence alone, as beyond thought, as the\n=\r\nindispensable, as incapable of being grasped by the (active) mind,\npossessi=\r\nng uncommon attributes, the immobile, steady and deep, neither light\nnor da=\r\nrkness, free from all doubts and semblance, and is consciousness\nconsisting=\r\n of the final beatitude.\n\nI-17. Those ignorant people who stick to castes a=\r\nnd orders of life obtain\nthe (worthless) fruit of their respective actions.=\r\n Those who discard the\nways of caste, etc., and are happy with the bliss of=\r\n the Self become merged\nin Brahman (lit. Purushas).\n\nI-18. The body consist=\r\ning of various limbs and observing the (rules of)\ncastes and orders has a b=\r\neginning and an end and is only a great trouble.\nFree of attachment to one=\r\n=E2=80=99s children, etc., and the body, one should live in\nthe endless sup=\r\nreme happiness.\n\nII-3. True knowledge consists of seeing non-different (in =\r\nall); deep\nmeditation consists of the mind freed from thinking on sensory o=\r\nbjects;\nbathing is the removal of impurity in the mind and cleansing consis=\r\nts of\ncontrolling the senses.\n\nII-4. He should imbibe the nectar, Brahman, =\r\ngo about for alms to preserve\nthe body, and becoming devoted to the one (Br=\r\nahman) live in the solitary\nplace of oneness free from duality.Thus should =\r\na wise man spend his life; he\nalone will attain liberation.\n\nII-5. This bod=\r\ny is born and it has death; it has originated from the impure\nsecretions of=\r\n the mother and father; it is the abode of joy and sorrow and\nit is impure.=\r\n Bathing in the form of discarding attachment to it is ordained\nwhen one to=\r\nuches it with the idea that it belongs to one.\n\nII-9. Viewing the body as =\r\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and mine is smearing oneself with faeces and\nurine in t=\r\nhe place of cosmetics. Thus pure cleansing has been spoken of (in\nthe verse=\r\ns above). Cleansing (the body) with mud and water is (the external\none) pra=\r\nctised in the world.\n\nII-10. Cleansing which purifies the mind consists of =\r\nthe destruction of the\nthree inborn tendencies (loka-vasana, shastra-vasana=\r\n and deha-vasana);\n(real) cleansing is said to be by washing with mud and w=\r\nater in the form of\n(true) knowledge and dispassion (Jnana and Vairagya).\n\n=\r\nII-12. After embracing renunciation of his own accord the wise man shall\nmo=\r\nve away from his native place and live far away, like a thief who has been\n=\r\nreleased from prison.\n\nII-13. No sooner has (the ascetic) moved away from t=\r\nhe son of ego, the\nbrother of wealth, the home of delusion and the wife of =\r\ndesires than he is\nliberated (from worldly bondage); there is no doubt abou=\r\nt it.\n\nII-14-15. How shall I perform the twilight worship (Sandhya, i.e., t=\r\nhere is\nno need for it) when the mother of delusion is (just) dead and the =\r\nson of\ntrue awakening is born, causing two-fold impurity ? How can I perfor=\r\nm\ntwilight worship when the bright sun of consciousness ever shines in the =\r\nsky\nof the heart and it never sets or rises ? (i.e. there is no twilight at=\r\n all\nand hence there is no scope for worship).\n\nII-17. There is liberation =\r\nfor those who are free from doubts; there is no\nemancipation even at the en=\r\nd of repeated births for those whose minds are\ninvaded by doubts (about the=\r\n non-duality of the Atman). Hence one should\nhave faith.\n\nII-19. One, to wh=\r\nom all primary desires, etc., (such as for wife, wealth and\nprogeny) appear=\r\n like vomit and who has discarded pride in his body, is\nentitled to renunci=\r\nation.\n\nII-21. He who renounces worldly life for amassing wealth (contribut=\r\ned by\nrich disciples) or for the sake of (assured) boarding and clothing or=\r\n for a\nstable position (as the head of a monastery) is doubly fallen (i.e. =\r\nhe has\nneither the full pleasures of worldly life nor liberation); he does =\r\nnot\ndeserve final beatitude.\n\nII-23. A fool in vain takes (theoretical) del=\r\night in Brahman without\npractically experiencing it (as I am Brahman), like=\r\n the joy of tasting\nfruits found in the branch of a tree reflected (in a la=\r\nke).\n\nII-26. Even learned people have their minds deluded by the illusion c=\r\nreated\nby me and without realizing me, the Atman, who am omnipresent, they =\r\nbut\nwander like cows to fill the wretched belly !\n\nIII-14. I am not the wor=\r\nld, I witness all and I am devoid of eyes, etc., I\nam immense, I am awake, =\r\nI am serene and I am Hara (Shiva).\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.org/108upan=\r\nishads/maitreya.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016361e8824372fe9049cba26f9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Translated by Prof. A.
