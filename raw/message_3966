Happiness, sorrows, success, failure everything about me=\r\n and my family is decided by god in advance. It is like a film. Whether I w=\r\nork or not, whatever god has decided will happen to my family. Whatever I a=\r\nnd my family are destined to get, we will get. Will my going to work or not=\r\n going to work change things?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Of course, one does not think that =\r\nway. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard to find a new job so that =\r\none&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened to the logic that &quot;everything a=\r\nbout me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Well, from one refere=\r\nnce frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But you, I and most people=\r\n (including great yogis) do not have access to that reference frame. From w=\r\nhere you stand, you have a free will using which you can engage in actions.=\r\n And you will later receive comparable reactions to those actions. From whe=\r\nre you stand, what actions you engage in is very important and decides your=\r\n future. Of course, at the end, you may have performed an action or skipped=\r\n an action only because god had already decided so. But you do try to perfo=\r\nrm what you think is the best action for you, don&#39;t you? In the previous ex=\r\nample where one lost a job, won&#39;t one look for a new job?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps=\r\n god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at home and family w=\r\nill suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit a=\r\nt home and yet something will happen and family will do fine. Perhaps god h=\r\nas decided that one will look for a job, but not get a job and family will =\r\nsuffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, get a job and=\r\n family will do fine.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is absolutely true that whichever of the=\r\n above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose=\r\n you have a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffering) and want to maximiz=\r\ne the chance (calculated based on what you know in your reference frame) th=\r\nat your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive m=\r\ninds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome=\r\n. However, given that you don&#39;t know what god willed and what will happen, =\r\nyou cannot convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL happen. So do n=\r\not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you can and be prepared for any out=\r\ncome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Su=\r\nppose you are trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a re=\r\nally heavy wind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you there =\r\nor you can row the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you constant=\r\nly re-evaluate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that you f=\r\ninally reach the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes you=\r\nr rowing, you cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not row =\r\nwell, wind may keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may not r=\r\neach the bank. You keep doing your best to row in the correct direction. If=\r\n wind took you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start cryin=\r\ng. Then wind may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective of the=\r\n outcome, the best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep ro=\r\nwing.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If you start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also=\r\n blowing harder than before and you are not making progress, do not stop ro=\r\nwing. If you do, you may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind d=\r\noes not blow the same way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come=\r\n when your rowing will be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes=\r\n you in the correct direction. So, just row row row your boat...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPonder on this metaphor a little.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe same logic that applies to looking for a job above applies to doing homa=\r\nm and other spiritual sadhana. Do they change your destiny? Yes, they do, i=\r\nn the same way looking for a job actively when you are out of one does.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and one will be=\r\n stuck without any progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will not do s=\r\nadhana and yet something will happen and one will make progress. Perhaps go=\r\nd has decided that one will do sadhana, but not make much progress in the n=\r\next few years or lives. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana an=\r\nd make good progress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is absolutely true that whichever of the=\r\n above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose=\r\n you have a desired outcome (e.g. spiritual progress) and want to maximize =\r\nthe chance (calculated based on what you know in your reference frame) that=\r\n your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive min=\r\nds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. =\r\nDo the best you can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outc=\r\nome.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just as searching for a job is a good strategy in general fo=\r\nr one without a job and wanting family not to suffer, doing spiritual sadha=\r\nna such as homam and japam is a good strategy in general for one wanting to=\r\n make spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I want to=\r\n emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up family and their=\r\n welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma you are doing now,=\r\n but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachment to a result =\r\ndoes not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety regarding whethe=\r\nr the desired result will happen or not will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop =\r\none from operating at one&#39;s best. Decide your actions based on a desired ou=\r\ntcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may not be achieved=\r\n even though your actions seem at this point of time to be the best possibl=\r\ne actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Such a karma yo=\r\ngi is always doing the best possible actions and wasting very little time o=\r\nn worrying about things not in one&#39;s control. It is a very effective strate=\r\ngy materially as well as spiritually!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requires\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sac=\r\nrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures ? Can&#39;t we have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress and material success can co-exist. But spirit=\r\nual progress and attachment to (and worrying about) material success tend t=\r\no pull one in different directions.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Do not see world as a place w=\r\nhere you seek pleasures or enjoyments, but see it mainly as a place where y=\r\nou *give* enjoyment to others. Focus on giving. You may also *receive* plea=\r\nsures in the bargain, but do not strive for it or calculate it or focus you=\r\nr mind on it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What you give now is in your hands. What you get no=\r\nw is in god&#39;s hands and is decided based on what you gave earlier. What you=\r\n give now decides what you will receive later. Spiritual progress essential=\r\nly means realizing this and focusing the mind, its thoughts and actions on =\r\ngiving to the world, rather than receiving. Even as you focus your mind on =\r\ngiving, you will also receive some things. But exactly what they are is bas=\r\ned on what you gave in the past, which is water under the bridge, and hence=\r\n you have no control over it now. This is true irrespective of whether you =\r\nare attached to what you receive or not.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Just keep doing sadhana. My feeling is that you are one of the people=\r\n who will make very good progress in coming years. Rome is not built in a d=\r\nay.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; My intuition strongly tells me that Vishnu homam is the best =\r\nfor you. If you want, you can keep doing occasional Chandi homam like you a=\r\nre doing now. But why don&#39;t you consider replacing the daily Ganapathi homa=\r\nm with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra naama stotra and do homam with it=\r\n.
