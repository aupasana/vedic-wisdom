It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taitta=\r\nriya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar with. Other scrip=\r\ntures refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, wh=\r\nere Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord=\r\n Rama.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understandi=\r\nng is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five c=\r\nhakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ethe=\r\nr, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth el=\r\nement within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effac=\r\ned in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water el=\r\nement within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effac=\r\ned in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, do=\r\nn&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element show=\r\ns a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid stat=\r\ne of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.=\r\ng. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made o=\r\nf earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a=\r\n house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus=\r\n, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks an=\r\nd feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one=\r\n may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, cert=\r\nain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s=\r\n self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini can=\r\nnot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature with=\r\nin one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot=\r\n leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in =\r\nnature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And s=\r\no on.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in high=\r\ner chakras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in =\r\nthose chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experie=\r\nnced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaar=\r\na, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning =\r\nanything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is eff=\r\naced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the=\r\n subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) f=\r\nrom one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not a=\r\nt all easy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progre=\r\nsses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini a=\r\ngain comes down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - eth=\r\ner, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Reg=\r\narding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe r=\r\neality?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross phys=\r\nical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;p=\r\nerceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As a =\r\nsimple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may =\r\n&quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another exampl=\r\ne, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some=\r\n scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived by the =\r\nexternal senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It=\r\n is reasonable to define reality as something that can be perceived by the =\r\nexternal senses, because different people can experience the same reality u=\r\nsing their senses individually and verify the observation. However, some ex=\r\nperiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very=\r\n powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberating influence=\r\n on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback of modern s=\r\ncience.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams a=\r\nnd internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, because th=\r\nere is no independent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. But th=\r\nere are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the following messages=\r\n from the archives.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (mes=\r\nsage 951)\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience that w=\r\nas described in detail and another person seemed to know about it and suppl=\r\nied one tangible detail relating to the experience, suggesting that he too =\r\n&quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyond the ext=\r\nernal senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/391\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In the above mess=\r\nage also, one person had a specific yogic experience that was described in =\r\ndetail and another person seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of =\r\ntangible details relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observ=\r\ned&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external s=\r\nenses of either person!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 24=\r\n98)\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nn the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a=\r\n deity and another person perceived with his external senses a vision invol=\r\nving the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything =\r\nwith their external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; th=\r\ne experience of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do sugges=\r\nt that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by t=\r\nhe external senses are observable by others, though not everyone may be abl=\r\ne to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experienc=\r\nes that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses being a part=\r\n of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But, how can modern scien=\r\nce study it?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied and measu=\r\nred is the reality involving the gross body and its senses, one may suggest=\r\n that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing various pa=\r\nrts of the gross physical body. For example, one can look at the nervous si=\r\ngnals flowing through various parts of the brain and try to correlate them =\r\nwith the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; On the surface, it sound=\r\ns like a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are r=\r\nedundant. Though there is some correspondence between what happens in the c=\r\nausal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-=\r\nto-one mapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would=\r\n be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled using just the gros=\r\ns body!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the house=\r\ns from the road, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular=\r\n house with a lot of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be h=\r\naving a party. People in one particular house with no lights are probably o=\r\nut of town. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how ma=\r\nny people are inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at=\r\n the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous sig=\r\nnals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic thin=\r\ngs, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach =\r\nand study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study =\r\nthat part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unle=\r\nss scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which=\r\n is the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time =\r\npoint, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state complete=\r\nly. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some p=\r\nart of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini=\r\n goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis s=\r\neemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://w=\r\nww.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharu=\r\nn Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some hel=\r\np to you.

Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one res=\r\nulting from the previous and each one resulting in some energy states, whic=\r\nh in the end resulted in 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThere is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. =\r\nI feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional ph=\r\nysics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n This is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAs much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability=\r\n to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is qui=\r\nte half formed. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhere=\r\nd to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of th=\r\ne many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical world=\r\n. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in =\r\nmy humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation =\r\nbetween basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation), =\r\nnon-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-t=\r\nheory of panch-mahabhuta?!..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission o=\r\nf Narasimha, I would like to know more about how exactly you can link these=\r\n two, because I myself with my limited understand fail to see any viable co=\r\nrrelation at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very =\r\nnascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about is the ba=\r\nsic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality? Or does i=\r\nt provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathematics provides=\r\n a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted that everyone knows tha=\r\nt Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everyt=\r\nhing. The day physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing  more l=\r\neft to do. Physics is still quite far away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\nRegards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostuden=\r\nt &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\not sure if I get the thrust of your point.

That too if we are =\r\ndestined to find out we will, or else no.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shi=\r\nva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastr=\r\nostudent@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastros=\r\ntudent@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Order of Creation (of mahabhut=\r\na/tattwa) ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesda=\r\ny, 29 September, 2009, 1:12 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji and others=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Taittiriya Upanishad (http://www.sacred- texts.com/ h=\r\nin/sbe15/ sbe15034. htm), the following is the order of creation (Max Muell=\r\ner interpretation) :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;From that Self 2 (Brahman) sprang et=\r\nher (=C3=83=C2=A2k=C3=83=C2=A2sa, that through which we hear); from ether a=\r\nir (that through which we hear and feel); from air fire (that through which=\r\n we hear, feel, and see); from fire water (that through which we hear, feel=\r\n, see, and taste); from water earth (that through which we hear, feel, see,=\r\n taste, and smell)&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This sounds logical to me in that I ex=\r\npected Akasa to be first and earth to be last. I have heard differing opini=\r\nons though, perhaps in Sanjay Rathji&#39;s Brhat Nakshtra but since I dont have=\r\n the book in front of me, I cant confirm. Do you agree with the interpretat=\r\nion above, if not what is your belief, source and justification?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n\n\n"}}
