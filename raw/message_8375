In some branches of the Adwai=\r\ntha philosophy it is said that Shakti (Durga) is Maya and Avidya. Irony bei=\r\nng that, adherents of these branches were hardly the folks, historically sp=\r\neaking, who chief deity was Ma Durga.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The path that *actually* worsh=\r\niped Her, was/is Tantra, which believes, there is no &quot;Avidya&quot; at all. Brahm=\r\nan/the-state-called-Atman is true, and so is the world of duality which is =\r\nbut a manifestation/projection of that core. In the path of Tantra, which w=\r\nas neither mainstream nor geographically widespread, there was never any re=\r\nstriction to females with respect to sadhana. Not only were women initiated=\r\n, but there were fantastic women of exceptional spiritual caliber, and they=\r\n used to be classified based on the levels they had achieved as &quot;uttara-sad=\r\nhikas&quot;, &quot;bhairavis&quot; and &quot;yoginis&quot;. While mainstream Hinduism was busy burni=\r\nng widows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Tantras boldly declared =\r\nSati-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-system totally, and allowed=\r\n women the status of spiritual preceptors when they could attain certain st=\r\nates. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhairavi who taught him Tan=\r\ntra. The first person to worship\n\n&gt;  UgraTara south of the Vindya Hills was=\r\n the wife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who was initiated into thi=\r\ns worship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has the caliber to teach =\r\na Ramakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act as gurus for average f=\r\nolks? Sure. But then, history does not even record her real name. Why? Beca=\r\nuse, the system of Tantra as well as those who followed the path - both men=\r\n and women - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahminical Hinduism; thus =\r\nthey never gained any popularity, except for the wrong reasons. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n Every worship of Durga that happens anywhere today is India is still a wat=\r\nered-down version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi Homa was first me=\r\nntioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal every rule of Durga =\r\nPuja is from the various Tantric schools. [For example, when creating an id=\r\nol of Durga, the mud has to be collected from 4/5 different places such as =\r\nfrom home of a prostitute, a river-bed, a widow&#39;s house, etc etc.] \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; =\r\n\n\n&gt; So it is not that those who followed the path of Ma Durga never had wom=\r\nen saints. Infact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the=\r\n highest spiritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra its=\r\nelf was never popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like f=\r\nemale foeticide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess =\r\nwas popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - =\r\nwho were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a wo=\r\nman as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras s=\r\ntrictly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the G=\r\noddess. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively i=\r\nt would not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one o=\r\nf Her forms.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; -Regards\n\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Bazeech=\r\na-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n=\r\n\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n\n&gt; Ek baat h=\r\nain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ________________________________\n\n&gt;=\r\n  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM\n\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: K=\r\narmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n\n&gt; =\r\n\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentall=\r\ny while\n\n&gt; &gt; reading, time is running out, who knows when you will reach th=\r\ne\n\n&gt; &gt; cremation ground, chant and chant.

The Atman is sexless, bu=\r\nt the Atman in female form has been treated worse than the Atman in male fo=\r\nrm over the centuries...even today it is being murdered in the womb (female=\r\n foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but=\r\n while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women. I has=\r\nten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How=\r\n outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowed to b=\r\ne initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there mo=\r\nre women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s =\r\nbloody disheartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignorance (=\r\nit&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not bei=\r\nng wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wants to save us, she w=\r\nill have to create in us the\n desire\n\n&gt;  to do japa or whatever. I wash my =\r\nhands of the whole thing.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tel=\r\nl us to chant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Ok rant ove=\r\nr. I&#39;m going to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition=\r\n now.

Allow me to add some perspective to =\r\nit, which may or may-not be helpful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;How outrage=\r\nous that for centuries, and even today, women were not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; allowed to=\r\n be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are=\r\nn&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), an=\r\nd then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; s=\r\ncriptures).&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I assume from your words that you ha=\r\nve been exposed to some standard view-points about Durga, (Avidya/Maya and =\r\nall that stuff). In some branches of the Adwaitha philosophy it is said tha=\r\nt Shakti (Durga) is Maya and Avidya. Irony being that, adherents of these b=\r\nranches were hardly the folks, historically speaking, who chief deity was M=\r\na Durga.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The path that *actually* worshiped Her, was/is =\r\nTantra, which believes, there is no &quot;Avidya&quot; at all. Brahman/the-state-call=\r\ned-Atman is true, and so is the world of duality which is but a manifestati=\r\non/projection of that core. In the path of Tantra, which was neither mainst=\r\nream nor geographically widespread, there was never any restriction to fema=\r\nles with respect to sadhana. Not only were women initiated, but there were =\r\nfantastic women of exceptional spiritual caliber, and they used to be class=\r\nified based on the levels they had achieved as &quot;uttara-sadhikas&quot;, &quot;bhairavi=\r\ns&quot; and &quot;yoginis&quot;. While mainstream Hinduism was busy burning widows alive i=\r\nn the name of some dubious rules, Tantras boldly declared Sati-daha as an a=\r\nbomination, rejected the caste-system totally, and allowed women the status=\r\n of spiritual preceptors when they could attain certain states. One of the =\r\nGurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhairavi who taught him Tantra. The first pe=\r\nrson to\n worship&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  UgraTara south of the Vindya Hills was the wife =\r\nof a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who was initiated into this worship =\r\nby a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has the caliber to teach a Ramakris=\r\nhna, would she not have the caliber to act as gurus for average folks? Sure=\r\n. But then, history does not even record her real name. Why? Because, the s=\r\nystem of Tantra as well as those who followed the path - both men and women=\r\n - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahminical Hinduism; thus they never=\r\n gained any popularity, except for the wrong reasons. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Every worship of Durga that happens anywhere today is India is sti=\r\nll a watered-down version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi Homa was =\r\nfirst mentioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal every rule o=\r\nf Durga Puja is from the various Tantric schools. [For example, when creati=\r\nng an idol of Durga, the mud has to be collected from 4/5 different places =\r\nsuch as from home of a prostitute, a river-bed, a widow&#39;s house, etc etc.] =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So it is not that those who followed the path=\r\n of Ma Durga never had women saints. Infact, they had more women in their f=\r\nolds who were accorded the highest spiritual status than in mainstream Hind=\r\nuism. But since Tantra itself was never popular, neither were these saints =\r\npopular. And things like female foeticide were unheard of in places where t=\r\nhe worship of the Goddess was popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamou=\r\ns worshipers of Ma Kali - who were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, woul=\r\nd never dare to offer a woman as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of=\r\n Her wrath since Tantras strictly forbid harming the female of any specifie=\r\ns for a worshiper of the Goddess. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatme=\r\nnt of women, objectively it would not fall on those whose chief worship was=\r\n of Durga or Kali or one of Her forms.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regard=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Bazeecha-e-atf=\r\nal hain duniya mere aage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1=\r\n080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturd=\r\nay, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liabi=\r\nlity for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbs=\r\np; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;scsa_=\r\ntaker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of al=\r\nl, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; readi=\r\nng, time is running out, who knows when you will reach the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; cr=\r\nemation ground, chant and chant.

Sound advice no doubt.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately Durga is partial to some of her children it =\r\nseems, and not all of us are blessed with the intense desire to chant as yo=\r\nu seem to be. Stop rubbing it in please. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; What is the us=\r\ne of asking us to chant more? Ask her to give us this desire, as she seems =\r\nto have done for you. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Which brings me to ranting a bit =\r\nabout the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexless, bu=\r\nt the Atman in female form has been treated worse than the Atman in male fo=\r\nrm over the centuries...even today it is being murdered in the womb (female=\r\n foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but=\r\n while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women. I has=\r\nten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How=\r\n outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowed to b=\r\ne initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there mo=\r\nre women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s =\r\nbloody disheartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignorance (=\r\nit&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not bei=\r\nng wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wants to save us, she w=\r\nill have to create in us the\n desire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  to do japa or whatever. I wa=\r\nsh my hands of the whole thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chan=\r\nt, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ok rant over. I&#39;m going to control my temper and do some=\r\n Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Who knows when it&#39;s time for the cremat=\r\nion ground?
