I cared very little for the body.\nMy longing for the Divine Mother was so great that I would not eat or sleep.\nI would lie on the bare ground, placing my head on a lump of earth, and cry\nout loudly: &quot;Mother, Mother, why dost Thou not come to me?&quot; I did not know\nhow the days and nights passed away. I used to have ecstasy all the time. I\nsaw my disciples as my own people, like children and relations, long before\nthey came to me. I used to cry before my Mother, saying: &quot;O Mother! I am\ndying for my beloved ones (Bhaktas); do Thou bring them to me as quickly as\npossible.&quot; [p. 208]\n\nAll desires fulfilled\n\nAt that time whatever I desired came to pass. Once I desired to build a\nsmall hut in the Panchavati [**] for meditation and to put a fence around\nit.Immediately after I saw a huge bundle of bamboo sticks, rope, strings and\neven a knife, all brought by the tide in front of the Panchavati. A servant\nof the Temple, seeing these things, ran to me with great delight and told me\nof them. There was the exact quantity of material necessary for the hut and\nthe fence.\n\nWhen they were built, nothing remained over. Everyone was amazed to see this\nwonderful sight. When I reached the state of continuous ecstasy, I gave up\nall\nexternal forms of worship; I could no longer perform them. Then I prayed to\nmy Divine Mother: &quot;Mother, who will now take care of me? I have no power to\ntake care of myself. I like to hear Thy name and feed Thy Bhaktas and help\nthe poor. Who will make it possible for me to do these things? Send me\nsomeone who will be able to do these for me.&quot; As the answer to this prayer\ncame Mathura Babu, [*+] who served me so long and with such intense devotion\nand faith! Again at another time I said to the Mother: &quot;I shall have no\nchild of my own, but I wish to have as my child a pitre Bhakta, who will\nstay with me all the time. Send me such an one.&quot; Then came Rakhal\n(Brahmananda). Those who are my own are parts of my very Self. [p. 209]\n\nDistaste for Worldly conversation\n\nNothing but discourses on God appealed to me at this period. If I heard\nworldly conversation, I would sit in a corner and weep bitterly. When I went\nwith Mathura Babu to Benares, I was sitting with him in the drawing-room\nwhen some friends came in to see him and began to discuss worldly affairs.\n&quot;So much we have gained, so much we have lost.&quot; Hearing this I was in tears\nand cried aloud: &quot;Mother, why hast Thou brought me here? I was much better\noff in the Temple.\n\nI have come to the Holy City to hear only of lust and gold; but there in the\nTemple I did not have to listen to such conversation.&quot; I was at this time\nlike a young boy and so Mathura Babu fulfilled all the desires that arose in\nmy mind. My heart and soul, however, were constantly longing to hear about\nthe Supreme Being. [p. 216]\n\nLonging to hear about the Supreme\n\nI searched for the places where the Holy Scriptures were expounded. There\nwas a Brahmin in the neighborhood who was a great pandit and who had true\nfaith. I used to go to hear him very often. A saint lived near by on the\nbank of the Ganges and I wished to go with this Brahmin to see him; but a\npriest who looked upon the world as a dream discouraged me by saying: &quot;The\nbody of a saint is an earthly cage; what good can one obtain by visiting\nsuch a cage?&quot; I spoke of this to the Brahmin and he replied: &quot;He who thinks\nof God, he who repeats His Holy Name and has renounced everything for the\nsake of the Lord, must not be regarded as an earthly cage. The priest does\nnot know that the form of a devotee is a spiritual form full of Divine\nintelligence.&quot;This Brahmin once asked me why I had thrown away my\nBrahminical thread. I replied: &quot;When the storm of Divine ecstasy overtook my\nheart and soul, it blew away all signs of caste and creed.\n\nAbsolute frankness\n\nDuring this period I was absolutely outspoken. I observed no formality or\netiquette; I was fearless. Once I met a rich Zemindar and asked him: &quot;What\nis our highest duty? Is not the attainment of God our highest duty?&quot; He\nreplied: &quot;We are men of the world; salvation is not for us. When even\nYudhisthira, [**] the purest and most perfect of mortals, had to see\npurgatory in a vision because he had once wavered for half a second from\nabsolute Truth, what can we expect for ourselves?&quot; I could not bear his\nwords and rebuked him sharply, saying: &quot;What kind of man are you that you\nthink of the momentary vision of purgatory?\n\nYou must not think of that, but of Yudhisthira&#39;s truthfulness, forgiveness,\npatience, right discrimination, renunciation, devotion and love for God.&quot;\n\nAt another time I went to see a Zemindar who had the title of Raja, and I\ntold him plainly that I could not call him Raja because he was not really\none. One day I saw a pious Brahmin who was counting his beads on the bank of\nthe Ganges. I stood near him and knew that his mind was not fixed on God but\non earthly things. Immediately I roused him by striking him on the shoulder.\nAt another time Rashmoni, the founder of the Temple, was praying in the\nTemple while I was singing the holy song of the Divine Mother. I perceived\nthat her mind was on worldly objects and instantly I roused her in the same\nmanner. In amazement she folded her hands and remained motionless before me.\nvii [p. 218 & 219]\n\nSource: THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--000e0cd21222eca3600476a92d69\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Days of struggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;I practi=\r\nsed austerities for a long time.
