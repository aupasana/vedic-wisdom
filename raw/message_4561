Whether the priest has accumulated spiritual sakth=\r\ni or not, if he is sincere and has the correct attitude it may be worthwhil=\r\ne.\n\nWhen I do my homam, some times, my son joins and does abhishekam to Shi=\r\nv linga. One day, we went to attend house warming function of my sister and=\r\n I carried my basic stuff for my homam but did not carry Shiv ling. My son =\r\nfelt like joining and he asked if I have the Shiv ling. He was not happy wh=\r\nen I answered in negative and kept argueing that I should have brought it t=\r\noo. I told him, God is every where and he can even treat a stone as Shiv li=\r\nng. I told him, if you are sincere and pure at hearth and assume Shiv is in=\r\nfront of you, Shiv will accept your offering.l Well, I know this is true. I=\r\ns there any place where Shiv is not there? Whether or not, I invoked him or=\r\n not, Shiv or any God for that matter is just by our side. My son, went out=\r\n, found a round shaped stone and did mRtyunjaya mantra japa along with abhi=\r\nshekam. As far he is concerned, he believed me and there are no questions i=\r\nn his mind. When such believe is bestored in your priest, YOU CAN BECOME PU=\r\nRE momentarily and what ever you offer in full trust that god is accepting =\r\nit, is accepted by God. There is no doubt in it.\n\nAs per the impact it crea=\r\nte, what impact you want? If you wanted an impact, they you attempted busin=\r\ness with God. When you do not want any thing in return, then you are alread=\r\ny getting the impact. Otherwise, how, living in this material world, you di=\r\nd not expect any thing for what you do?\n\nThe result, you will get is to imp=\r\nrove your attitude. That WILL happen if you offered sincerely.\n\nThe mytholo=\r\ngy is full of stories that suggest, in complete surrender or otherwise, if =\r\nthe call to God is sincere, God will always answer the same. It is another =\r\nthing if we realized that God has already answered us!\n\nThe very fact, that=\r\n we are finding time to read/write message like this shows that we are tryi=\r\nng to correct our attitude and seek god. This itself is the result of what =\r\never little sadhana we are doing.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sati=\r\nsh Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all i must say that I was happy & impressed to see you=\r\nr message and the honesty with which you went about writing such detailed c=\r\nritique.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Narasimha Garu says that &quot;Accumulated Shakti&quot; is the prima=\r\nry pre-requisite to bring about the specific result of any specific ritual.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; you are of the opinion that It is not so and he is a mere Technician =\r\nwho is expert of performing ritual as prescribed and result is entirely bec=\r\nause of the invoked deity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both the views are correct to me only the s=\r\nubtle understanding is needed. I am of the opinion that if the priest does =\r\nnot posses at least a little spiritual power, He can not invoke deity&#39;s pre=\r\nsence however expert and perfectionist he is in performing a ritual.\n&gt; \n&gt; Y=\r\nes, i agree with you that &quot;Results&quot; are given because Deity is pleased by t=\r\nhe ritual and offerings BUT can a divine deity will even be present if invo=\r\nked by a person who is not capable?. Pleasing of deity is even far away.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; It is well known that Brahamana&#39;s of yore were following very stringent,=\r\n disciplined, Unselfish and God-oriented life. They everyday used to devote=\r\n good amount of time in their personal sadhanas. (I am talking about Majori=\r\nty of them. every Yuga has every yuga present as you correctly said). I thi=\r\nnk, because of that highly evolved life style and off course equipped with =\r\nexpertise of performing various rituals, they were fit to become mediators =\r\nbetween Yajamana and Devata. A real brahmana would therefore capable of inv=\r\noking Devine preence to the best of his ability and get the results for the=\r\n Yajamana.\n&gt; \n&gt; So here i am sure you&#39;ll see point of &quot;caliber&quot; factor for =\r\nperson performing the ritual for &quot;Materialistic Desires&quot; of 3rd party (i.e.=\r\n Yajamana).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) You have mis-understood &quot;Bagging bawl&quot; &quot;Beggars&quot; etc...=\r\n With the term beggars, He basically means most of us who are &quot;Helpless & h=\r\nopelessly Trapped&quot; &quot;Aspirants&quot; who cry to mother for the release.

P=\r\nlease do not take words literally. And in reality, to be blunt, most of us =\r\nare &quot;Beggars&quot;. We pray (beg) for good life, good Job, good Money, good Hous=\r\ne, best of this and best of that and best of all that. we seldomly say to g=\r\nod &quot;without&quot; folded hands that God tussi great Ho.

I will give my 2 cents of views based=\r\n on my experience and\n&gt; &gt; insights. I will be honest, straight-forward and =\r\nblunt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like\n&gt; &gt; me and all others w=\r\nho respect Shri PVR Narsimhaji as a noble, honest,\n&gt; &gt; intelligent, spiritu=\r\nal person and Sanskrit scholar must be feeling sad after\n&gt; &gt; reading conten=\r\nts in the post heading efficacy of astro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npainful to read such thing from a person of his status whom lot of people\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; considered as a good astro-spiritual personality. Though I am not having=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; scripture references i=E2=80=99ll try to post my humble protest and re=\r\nquest to all\n&gt; &gt; members to understand and study shastra deeply for better =\r\nunderstanding. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though believers call priests and get poojas done,=\r\n in the hope that their\n&gt; &gt; problems will be solved, many priests today are=\r\n incapable of producing any\n&gt; &gt; results. As a result, some believers got ac=\r\ncustomed to accepting that a pudding\n&gt; &gt; exists even without eating it and =\r\nremain hungry throughout life. And some\n&gt; &gt; intelligent people stopped beli=\r\neving in god and in remedies. Let me first address\n&gt; &gt; why this has come to=\r\n be and then talk about what we should do. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Results\n&gt; &gt; are produc=\r\ned rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or deity and\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nlessings are called =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [\n&gt; &gt; krupA] Here =\r\nwe think results are produced; so let us understand the method. If\n&gt; &gt; some=\r\nbody wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n perform remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; focal point is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yaja=\r\nmana=E2=80=99s\n&gt; &gt; behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=\r\n=99s desire and in return get\n&gt; &gt; paid. So in this whole exercise priest is=\r\n a mere mediator or a technician who\n&gt; &gt; can interact with both parties. An=\r\nd interaction means correct rituals with\n&gt; &gt; appropriate mantras. So his sp=\r\niritual or mental strength is not required but\n&gt; &gt; his skill and knowledge =\r\nis of prime importance. Can we consider a mortal priest\n&gt; &gt; to bless a yaja=\r\nmana? And if a priest can bless yajamana what is the role of\n&gt; &gt; rituals, m=\r\nantras? The truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the human beings by\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nevatas as only divinity is capable of this. And many times fruits are not\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; received due to karmic blockages of yajamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=\r\n=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=\r\n=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [ in kaliyuga four\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntimes efforts are needed] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for doi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; bhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy\n&gt; &gt; task on =\r\nthe part of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of\n&gt; &gt; yajamana=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check gi=\r\nven by one\n&gt; &gt; for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is=\r\n empty, what good\n&gt; &gt; is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will boun=\r\nce. Similarly, poojas done\n&gt; &gt; and blessings given by a priest without enou=\r\ngh spiritual energy cannot bring\n&gt; &gt; one any benefits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Yajamana get fruits of the rituals from the inbuilt bank balance of de=\r\nities\n&gt; &gt; and not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine energy, called devata=\r\n can give\n&gt; &gt; million dollar check to unlimited no of people as GOD has san=\r\nctioned rather\n&gt; &gt; appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tradition in ve=\r\ndic rituals in any\n&gt; &gt; pooja with or without homa in the beginning there is=\r\n one ritual called\n&gt; &gt; aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means yajamana nominate a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf and in the end befo=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; visarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=\r\n=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is performed\n&gt; &gt; in whi=\r\nch priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to yajamana.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Here we can clearly understand the role of priest and the role of deity. A=\r\ns per\n&gt; &gt; karmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya and blessed=\r\n one get that\n&gt; &gt; share of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can =\r\na mortal though highly\n&gt; &gt; qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he in=\r\nteracts with many in his lifetime?\n&gt; &gt; This could be possible only for high=\r\nly evolved soul like saints and yogis as\n&gt; &gt; due to great penance they do h=\r\nave such powers. But even for them also some time\n&gt; &gt; loss of spiritual ene=\r\nrgy leads for further penance. We read lot of stories in\n&gt; &gt; ancient mythol=\r\nogy of sages enticed by apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if\n&gt; &gt; they =\r\ncursed some body results in renewed penances to regain there status.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One important note: The power is not in a combination of=\r\n syllables (mantra)\n&gt; &gt; or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The pow=\r\ner is in the MIND that\n&gt; &gt; FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) o=\r\nr a sequence of physical\n&gt; &gt; actions (ritual). Energy is generated when min=\r\nd overcomes its tendency to\n&gt; &gt; wander and instead focuses on one thing. Di=\r\nfferent mantras and rituals as the focus\n&gt; &gt; points may generate different =\r\nkinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without\n&gt; &gt; it, no mantra or ritual =\r\nproduces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice.\n&gt; &gt; Most priests are=\r\n just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas.\n&gt; &gt; In the ol=\r\nd days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the\n&gt; &gt; tabl=\r\ne when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=\r\n [ science of pathway to GOD] and\n&gt; &gt; [science of full feeling desires thro=\r\nugh devata] i.e. =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 =C2=A0are two different=\r\n things. This science of\n&gt; &gt; mantra and devata is not easy to understand. D=\r\nivinity is beyond logic and human\n&gt; &gt; mind is not capable to experience it =\r\neasily. As per smruti =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=\r\n=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=9A =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=\r\n=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 is a dictum. We are having four types of\n&gt; &gt; vak [ va=\r\nni]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyantI and parA [=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=96=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80,\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=\r\n=BE, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=\r\n=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE] and last one is the most subtle and\n&gt; &gt; imp. We s=\r\nee picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus which originates from\n&gt; &gt; naval=\r\n of Vishnu indicating creation origin of universe. This is puran based\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nconcept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are having same concept wit=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; different terminology. The subtle seat of paravak is at naval and cre=\r\nator\n&gt; &gt; brahma creates this world with the help of saraswati and sarsawati=\r\n is nothing\n&gt; &gt; but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=\r\n=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of syllables. When =\r\ntwo unknown person meets first\n&gt; &gt; time how they get connected? Through com=\r\nmunication and thought is a form of\n&gt; &gt; vak, pashyanti. First there is desi=\r\nre to know each other and then communication\n&gt; &gt; starts. And in communicati=\r\non if some body express negativity communication\n&gt; &gt; stops. So for communic=\r\nation soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we\n&gt; &gt; assume that m=\r\nantra or rituals are of no importance? These show qualities, tools\n&gt; &gt; nece=\r\nssary to get connected with devatas in right perspective. In scriptures\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt; syllable resulting in typical energy. To be precise power rest wit=\r\nh desire and\n&gt; &gt; mind is a mere tool to channalise that power and strength =\r\nof desire will decide\n&gt; &gt; depth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana=\r\n, mind is of priest and\n&gt; &gt; blessings are from pleased devata. Even in grea=\r\nt astro treaty like BPHS, sage\n&gt; &gt; parAsharA recommended various rituals of=\r\n various devatas for removing bad\n&gt; &gt; effects of bad dashas or bad planetar=\r\ny placements. I wonder if mantra and\n&gt; &gt; rituals do not count why Narsimhaj=\r\ni is having so many homa manuals. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To consider spiritual aspect of=\r\n it, persons like saint or yogis who do have\n&gt; &gt; dharanA like a solid rock =\r\nwho always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not\n&gt; &gt; require mantra or tan=\r\ntra, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can\n&gt; &gt; do work. Norm=\r\nal people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of\n&gt; &gt; pata=\r\nnjali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra,=\r\n tantra,\n&gt; &gt; nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many ma=\r\nny things count. =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0This whole confusion=\r\n is due to\n&gt; &gt; Narsimhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality and=\r\n he is doing this with pure\n&gt; &gt; heart. Yes, focus mind is one of the factor=\r\ns in this whole exercise. Many have\n&gt; &gt; seen shatachandI or mahArudra anush=\r\nathAna where many priest at a time read or\n&gt; &gt; chant mantras with different=\r\n level of mind focus still yajamana get fruits of\n&gt; &gt; it in terms of desire=\r\ns. This is because devata is pleased by offerings, japa\n&gt; &gt; and hOme which =\r\nin turn bless the yajamana with HIS blessings.=C2=A0 For spirituality focus=\r\n, pure heart and\n&gt; &gt; continuous efforts are of prime importance but for get=\r\nting our desires to be\n&gt; &gt; fulfilled we need correct procedure, appropriate=\r\n deity and correct mantra.\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 is a love relationship BTW jiva and parmAtmA=\r\n =E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 =E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=BE =E0=A4=AA=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B0=E0=\r\n=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE; where as =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 or ma=\r\nntrashAshtra is a give and take relationship =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=9E=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=A8\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A4=AE=\r\n=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A4.

In every satyayuga we have kaliyu=\r\nga and that is why\n&gt; &gt; RAVANA a great dashgranthi brahmana ran away with si=\r\ntA. =C2=A0Narsimhaji freely distributing astrology\n&gt; &gt; software, lectures, =\r\nhomA manuals is a satyayuga in kaliyuga. So don=E2=80=99t blame\n&gt; &gt; today=\r\n=E2=80=99s priest; to become perfect in karmakAndA a priest at least give h=\r\nis ten\n&gt; &gt; yeas to become perfect in rituals. In old golden days life was s=\r\nimple, there\n&gt; &gt; was =E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AF and =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=B0=E0=A4=AF to bramhana. Kings have had sanctioned =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=97=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0 [some fertile land] to all pries=\r\nts in old golden\n&gt; &gt; days. =C2=A0And most imp in old golden days\n&gt; &gt; also a=\r\nlways fruits were given by pleased devatas due to offerings, japa,homA\n&gt; &gt; =\r\netc. and not by personal sadhana of priest. BTW, Sadhana of priest was and =\r\nis a\n&gt; &gt; personal advantage due to punyakarma [past birth=E2=80=99s good de=\r\neds] of yajamana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0We must\n&gt; &gt; have gra=\r\ntitude for whole=C2=A0 past\n&gt; &gt; generations =C2=A0for maintaining such a di=\r\nvine\n&gt; &gt; science in oral tradition for thousands of years with such a accur=\r\nacy[ they\n&gt; &gt; know power of syllables, so they maintained sanctity of akash=\r\nrA, =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0- =E0=A4=A8 =E0=A4=95=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BF -\n&gt; &gt; non-perishable ] due to wh=\r\nich we can proclaim ourselves as vedic\n&gt; &gt; astrologers, yoga gurus, vedic h=\r\nealers, vedic mathematicians etc. Yes, we must\n&gt; &gt; mould / change according=\r\n to [ =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B6, =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2, =E0=A4=AA=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 ] =\r\nsurroundings, time and environments but we must not let go real ethics,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n morals, rules of our ancient proved traditions. =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many peopl=\r\ne think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a\n&gt; &gt; trained pri=\r\nest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite\n&gt; &gt; complic=\r\nated over the time too! However, complexity of rituals should never be a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday=\r\n, 40 grams\n&gt; &gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have=\r\n no access to such\n&gt; &gt; balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you fi=\r\nnd a balanced meal or will\n&gt; &gt; you manage with whatever you have? If you ju=\r\nst have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)\n&gt; &gt; and rice,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you will simply =\r\neat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do\n&gt; &gt; not know the =\r\n&quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait\n&gt; &gt; till you know th=\r\ne perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only\n&gt; &gt; give you =\r\nenergy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems f=\r\nrom the\n&gt; &gt; notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion =\r\nis not totally\n&gt; &gt; baseless, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to =\r\nfocus the mind on some\n&gt; &gt; mantras and rituals and get specific results. Wh=\r\nen used by someone with a high\n&gt; &gt; level of spiritual energy, some mantras =\r\nand rituals may work very fast and give\n&gt; &gt; specific powerful results. Howe=\r\nver, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such\n&gt; &gt; things in this age.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and should be d=\r\none by experts only\n&gt; &gt; as these are for special purposes and should be don=\r\ne by trained people. There\n&gt; &gt; are hundreds of ways for GOD realization and=\r\n a single way to fulfill our\n&gt; &gt; desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know how to =\r\ndrive a car why opt for a fighter plane? =C2=A0=C2=A0Only if you elders, gu=\r\nrus have sanctioned it\n&gt; &gt; then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden any=\r\nthing but due to loss of energy\n&gt; &gt; in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc.=\r\n for removing karmic blocks we feel we\n&gt; &gt; need more energy and we are not =\r\ngetting it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect\n&gt; &gt; thing as perfection is =\r\nsubjective matter but we must read study, think, analyze\n&gt; &gt; before accepti=\r\nng any concept. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as\n&gt; &gt; this is o=\r\nne of the best ways for acceleration according to my experiences in my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntwenties but it is for spirituality and for desires to get full filled thro=\r\nugh\n&gt; &gt; deities every thing counts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you=\r\n use, you\n&gt; &gt; may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to s=\r\ntart begging with\n&gt; &gt; some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending y=\r\nears looking for the\n&gt; &gt; perfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting for astro=\r\nlogers with half-baked or\n&gt; &gt; ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfe=\r\nct mantra or ritual, do what your\n&gt; &gt; heart tells you or what your guru (or=\r\n an elder you respect) tells you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; WE, the jIvAs ar=\r\ne not beggars but anshA of GOD. =E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=\r\n=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Human=\r\n being is the best creativity\n&gt; &gt; of HIM, the divine. The sole aim of manus=\r\nhyayOnI is to realize HIM. In this\n&gt; &gt; journey we may face many types of di=\r\nfferent obstacles due to our karma and to\n&gt; &gt; surpass them HE has given us =\r\npower and rights to use our intellect, mind for\n&gt; &gt; healthy, wealthy and pe=\r\naceful life. And whole karma done for this in a pious\n&gt; &gt; manner is a sattv=\r\nic karma. Even for getting fulfilled our desires we do have a\n&gt; &gt; relations=\r\nhip of respect, love, gratitude with devatas. Beggars don=E2=80=99t have an=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; feelings for donors instead they even don=E2=80=99t remember them. We=\r\n are =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF =E0=A4=\r\n=AA=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE; children of\n&gt; &gt; divinity.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, unfortunately there are lot of fake astrologers, gurus etc.=\r\n who are\n&gt; &gt; misguiding people;but again there is satyuga in kaliyuga. And =\r\nfor everybody,\n&gt; &gt; karma counts resulting in happenings of life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva\n&gt; &gt; panchakshari m=\r\nantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha,\n&gt; &gt; Hanuman c=\r\nhalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasa=\r\nkshari\n&gt; &gt; mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare kr=\r\nishna mantra,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, La=\r\nlita sahasranaama\n&gt; &gt; stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work f=\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; are many generic mantras =\r\n(see my original mail at the bottom for a sample list)\n&gt; &gt; that are appliab=\r\nle to everybody and can\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; solve\n&gt; &gt; ALL problems. For example, Vishn=\r\nu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it can\n&gt; &gt; solve ANY problem. Instead=\r\n of looking for a\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;perfect\n&gt; &gt; mantra recommendation&quot;, you can pic=\r\nk a generic mantra like that and start\n&gt; &gt; sadhana. The key is faith and pe=\r\nrsistence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If\n&gt; &gt; your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, sma=\r\nll amount energy may be enough\n&gt; &gt; to move it away. If it is the size of a =\r\nbig\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; boulder\n&gt; &gt; on the other hand, much more energy may be needed.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It\n&gt; &gt; seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to sp=\r\nread concept of homa in this world.\n&gt; &gt; Yes, as this concept is blessed by =\r\ndivine mother homa is going to be popular\n&gt; &gt; sadhana in coming years. In h=\r\nis anxiety to spread this blessing he is\n&gt; &gt; contradicting his own words. M=\r\nantras do have vargabheda and can be broadly\n&gt; &gt; categorized as=C2=A0 shrut=\r\nimantra,\n&gt; &gt; smritimantra, puranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex. We can br=\r\noadly classify savitur\n&gt; &gt; gayatri as shrutimantra; chandipatha as smrutinm=\r\nantra; vishnusahastranam as\n&gt; &gt; puranmantra and shabarimantra[created by gr=\r\neat navanath yogis] as varadamantra.\n&gt; &gt; The term generic is itself illusiv=\r\ne. Every devata, every mantra is assigned\n&gt; &gt; different power, different wo=\r\nrk by cosmic mother. It is HER wish for this\n&gt; &gt; classification. =E0=A4=89=\r\n=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=82 =\r\n=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=A5=E0=A4=82( =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=\r\n=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A5=87 ) =E0=A4=AC=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=\r\n=A4=A3=E0=A5=8B\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE [ For\n&gt; &gt; fulfilling jiva=E2=80=99s desires and=\r\n subsequent karma GOD manifest in different form ]\n&gt; &gt; is the nucleus of al=\r\nl devatabheda and related different forms, mantra, rituals\n&gt; &gt; etc. =C2=A0W=\r\nhy remedies are needed, how they\n&gt; &gt; can give desirable fruits, how can we =\r\nachieve this and last but imp how this\n&gt; &gt; happen should be focal point her=\r\ne. Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by\n&gt; &gt; removing karmic blocks =\r\nwe can get this, by doing various correct procedures we\n&gt; &gt; can achieve thi=\r\ns and this happens due to generated punya in this whole\n&gt; &gt; exercise. For f=\r\null filling desires we should know the depth of karma, to remove\n&gt; &gt; karmic=\r\n blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we must have exact\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntools in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last generation of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; punya in real timeframe. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let us have a quick look at Narsimh=\r\nji=E2=80=99s post on\n&gt; &gt; remedy for begetting a child. He has suggested mai=\r\nn remedy as santangopal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he =\r\nsuggested\n&gt; &gt; that? If every mantra from his generic list can do this he sh=\r\nould have suggested\n&gt; &gt; any one. As per the shashtra the analogy should be =\r\nlike this. Here we will\n&gt; &gt; sidetrack depth of karma as this is near imposs=\r\nible to understand =E0=A4=97=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at leas=\r\nt for me. Consider a\n&gt; &gt; childless couple aged 35 years after ten yeas of m=\r\narriage who desperately need\n&gt; &gt; a baby. Snatangopal is a specific form of =\r\nVishnu [ a mahadeity responsible for\n&gt; &gt; sustenance of universe ] to bless =\r\nchildless with a baby, the mantra itself is\n&gt; &gt; self explanatory as this ai=\r\nms at begetting child and the most imp it will\n&gt; &gt; generate punya in specif=\r\nic timeframe. Yes, every so called generic mantra is\n&gt; &gt; capable of giving =\r\neverything to everybody but the main hurdle is timeframe. If\n&gt; &gt; we do any =\r\nsadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy to have all\n&gt; &gt; pleasures=\r\n in the world whereas the use of this punya depends upon the\n&gt; &gt; individual=\r\n. In this case punya required to beget a child is missing so we need\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat energy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lady will b=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; capable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will give child=\r\n but in\n&gt; &gt; next birth as specific form of punya required to beget a baby w=\r\nill be\n&gt; &gt; accumulated after doing generic mantra for long time rather whol=\r\ne life time. As\n&gt; &gt; said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in=\r\n next birth including\n&gt; &gt; baby and major part of that punya will be consume=\r\nd for said cause of baby\n&gt; &gt; leaving small part for other pleasures. If we =\r\nuse wooden hammer to fix a nail\n&gt; &gt; it might take one hour to finish job bu=\r\nt metal hammer can do this in five\n&gt; &gt; minutes. This science, not logic is =\r\nbehind different mantra, rituals sanctioned\n&gt; &gt; by sages for different purp=\r\noses as karma is never generic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narsihmaji you are doing very=\r\n noble karma in a\n&gt; &gt; sattvic manner so thousands will read you, hundreds w=\r\nill follow you; so for\n&gt; &gt; them and to our scientific spiritual tradition i=\r\n think you should do justice by\n&gt; &gt; rethinking on this topic. I myself read=\r\n your spiritual post with respect but in\n&gt; &gt; this matter you miss the targe=\r\nt. =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n              Yours sincerely\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                    Satish\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
