Tryambaka is the \nname=\r\n of Lord Shiva as the father of the three worlds - bhu, bhuva \nand svarga l=\r\nokas. He is the father and lord of the three mandala&#39;s - \nSurya, Soma and A=\r\ngni mandala. He is Maheswara, the lord of the three \nGuna&#39;s - Satva, Rajas =\r\nand Tamas. He is the Sadashiva, the teacher of \nthe three tatvas - Atma tat=\r\nva, Vidya tatva and Shiva tatva. He is \nthe father (cause and source) of th=\r\ne three energies (agni) - \nAavahaniya, Garhapatya and Dakshinagni. He is th=\r\ne father of all \nphysical creation through the three murti bhuta - Prithvi =\r\n(solid), \nJala (liquid) and Tejas or agni (energy). He is the lord of the \n=\r\nthree heavens created by the dominance of the three Gunas - Rajas \n(Brahma)=\r\n, Satva (Vishnu) and Tamas (Shiva). Know Him to be the \nnirakara (formless)=\r\n Sadashiva as He is above this physical mode and \nis their Maheswara. This =\r\nis the first foot of the mantra (composed \nof eight syllables).&quot;\n\n&quot;The seco=\r\nnd pada of the mantra,&quot; continued Sukracharya, &quot;is  \nSugandhim Pushtivardha=\r\nnam. Sugandhim refers to the fragrance of the \nflower that spreads in all d=\r\nirections, and in a similar way Shiva is \npresent in the entire creation, b=\r\noth animate and inanimate. In all \nthe bhutas (modes of existence), in the =\r\nthree Gunas (nature of \ncreation as being Satva, Rajas or Tamas), in the te=\r\nn indriyas (five \ngyana-indriyas or senses and five karma-indriyas or organ=\r\ns of \naction), in all the devas (33 devas are the source of all \nilluminati=\r\non and enlightenment) and the ganas (hosts of demi-gods),  \nShiva exists an=\r\nd pervades as the illumine atma (soul) and is their \nessence. Pustivardhana=\r\nm is now being explained. That inward dwelling \nspirit (atman), the Purusha=\r\n Shiva is the real sustainer of Prakriti \n(and not vice-versa as all people=\r\n perceive). Starting with the \nmahatatva (primordial state of matter/energy=\r\n) to the individual \nparts of creation, the entire sustenance of the physic=\r\nally created \nbeings (both animate and inanimate) is done by the imperishab=\r\nle \nPurusha. You, I, Brahma, Vishnu, the Munis and even Indra & devas \nare =\r\nmaintained/sustained (by the atma and that is Him). Since the \nPurusha (atm=\r\na - Shiva) is the granter of sustenance to prakriti \n(body/nature), he is &#39;=\r\nPusti-vardhana&#39;.&quot;\n\nHaving explained the first two pada of the mantra, Sukra=\r\ncharya \ncontinued to explain the remaining two pada. He said &quot; the next two=\r\n \npada (consisting of sixteen syllables) is  Urvarukamiva Bandhanam \nMrityo=\r\nrmukshiya mamritat meaning - Prabhu! just as the ripe cucumber \nis severed =\r\nfrom the bondage of the creeper, in the same manner may \nwe be delivered fr=\r\nom death for the sake of immortality (moksha). \nRudra deva is like amrita (=\r\nnectar of immortality). Those who worship \nHim with good karma, penance and=\r\n repentance, meditation, \ncontemplation, prayer or praise, will surely rene=\r\nwed life and vigor. \nThe strength of truth force (in this mantra) is such t=\r\nhat Lord Shiva \nshall definitely free the worshipper from the bondage of de=\r\nath \nbecause Shiva alone is the giver of bondage and moksha. \n\nThis is the =\r\nMritasanjivani mantra and has the power to give back \nlife and rescue from =\r\ndeath and great evils. You should adore Lord \nShiva and recite this mantra.=\r\n Water sanctified with this mantra \nshould be drunk all the time. [Authors =\r\nnote: It is well known that \nthe rudraksha bead is placed in a glass of wat=\r\ner after being held in \nthe palm during the recitation of the mantra. this =\r\nwater is drunk \nduring the day.]\n\nOblations in the sacrificial fire with th=\r\nis mantra is very \npurifying. Now I shall teach the dhyana for the mantra.&quot;=\r\n Saying so, \nSukracharya started reciting the shlokas for meditating on Lor=\r\nd \nShiva.&#39;\n\nTrust this is also available for the general viewing and clarit=\r\ny for \nthe members of the Group\n\nThank you all for providing your valuable =\r\nview on the matter and \nenligten me on the subject\n\nGanesh Gulati\n\n\n\n"}}
