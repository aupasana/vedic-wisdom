That was a means of self pres=\r\nervation which in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a m=\r\nore sublime path - IMHO -=C2=A0than that which comes from the Ahadiths and =\r\nthe Koran proper.\n=C2=A0\nFor example Rumi talks a about something similar t=\r\no=C2=A0reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one does talk=\r\n about communion with God:\n=C2=A0\nI searched for God among the Christians a=\r\nnd on the Cross and therein I found Him not.\nI went into the ancient temple=\r\ns of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.\nI entered the mountain cave of Hi=\r\nra and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\nWith set purpose I =\r\nfared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitati=\r\non.\nThen I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; Go=\r\nd was not there even.\nTurning to philosophy I inquired about him from ibn S=\r\nina but found Him not within his range.\nI fared then to the scene of the Pr=\r\nophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39;=\r\n distance from him&quot; but God was not there even in that exalted court.\nFinal=\r\nly, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nCommunion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. T=\r\nhe creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Ku=\r\nfr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my int=\r\nerpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Isla=\r\nmic garb. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThe person who changed the life of Rumi was also a=\r\nnother Sufi called=C2=A0 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular le=\r\ngend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One da=\r\ny the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to=\r\n a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happen=\r\ned. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my =\r\nname, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him f=\r\nor doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah =\r\nas per true Islam - and executed him.\n=C2=A0\nSame was with case with Mansur=\r\n-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means =\r\nI am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional I=\r\nslam. \n=C2=A0\nAuliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaal=\r\nis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lor=\r\nd Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.\n=C2=A0\nGenerally, except for the=\r\n famous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis=\r\n saint. \n=C2=A0\nThough Sufis always showed a different more subjective inte=\r\nrpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled.=\r\n Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not =\r\nblame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell you in=\r\n no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God commu=\r\nnion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ails I=\r\nslam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional and a=\r\nuthentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n=C2=A0\nBTW, Sufi ideas are qui=\r\nte famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual high=\r\ner middle class.

Vimalananda mentions a popular legend whic=\r\nh says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mul=\r\nlas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead b=\r\nody and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tr=\r\nied a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wak=\r\ne up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing =\r\nKufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per tr=\r\nue Islam - and executed him.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Same was with cas=\r\ne with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which lit=\r\nerally means I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per =\r\ntraditional Islam. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Auliya Nizamuddin was anot=\r\nher great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India. It is said he had advised t=\r\nhe mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva for a son before Shivaji was bor=\r\nn.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Generally, except for the famous&nbsp;Moinu=\r\nnddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis saint. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Though Sufis always showed a different more subjective =\r\ninterpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never foo=\r\nled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do =\r\nnot blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell yo=\r\nu in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God c=\r\nommunion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ai=\r\nls Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional a=\r\nnd authentic version of Islam is to be followed.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find the =\r\nfashionably spiritual higher middle class. But like most things under the s=\r\nun, they hardly know anything about anything.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN=\r\n style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of cons=\r\nciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/S=\r\nTRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic=\r\n_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT:=\r\n rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.c=\r\nom&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Poetry of Bulle Shah - Sufi&lt;BR&gt;To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursday, 19 November, 2009, 5:21 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv798850465&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;Some years back this specific poem of Baba Bul=\r\nle Shah - a sufi &gt;mystic&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;can you provid me knowledge of this Sufi=\r\n sect. is it one of the branch from Islam?.
