The only major point where I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion on translation=\r\n of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some unnecessary =\r\nconfusion. A few pointers:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.\tThere are various sacred chants embedded=\r\n within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants=\r\n can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotr=\r\nas too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras.  The Samhita portion of=\r\n the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2.\tUndoubtedly mantras and =\r\nstotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is not ev=\r\nen comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.\tWh=\r\nilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes=\r\n a distinction between them.\n&gt;      \n&gt; 4.\tAs per the traditional view one d=\r\noesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not t=\r\nhe same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, =\r\nmantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Ma=\r\nntras from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that ne=\r\ned initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. W=\r\nhatever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are in=\r\ntegral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initia=\r\ntion, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 5.\tVishnusaha=\r\nsranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they=\r\n fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are =\r\ntraditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a=\r\n larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them with=\r\nout initiation is not recommended especially when the reader combines the n=\r\navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.\n&gt;      =\r\n      \n&gt; 6.\tI know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to bot=\r\nh Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the s=\r\nadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSH=\r\nARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) =\r\nof the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to be=\r\n initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 7.=\r\n\tRecapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an in=\r\ndependent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a M=\r\nahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upa=\r\nnishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant =\r\nit. However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth a=\r\nspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular h=\r\nas been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original along with the=\r\n navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case=\r\n it is recommended to be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas =\r\nproperly under guidance.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 8.\tArguably if an uninitiated person reads t=\r\nhe Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approa=\r\nch and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our times.  The pr=\r\noblem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (=\r\nwithout initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting=\r\n the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too =\r\ncontain the bijaksharas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 9.\tI you carefully peruse my write-up on the=\r\n Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mant=\r\nra even in writing. Neither have I attempted to write a commentary on it. T=\r\nranslations of mantras do not have the power of the original mantra as Sabd=\r\na or Vak. However it is recommended to know the essence or import (artha) o=\r\nf the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the impor=\r\nt, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! \n&gt; \n&gt; 10.\tFor those who are alr=\r\neady doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no need to worr=\r\ny or be confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara to be attract=\r\ned to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be=\r\n doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are=\r\n doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has ri=\r\nghtly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for an=\r\ny favours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potenti=\r\nal problem. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. Lea=\r\nve the rest to the compassionate Goddess.              \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope the above=\r\n pointers help in clearing any confusion.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Satya Prakash  =\r\n              \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; &gt; I w=\r\nant to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; &gt; When Swamigal was staying in a c=\r\namp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the\n&gt; &gt; learned persons male and f=\r\nemale alike\n&gt; &gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in =\r\nkannada language\n&gt; &gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSwamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in the morning.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were over as usual Postman ca=\r\nme to\n&gt; &gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; &gt; in front of the learned members =\r\nand was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; &gt; Code and followed by six num=\r\nbers. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; &gt; explain the meaning of PIN C=\r\node and no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; &gt; understood the significanc=\r\ne of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; &gt; member to pick up one LI=\r\nFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and read\n&gt; &gt; the meaning as POSTA=\r\nL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that even the meaning\n&gt; &gt; of PINCode was =\r\nnot known to the group and still it serves the purpose and\n&gt; &gt; people are u=\r\nsing it in day to day work. Similarly not knowing the meaning of\n&gt; &gt; Vishnu=\r\n Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of chanting the stothsram\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwas he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring some clue to our\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndiscussion forum\n&gt; &gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Oct 26, 2010 a=\r\nt 9:10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste G=\r\nirish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not at all against knowing the meaning, so that one=\r\n can immerse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oneself in what one is chanting. That is definitely the =\r\nideal situation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is t=\r\nhat reading something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being even without unde=\r\nrstanding the meaning is very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not unders=\r\ntand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it =\r\nextols Ganapathi as the source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sen=\r\nse of surrender to Ganapathi. One can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one=\r\n is not experiencing anything, it is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one does not=\r\n have the correct attitude and surrender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably not because one=\r\n does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many pe=\r\nople knowing the meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important la=\r\nyers are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of meaning ar=\r\ne never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a cal=\r\nm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep =\r\na target\n&gt; &gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense=\r\n of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender =\r\nto the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra i=\r\ns calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thought=\r\ns and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one of those thousand activities=\r\n, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subside and mind is essential=\r\nly reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical=\r\n vibration is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind,=\r\n the thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind e=\r\ntc. Some mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (ess=\r\nentially beings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such th=\r\nat the physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can eventually cause the corr=\r\nesponding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when other mental activit=\r\ny subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calming the mind dow=\r\nn, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in your mind=\r\n. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; key is =\r\nto attain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sant Dnya=\r\nneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s =\r\nHindi compositions have a power of their own, as they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realized s=\r\nouls.

When I floated the idea, Manish discourag=\r\ned me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could=\r\n be considered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that the goal of sadhana, such a=\r\ns homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras and prayers, is NOT just an int=\r\nellectual understanding of what they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean. They are tools to silence =\r\nthe mind and channel its energy. They are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti =\r\nleft by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding may help facilitate=\r\n the right mood, right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even wit=\r\nhout it, a mantra that was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis h=\r\nolds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi t=\r\nhat one cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can be more effective for sp=\r\niritual progress, than the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person that one can inte=\r\nllectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying abou=\r\nt whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming =\r\nfrom great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playi=\r\nng cricket, a batsman may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to =\r\nplay shots, how to see the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to m=\r\nove feet, how get into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a st=\r\nraight bat, when to play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. B=\r\nut that does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; batsman. If one practice=\r\ns, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basic understandi=\r\nng of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more importa=\r\nnt than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some =\r\nconceptual understanding is important in spirituality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also, but above=\r\n that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essen=\r\nce of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very si=\r\nmple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thi=\r\nngs and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the notions =\r\nof &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc=\r\n. Though this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one =\r\nmay be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic formula to internal=\r\nize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doin=\r\ng&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one pra=\r\nctices a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand, that is =\r\nok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back of one&#39;=\r\ns mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own t=\r\nhoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fi=\r\nne to read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual p=\r\neople (physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. B=\r\nut that will only create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical understanding. For it to be in=\r\nternalized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions=\r\n, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhan=\r\na without a basic theoretical understanding of what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what and what =\r\nwe want, is like a blind person running around a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of=\r\n climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theoreti=\r\ncal understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regardin=\r\ng the statement that initiation is important in tantric path but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not =\r\nin Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncontinuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The iss=\r\nue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific m=\r\naterial results needs to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-=\r\narrangement of karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It r=\r\nequires supervision of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On t=\r\nhe other hand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results an=\r\nd is looking for spiritual progress, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and op=\r\ntions more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a=\r\n notion that Tantrik path is for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results =\r\nand Vedic path is for self-realization. That is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect. After all,=\r\n one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; victory in litigat=\r\nion or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, one in th=\r\ne Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to re=\r\ninforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental rep=\r\nulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a spec=\r\nific material result,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and supervision, which =\r\nnot many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual =\r\nprogress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your surrender, you can just keep doing s=\r\nadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of scripture=\r\ns and other like-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, =\r\nif you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directions =\r\nand some supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can k=\r\neep walking towards north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ntoo, but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that m=\r\nake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ &lt;vedic_pathak%4=\r\n0yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to r=\r\nead in English or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language is because understandi=\r\nng the meaning and &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one re=\r\npeatedly reads the &gt;text in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its u=\r\nnderstandable.

Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from interne=\r\nt forums due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I in=\r\nteracted on an internet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded=\r\n a copy of the original post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with my write up to my inbox, I visited =\r\nthis forum and quickly browsed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through some posts. I am happy to note=\r\n that the general atmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; far better and more sincere than=\r\n a lot of other forums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; browsed through this particula=\r\nr thread, I thought that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important ques=\r\ntion regarding the necessity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it after s=\r\nummarizing the big picture that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to under=\r\nstand the ONE question and the MANY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the =\r\nquestion a general or specific one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the questio=\r\nn is whether initiation is an absolute\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life=\r\n or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the question is about the=\r\n necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tant=\r\nra marga*, the answer is =C2?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nnecessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there ar=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question=\r\n I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the dis=\r\ncussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advait=\r\nic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti ma=\r\nrga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual pa=\r\nth and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spi=\r\nritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; abstract=\r\n Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmethods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths a=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant metho=\r\nds/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nspeaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct=\r\n path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and V=\r\nichara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of =\r\nthe Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; =\r\n(regular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of th=\r\nese practices\n&gt; &gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role fo=\r\nr external practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marg=\r\na emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice) and Vaira=\r\ngya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga additio=\r\nnally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Sup=\r\nreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis=\r\ne only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises uncondit=\r\nional acceptance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supr=\r\neme. On the contrary the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advo=\r\ncated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Engaging in actions without attachment to=\r\n the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of =\r\nmantra sadhana where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and=\r\n thereby the necessity of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the =\r\npracticalization of certain occult\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truths via the energetics of Sabda=\r\n through the employment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presupposes certain dangers inhere=\r\nnt to any lab experiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain regulations and safe pra=\r\nctices. It should be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga most paths i=\r\nnvoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predominantly invo=\r\nkes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Amon=\r\ng the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fire of th=\r\ne intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; austerit=\r\ny, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with =\r\nthe fire of Vak through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Ta=\r\nntra employs highly powerful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques that bring results more quick=\r\nly it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not about authorit=\r\ny but more about qualification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you allow a child to experiment=\r\n with fire without any supervision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experien=\r\nce and training or not? Like any other lab\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment proper training=\r\n and experience are part of the procedure apart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from certain safety m=\r\neasures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s =\r\nown consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within=\r\n the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAs this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri=\r\n Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric co=\r\nntext too. Sakti sadhana is one major river\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the Tantric contex=\r\nt. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensiv=\r\nely. However there are actually three major schools\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are full-fle=\r\ndged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula a=\r\nnd Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vi=\r\ndya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those w=\r\nho are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the th=\r\ne 21 forms of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlo=\r\nok as well as the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni =\r\n(not that Soma is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly in=\r\nvokes Soma, at least at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal spiritua=\r\nl journey. The yantra, mantra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consistently=\r\n of a particular set of synchronistic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these t=\r\nhree lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entry of the practition=\r\ner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru =\r\nparampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself at th=\r\ne root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sub-branches and =\r\ntwigs spread out progressively downward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka. =\r\nIt is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me=\r\ntaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine m=\r\nany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tre=\r\ne of live wires, where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in =\r\nsilent practice all the way up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; till Siva himself. It is a dynamic wor=\r\nld of Light (Prakasa) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana=\r\n seeks to awaken Sakti within the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual consciousness through an=\r\n integrated approach that combines the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bh=\r\nava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into hig=\r\nhly comprehensive and integrated approaches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that can simultaneously h=\r\nold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starts with the Pau=\r\nranic approach. However it is also a full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic t=\r\next like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Yogasast=\r\nra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevant on=\r\nly to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as =\r\na mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, S=\r\nri Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections=\r\n through its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the=\r\n crowning glory in the text is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself=\r\n proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fashion that She is one withou=\r\nt a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; universe. Who else is there=\r\n besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakyas of the Upa=\r\nnishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in Engl=\r\nish or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other regional language is because understanding the meani=\r\nng and constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly read=\r\ns the text in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow. The main idea of=\r\n the writeup is to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too=\r\n apart from its obvious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi=\r\n is also equally regarded as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especial=\r\nly the four hymns. In that regard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the applications of Veda mantra=\r\ns or the Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and he=\r\nnce the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the=\r\n original Vedic method will straightaway\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identify that Yagnya is the =\r\ncentral Vedic practice. In fact even the worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in th=\r\ne Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on one mappin=\r\ng of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part=\r\n of Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, the=\r\nre are those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as=\r\n per the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; marga. It is this particular approach that needs init=\r\niation as per its own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one =\r\nadopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of =\r\nAbhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pauranic approach of reading the te=\r\nxt devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one=\r\n is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagny=\r\na. One may benefit from any or all of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Cha=\r\nndi. However one has to bear in mind that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; living and breathing tr=\r\naditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practiced originally =\r\nin various parts of the subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to T=\r\nantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paths, b=\r\ne it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa=\r\n etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are all effective. However depending on the individual temperame=\r\nnt, aptitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively t=\r\no different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a combination of =\r\nany of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* in=\r\ntegrated approach of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this =\r\nbig picture against which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to be contex=\r\ntualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word=\r\n. Irrespective of the method and path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are th=\r\ne most effective methods for all of us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-stu=\r\ndy of texts followed by reflection on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truths expounded in the tex=\r\nts. This is best done in a language that one is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fully conversant with=\r\n. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; among all methods.=\r\n Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful) where Sat=\r\nsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone that enab=\r\nles one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna att=\r\nained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, listening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to and s=\r\npending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nVivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nivr=\r\nittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays,=\r\n I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;T=\r\nhere is a complaint by householders nowadays that there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are no good M=\r\nahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question o=\r\nf supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nme at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happy=\r\n-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossi=\r\nping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of pas=\r\nsion, greed,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get g=\r\nood Satsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come=\r\n to me. I shall take you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will =\r\nput you in the right path, guide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime heigh=\r\nts. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of the ri=\r\nght type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers are few=\r\n. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also =\r\nbring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //=\r\nUNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent eve=\r\nn this forum is an opportunity for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satsangha. Conducted with the appr=\r\nopriate bhavana, this group too is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; potential Satsangha though not c=\r\nomparable to the actual company of the great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; masters. By swadhyaya of=\r\n Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; study of the live=\r\ns of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listening a=\r\nnd/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; con=\r\nstant remembrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ngenuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes progress=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I may not interac=\r\nt regularly or reply at least for a while.

However, one without a rich fathe=\r\nr is still better off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a zero balance and =\r\nbuilding it up slowly with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not fi=\r\nnding a guru can still do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s=\r\n own spiritual account. If you find a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a =\r\nformality, but truly initiate you), get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go=\r\n ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) =\r\nMantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting speci=\r\nfic material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and ma=\r\nking spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nimportant. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, the=\r\nre are very few people who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabil=\r\nized the whole system, for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest do=\r\ning mantras and rituals only for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatev=\r\ner material results god wants to give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. =\r\nIf one is meant to do rituals for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *specific* material resul=\r\nts (for oneself or others or society/universe in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general), Nature wil=\r\nl make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such rituals.=\r\n But, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chand=\r\nipath or any mantra or any ritual or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitu=\r\nde of &quot;I have several material desires, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulf=\r\nil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; material results or=\r\n spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will acce=\r\npt whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrender a=\r\nnd make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; req=\r\nuired. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but the=\r\nre are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may=\r\n be some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a pe=\r\nrson is taking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in=\r\n garbage and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under them. If th=\r\ne person is gentle, one may do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten f=\r\nruits on the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one =\r\nmay do it fast and there may be more spillage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on the=\r\n floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits will be retr=\r\nieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basket. The dei=\r\nty is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give yo=\r\nu a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lik=\r\ne Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fru=\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creations,=\r\n but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take s=\r\nome of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits is better off avoiding fierce de=\r\nities such as Chandi and staying with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation =\r\nif made mandatory, one can be assessed by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru before starting a pr=\r\nactice. If you realize the above, you can start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras without initi=\r\nation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it is a fr=\r\nuit of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good re=\r\nsults. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in =\r\ntheir life and were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. S=\r\nome people who took several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours to read Saptashati for the first ti=\r\nme just 2-3 years back are now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with entire saptash=\r\nati everyday. I know that some of them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and hav=\r\ne experienced some things too.
