Whenever =\r\ni \n&gt; found somebody struggeling with life & death, i have used this \n&gt; mant=\r\nra. I know 2 specific cases for whom i recited this mantra, \none \n&gt; was a c=\r\nancer patient and other was in very critical condition due \nto \n&gt; grave bik=\r\ne-truck accident. i am happy to note that both are alive. \n&gt; (its not that =\r\nbecause of my recitation-; )\n&gt; i&#39;ve a faith in this mantra and instinctivel=\r\ny recite when somebody \n&gt; is in serious physical trouble.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recite &quot;ba=\r\nndhanaat&quot; -\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, shri Sanjay rath has given a meaning in his bo=\r\nok on \n&gt; vedic remedies.\n&gt; \n&gt; wish you all a very happy Ramkrishna Birth da=\r\ny (english date wise)\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot; \n&gt; &lt;waspieswaspies@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry to encroach upon this thread. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I w=\r\nould like to share something about the miraculous \nMahaMrityunjay\n&gt; &gt; mantr=\r\na. I have always come across different variations in the\n&gt; &gt; pronounciation=\r\n of the MahaMrityunyay mantra, more specifically \nin \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; word &#39;Bandh=\r\nanaan&#39; . I have heard it being pronounced as &#39;Aum \n&gt; Tryambakam\n&gt; &gt; Yajamah=\r\ne...Urvarukm iva Bandhanaam&#39;, &#39;Bandhanaat&#39; \nand &#39;Bandhanaan&#39; . \n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; hav=\r\ne no clue as to what part of the Rig Veda to look for - to \n&gt; verify\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne correct sanskrit word. So, I have always pronounced it with a\n&gt; &gt; silent =\r\n&#39;aan&#39; at the end just because it &#39;felt&#39; right. (Still \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if it=\r\n&#39;s right) But it has nevertheless, always produced\n&gt; &gt; positive results esp=\r\necially in regard to curing illnesses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Such is the generosity of t=\r\nhe Lord! :) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Har Har Mahadev!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com, Jitendra Trivedi \n&lt;trivedijv@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Aji=\r\nt Bhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pranaam and thankyou for the wonderful explanation of =\r\nthe \nMantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari Om Harr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jitu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On We=\r\nd, Feb 18, 2009 at 1:05 PM, gulatiganesh \n&gt; &lt;gulatiganesh@ &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Shri Ajit Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks f=\r\nor the reply and elaborately explaining the meaning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesh=\r\n Gulati\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &lt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom% 40yahoogroups. com&gt;, Ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishnan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;ajit.krishnan@ &gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I&#39;m deluding =\r\nmyself, but I see a strong similarity \n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and the savitur gayatri. The words in the first half of \nthis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nantra, and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first two padas of the gayatri have a strong \ncorr=\r\nespondence. \n&gt; It is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a potent mantra which will=\r\n provide true spiritual \nupliftment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a translat=\r\nion based on the commentary of the Rishi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shaunaka -- We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nray to the eye of all three. (i.e. sadAshiva, who is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progenitor=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brahma, vishnu and rudra). He has the sweet fragrance \n&gt; (ear=\r\nned by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the punya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of his good works). He nourishes us (by =\r\nproviding us with \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shakti that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; underlies the entire c=\r\nosmic creation). (Through his \ngrace,) \n&gt; we are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; from death (i.e. samsara, the cycle of life and death) and \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (sAyujya) mokSha, just as the cucumber detaches itself \n=\r\nfrom \n&gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadIyaH,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
