But by sharing this information there \nmay be oth=\r\ners that upon investigation may agree too.\n\nI am only talking about babaji =\r\nthat is mentioned in Paramhans\nyogananda&#39;s book and lahiri mahashaya&#39;s guru=\r\n. I am not claiming all \nthese babajis are same and one.\n\nAs you have indic=\r\nated babaji is a very common name and you are very \ncorrect about both the =\r\ninstances that you have mentioned, I am \nfamilair with both. There is one g=\r\nentlemen I believe in Canada\nhaving blessings of babaji that you have menti=\r\noned in the south india \nand he has also tried to articulate the lineage, H=\r\ne also does Kriya \nyoga classes. But Introductory Kriya Yoga like Babaji is=\r\n very common \nform of yoga that many teachers are today teaching everywhere=\r\n.\n\nThe other very popular form that everybody talks about but have very \nli=\r\nttle knowledge is the Kundalini Yoga, awakening of Kundalini and \nChakra Bh=\r\nedan.\n\nI had read his book in the past too. The other (Hariakhan) babaji \nt=\r\nhat you mention he actually follows the lord shiva bhairav lineage. \n\nInfac=\r\nt over and above the two that you have mentioned, I have heard \nof one more=\r\n, Swami Rama who lived in USA and has ashram in the north \neast, his guruji=\r\n was also known as babaji and lived in the North \nIndia and Tibet. He is ye=\r\nt another babaji.\n\nThese books that I have read and mentioned were publishe=\r\nd some years \nago, yes I agree this is the way Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s Guru deci=\r\nded to \nact, how can I articulate what he wanted.\n\nBut if you go to india a=\r\nnd visit Phuskar, he has a samadhi and you \ncan ask anybody their or visit =\r\nRajkot Gujarat and you can read the \nbooks for yourshelf. I believe the aut=\r\nhor of the book if alive may be \nstaying in bombay.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt; \nwrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; With all due respect (and emphasizing again that there is no\n&gt; disrespe=\r\nct intended), there are numerous claimants to the Babaji\n&gt; title. Some folk=\r\ns have concluded that he was born as &quot;Nagraj&quot; in\n&gt; Southern India around 20=\r\n0AD (to the extent that the author of the \nbook\n&gt; that makes this claim goe=\r\ns so far as to also claim to have uncovered\n&gt; the temple where he was born =\r\n1800 years ago), few others claim\n&gt; Hariakhan Baba was actually the Babaji =\r\nreferred to in Paramahamsa\n&gt; Yogananda&#39;s book etc; and plenty of others mak=\r\ne similar claims about\n&gt; who Babaji was/is that I will skip for the sake of=\r\n brevity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda unequivocally states in his &quot;Autobiogr=\r\naphy of \na\n&gt; Yogi&quot;; and I quote\n&gt; &quot;That there is no historical reference to=\r\n Babaji need not surprise \nus.\n&gt; The great guru has never openly appeared i=\r\nn any century; the\n&gt; misinterpreting glare of publicity has no place in his=\r\n millennial \nplans&quot;\n&gt; &lt;...&gt;&lt;followed by&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No limiting facts about Babaji&#39;=\r\ns family or birthplace, dear to the\n&gt; annalist&#39;s heart, have ever been disc=\r\novered. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be rather surprising to find out that the Divine Ma=\r\nster \nchose\n&gt; not to reveal his history for centuries to anyone, including =\r\nthe\n&gt; Spiritual Masters of his lineage; and later on chose to &quot;come out&quot;, \n=\r\nso\n&gt; to speak, in a public manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another point to note is that there=\r\n is no mention by anyone of such \na\n&gt; remarkable Divine person in any text =\r\n*prior* to the revelation by\n&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda in his book, followed =\r\nby numerous revelations \nby\n&gt; a multitude of people till date, including fo=\r\nlks today who claim to \nbe\n&gt; &quot;direct&quot; disciples of the Master.\n&gt; \n&gt; That sa=\r\nid, it hardly matters who He was in regular life, instead \nlets\n&gt; agree tha=\r\nt we are talking about a Divine Master indeed. Also, that a\n&gt; lot of the hi=\r\nghly spiritually evolved souls since then have met or\n&gt; received blessings/=\r\nvisions of the Deathless Guru is a given; after\n&gt; all, there is some amount=\r\n of Babaji in them in the form of \nDivinity, no?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; ./Dinesh\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Recently I saw some postings and thought I would share s=\r\nome \n&gt; &gt; information about Paramhans Yogananda&#39;s lineage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many alr=\r\neady know that Swamiji&#39;s ( Paramahans Yogaanda) was a \ndirect \n&gt; &gt; disciple=\r\n of Shri Yukteshwar Maharaj a disciple of Shri Lahiri \n&gt; &gt; Mahashaya.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; As per his book Lahiri Mahashaya was a disciple of Babaji.\n&gt; &gt; Babaji l=\r\nived in India in physical body till 1973. He took\n&gt; &gt; Maha samadhi in Bomba=\r\ny and his Samadhi is located in Phuskar \n&gt; &gt; Rajasthan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Babaji is =\r\nalso know as Ranchod Dasji Maharaj, Paramhans of \nChirtakut \n&gt; &gt; and some m=\r\nore names too.

Paihari Baba was Gujarati by birth but spoke in Hindi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P=\r\naihari Baba lived in Kulu for a long time, than in Pushkar, he \nwas \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\n Pushkar when the temple of Srinathji was moved from Mathura to \n&gt; &gt; Rajast=\r\nhan. At that time he did a lot of seva of lord Krishna in \n&gt; &gt; Pushkar. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; After that he lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. \n&gt; &gt; Babaji also=\r\n lived in Galtaji for about 12 years and he had the \nvision \n&gt; &gt; of Lord Ra=\r\nma in the same cave, that exists today too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is located a few mi=\r\nles from Jaipur, there are a few temples \nthere \n&gt; &gt; near the cave. I have =\r\nvisited this cave too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa a=\r\nnd than to Kashmir \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; he lived in a place called &quot;Rasayani Gufa&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Paihari Baba also may have lived for 500 plus years too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nWhile at Galtaji, the Famous Tulsidas maharaj had visited Paihari \n&gt; &gt; Baba=\r\n and give a hand written manuscipt of Ramayana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They belong to the=\r\n Ramanandi Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and \nGoddess \n&gt; &gt; Sita devi as ishta=\r\n devata.
