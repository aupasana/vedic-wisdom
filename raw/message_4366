Doing homam with a small fire usin=\r\ng 3-4 small dry coconut pieces is also definitely good and useful, but doin=\r\ng homam with a bigger fire has a stronger effect on one&#39;s consciousness. Wi=\r\nth either practice, of course, the key to success are regularity and persis=\r\ntence.\n \nIf someone has an apartment in a western country without any firep=\r\nlace or balcony and doing homam with dry coconut pieces next to a window in=\r\n a room is also not possible due to strict fire rules, I want to suggest an=\r\n option that enables a mini-homam. Such people can do a &quot;deepa homam&quot; (homa=\r\nm in a lamp). Pour some melted ghee in a small mud/copper/silver/bronze/bra=\r\nss/golden pot (or lamp stand). Put in a wick in it. Treating it as a homa k=\r\nundam, do homam normally. When it is time to install fire, light the wick. =\r\nWith each swaahaa, pour a drop of melted ghee in the pot. Do everything els=\r\ne as in the procedure.\n \nAs I said, homam with a big fire is better, but so=\r\nmething is definitely better than nothing. Do deepa homam with a lamp and t=\r\nhen meditate after poornaahuti. BTW, poornaahuti can be a spoonful of melte=\r\nd ghee.\n \nOne point I forgot to make earlier:\n \nIf someone is buying a new =\r\nhouse and looking for guidance, one more small factor. If homam is done in =\r\nthe northeast or east or southeast corners of the house, it is better. One =\r\ncan look for a house that has a fireplace or balcony in those sides. Of cou=\r\nrse, those who already have a house and doing homam elsewhere need not worr=\r\ny. The key is to do it. Guidelines in shastras are for enhancing the experi=\r\nence a little and not for blocking it out of fear of breaking guidelines.\n =\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n \n---- vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Ad=\r\niti ji \n&gt; \n&gt; As Rajarishi ji and Narasimha ji have already answered most of=\r\n your questions ,just wanted to share some additional thoughts.
