So far I have done my homams without invoking the diety in idol.\n\nI want=\r\n to do chandi homam but after reading list of rules (like one shouldn&#39;t yaw=\r\nn, not hold the book in hand, sitting place should be very clean, no singin=\r\ng of mantras, pronouncing mantras properly etc ) am a bit scared. Also in t=\r\nhe manual you have mentioned women shouldn&#39;t fall to lust while doing chand=\r\ni homam. Can you please put more light into this? What will be the conseque=\r\nnces if a woman fails? \n My parents are advising me not to do any complicat=\r\ned rituals as one can face anything but not the wrath of god. Kindly advice=\r\n.\n\nRegards and thanks,\nShraddha\n\n\n"}}
