Dharm=\r\na depends on the desh-kaal-patra. Swami Ramdas - an amsa of Hanuman - inspi=\r\nred Shivaji Maharaj to fight against the Moghuls. Had it not been so, today=\r\n Kashi would have remained Muhammadabad and Mathura and Prayag would have b=\r\necome Mecca and Medina.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;However at the same ti=\r\nme I am sure there were probably other self-realized saints in India who ne=\r\nver bothered themselves with the political situation of the land. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;So everyone to his/her path. If you feel a strong urge=\r\n for something, probably your swa-dharma crosses through those points.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;stro=\r\nng&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdan=\r\na;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&quot;Between me=\r\n and You, there is only me.\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0=\r\n00000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Take away the me, so only You re=\r\nmain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;str=\r\nong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Thu, 1/4/10, krishna Kanth &lt;i&gt;&lt;krite=\r\nls@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px =\r\nsolid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@yahoo. com&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Ramana Maharshi says Each person had an all=\r\notted role to play in this world&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;D=\r\nate: Thursday, 1 April, 2010, 5:11 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv591561144&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpaddi=\r\nng=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hi.&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why is he interfering in all these ins=\r\ntead of keeping quiet?=E2=80=99&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Many a times even i think why all these spiritual men like Kan=\r\nchi Kamakoti Peetadhipathi has to talk about the ongoing Political crisis a=\r\nnd land into controversies.
