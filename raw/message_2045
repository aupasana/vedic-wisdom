Rao&quot; &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot point to any audio that I found sa=\r\ntisfactory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please buy the book &quot;Mantrapushpam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. I=\r\nt gives Gayatri \n&gt; mantra with intonation marked correctly. It has many oth=\r\ner veda mantras too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will point out a few standard mistakes I have s=\r\neen people make:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas =\r\n(letters with lines \n&gt; below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few ud=\r\nattas come in a row. For \n&gt; example, all the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; ar=\r\ne without any lines below or \n&gt; above. They have to be pronounced in the sa=\r\nme pitch. People end up \n&gt; introducing some pitch variation and mispronounc=\r\ning them. In veda mantras, \n&gt; pronouncing all udattas in the same pitch is =\r\nthe most important thing. Do \n&gt; not stress any letter or take the pitch up/=\r\ndown when pronouncing a string of \n&gt; udattas.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) The last syllable of=\r\n &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to be one \n&gt; syllable. When you p=\r\nronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If you \n&gt; artificially add an=\r\n vowel at the end of it and make it &quot;prachodayaatu&quot;, you \n&gt; will end up int=\r\nroducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess up everything. A \n&gt; lot of peopl=\r\ne do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probably some guru sometime \n&gt; back start=\r\ned the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words ending \n&gt; in a =\r\nconsonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what consonant he \n&gt; wa=\r\ns saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This is good for \n&gt;=\r\n teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it wit=\r\nh \n&gt; a consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and =\r\ndo NOT \n&gt; add a brief vowel after that consonant.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo n=\r\naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in Sanskrit \n&gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notat=\r\ned in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You are \n&gt; supposed to le=\r\nt air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation \n&gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is=\r\n very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this is \n&gt; supposed =\r\nto be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, make \n&gt; it &quot;=\r\nnaha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added to \n&gt; =\r\nthe mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this=\r\n style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is pronounced \n&gt; diff=\r\nerently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is p=\r\nronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, respectively \n&gt; (i.e. raam=\r\naha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as \n&gt; letting air =\r\ngo, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 \n&gt; words.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\natch out for these 3 common mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, as I keep saying, the p=\r\nronunciation is only a small percentage of \n&gt; it. Creating the right mental=\r\n images and the perfect mental focus is more \n&gt; important. If you lose awar=\r\neness of your body, successfully shut down all \n&gt; other thoughts in the min=\r\nd and achieve a perfect mental focus on any veda \n&gt; mantra with correct pro=\r\nnunciation, it will be a fantastic experience. Please \n&gt; note that correct =\r\npronunciation is not difficult to achieve, but the other \n&gt; things I mentio=\r\nned here are not that easy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Proper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and Intonation - \n&gt; Aud=\r\nio Source\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you point me towards any =\r\neasily obtainable audio recording of the \n&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem=\r\n to be correctly executed?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, would you mind typing it out here,=\r\n phonetically?
