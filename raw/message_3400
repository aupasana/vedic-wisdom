Why did God put us here?&quot; Thes=\r\ne\nquestions keep\ncoming up, again and again. Perhaps, you want to find God =\r\nand hang him!\nFundamentally, what you are asking is: why creation?\nWhen it =\r\ncomes to creation, you never ask why, because you are just a\ntiny speck in\n=\r\nthis creation. As a human being, in terms of family, your social\nstructures=\r\n, your\nfinancial securities, education, qualifications and positions that y=\r\nou\nhave taken in\nthe society, I know you slowly started assuming that you a=\r\nre the center\nof the\nuniverse=97but you are just a tiny speck in the existe=\r\nnce! Tomorrow,\nif you\ndisappear, nobody will miss you.\nSo, this tiny speck =\r\nasking the question, `Why creation,&#39; does\nnot make sense\nbecause the questi=\r\non doesn&#39;t come from the right context. This\nquestion comes up\nbecause the =\r\nexperience of life has not become blissful. The struggles,\nthe pain of\nexis=\r\nting, are there.\nYou might have created so many comforts, so much security,=\r\n but still the\ninherent\nstruggle and pain, the day-to-day tensions are ther=\r\ne. You have to drag\nyour feet\nand do many things, isn&#39;t it? You fill yourse=\r\nlf with enthusiasm; you\nfind new reasons\nfor yourself to do this and that. =\r\nBut somewhere inside there is\nsomething which\nconstantly struggles in every=\r\n human being, unless he attains to certain\ninner grace.\nSome people have be=\r\ncome aware of it; most people are yet to even become\naware\nof it. They just=\r\n keep themselves busy, never to face the inner struggle.\nThe reason why peo=\r\nple are keeping themselves so busy, keeping themselves\nso\nentangled with li=\r\nfe is not because they have fallen in love with life.\nIt is just to avoid\nt=\r\nhe inner struggle. Many of them, if they don&#39;t get married, if they\ndon&#39;t p=\r\nroduce\nchildren, if they don&#39;t start businesses and don&#39;t get into all\nthe =\r\nmess that they are\ngetting into on a day-to-day basis, they would be lost w=\r\nithin\nthemselves.\nJust to keep a certain semblance of sanity, they keep all=\r\n this activity\ngoing. If they\njust sit quietly for two days in one place, t=\r\nhey will become aware of\nthe inner\nstruggle that is there in every being tr=\r\napped in this limited body. Once\nthey become\naware, they start looking. Tha=\r\nt is when we say somebody is on the\nspiritual path,\nbecause he has become a=\r\nware of the inner struggle.\nThe Yoga Sutras are a tremendous document about=\r\n life, but they start in\na strange\nway. The first sutra is half a sentence.=\r\n Patanjali starts the yoga sutra\nlike this: And\nnow: yoga. This simply mean=\r\ns that you have seen everything in your\nlife=97either by\nyourself, or throu=\r\ngh somebody else&#39;s life. You saw money, you saw\npower, you saw\npleasure, yo=\r\nu saw wealth=97everything. But still there is an inner\nstruggle. Once you\nh=\r\nave seen this? And now: yoga.\nIf you have not seen it, if you still believe=\r\n that, &quot;if I get a few\nmore bucks everything\nwill be okay; if I build a new=\r\n house everything will be okay&quot;=97if\nyou are still in that\nchildish state t=\r\nhen it&#39;s not time for yoga yet.\nSo the question comes up because there is a=\r\nn inner struggle. Maybe you\nare not\nhundred percent aware of the struggle, =\r\nbut here and there it touches\nyou. So now,\nthe more intelligent question fo=\r\nr you would be: How do I get beyond this\nstruggling\nstate? If you ask how, =\r\nI have a way. If you ask why, then I have to tell\nyou a story.\nIf you want,=\r\n I can tell you a story: one day, God had nothing to do and\nhe was\nplaying =\r\nmarbles. And one marble fell this way and it became planet\nEarth. Another\no=\r\nne shot up and it became the Sun?. I can go on like this. Now you\nwon&#39;t bel=\r\nieve\nthis ridiculous story. But if I make the story more elaborate, and if\n=\r\nthe story were\ntold a thousand years ago, you would believe it. You have a =\r\nproblem\nabout this,\nisn&#39;t it? You don&#39;t believe anything that happens today=\r\n, but you\nwill believe it after a\nthousand years. It doesn&#39;t matter what it=\r\n is.\nBut whether you believe it or not, stories don&#39;t liberate you. So\nwhen=\r\n it comes to\nexistence, don&#39;t waste your life asking the question, `why?&#39;\nB=\r\necause if you sit here\nfor the rest of your life and go on thinking `why,&#39; =\r\nor consult\nevery other man on this\nplanet, all you will get is more and mor=\r\ne fairy tales. You will not get\na solution.\nDifferent cultures will tell di=\r\nfferent stories; different religions will\ntell different stories;\nevery ind=\r\nividual can create his own story. Stories will not liberate\nyou. But if you=\r\n ask\n`how,&#39; then we open up the path, we give you the method.\nDon&#39;t ask why=\r\n.\n\n-Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Ja=\r\nlasutram\n&lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Question: What is the purpose of cr=\r\neation?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramana Maharshi: It is to give rise to this question.
