I do not have the time to d=\r\no any kind of elaborate homam at home due to work commitments, and because =\r\nI already spend a total 1 hour a day on japa (I do not want to reduce the j=\r\napa). I would like to do a really simple homam procedure that takes no more=\r\n than 10-15 minutes- I would do this after half an hour of my japa practice=\r\n.  \n\nIn the Vedic wisdom article online, Narasimhaji says that even lightin=\r\ng a clay pot with some sticks and uttering mantras for a few minutes with g=\r\nenuine devotion will produce results. \nWith this in mind, I have adapted Na=\r\nrasimhaji&#39;s homam article to create a 10 minute Lakshmi Narayana homam proc=\r\nedure for myself and wanted to check if this is okay.\n\nLight havan fire and=\r\n then,\n\n1. Worship Ganesha and pray for removal of any obstacles and forgiv=\r\neness for any mistakes committed during this homam\n\n2. Worship Agni, and re=\r\nquest him to taking my offerings to Lakshmi and Narayana in a pure form \n\n3=\r\n. Worship the Divine Mother in the form of Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati and=\r\n ask for guidance in performing this homam, and for forgiveness for any mis=\r\ntakes. \n\n4. Worship my Guru Swami Sivananda Saraswati of Rishikesh and ask =\r\nfor guidance in performing this homam.\n\n5. Repeat mantras Om Shri MahaLaksh=\r\nmyai Namaha. Svaha. and Om Namo Narayanaya. Swaha. as many times as I can i=\r\nn the ten minutes with devotion, and offering ghee while saying Swaha. Grea=\r\nter proportion of homam time is spent on this.\n\n6. Thank Ganesh and Agni. T=\r\nhank Lakshmi and Narayana. Offer prayer that this homam may be for the welf=\r\nare of all beings. \n\nI know this is a much abbrieviated homam version but i=\r\nt would be the best I can do at present. \n\nDoes this sound alright? Please =\r\ncould Narasimhaji comment.\n\nThanks. \n\nAparna\n\n\n"}}
