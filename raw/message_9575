I wa=\r\nsn&#39;t sure so I stopped doing it. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Do you also stop doing daily/weekl=\r\ny homam during these 4 months?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What is your recommendation?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;T=\r\nhanks so much for guiding us.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Regards\n&gt; &gt;Manisha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
