Propitiation of Mars i=\r\ns useful to a lot of\npeople these days.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Compared to meditating with t=\r\nhe mantra of any deity or worshipping\nan idol or a kalasha, it is more powe=\r\nrful to offer the mantra in fire.\nI was instructed by my spiritual master, =\r\nwho was told by the divine\nMother, to teach simple procedures for worshippi=\r\nng various deities in\nfire and spread the ritual of homam in the world. As =\r\nthe world goes\nthrough an interesting phase in the coming years, it will be=\r\n good to\nhave a large number of people performing homam to various deities =\r\non a\nregular basis around the world.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Several manuals for doing homam =\r\n(fire ritual) to various deities in\n30-40 minutes are already there on my w=\r\nebsite. More manuals will be\nadded in the course of time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now, I have=\r\n added a manual for a short Kuja homam for Mars that can\nperformed everyday=\r\n or once every week (Tuesday or some other day) or\nonce every month. It is =\r\nhoped that some people will take advantage of\nthis manual, get some relief =\r\nfrom the material troubles given by Mars\nthat block their spiritual progres=\r\ns, make some spiritual progress and\nalso contribute to the well-being of th=\r\ne world in a small way.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.com=\r\ncast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
