For example\nWe were told in old days, do no eat food=\r\n which is outside after eclipse. Well at that time science was of the opini=\r\non that there is absolutely nothing wrong. Whereas now science says there i=\r\ns extreme high radiation during eclipse so not only eat open food but shoul=\r\nd not go out side also which was told before.\nI have many such example whic=\r\nh proves that we have given up the palace of gold where we use to live(dhar=\r\nma) and running behind some mirage. Dharm is detailed science. Unfortunatel=\r\ny, it does not get any scientist to research on any of it&#39;s topic. We can p=\r\nroudely work in NASA but we can not take one small dharma book and sit to r=\r\nesearch on it. Hence we have to face what we are facing...\nI was reading Ab=\r\nout the blackhole and few days later I was reading bhagavad puran. And surp=\r\nrisingly it explain the position of blackhole as it is explain by modern sc=\r\nience. Well science still does not explain the characteristic as it is expl=\r\nain in bhagavad. Well it is the time of kaliyuga so it is bound to happen!!=\r\n! \n\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Dec 2, 2010, at 1:59 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is why one scientific=\r\n research may conclude that so and so\n&gt; &gt; medicine helps depression and ano=\r\nther research may later conclude\n&gt; &gt; that the same medicine may make depres=\r\nsed people commit suicide\n&gt; &gt; and the medicine may be recalled!\n&gt; \n&gt; I want=\r\n to expand on this point and go into a different topic. In the last few yea=\r\nrs, we&#39;ve had many cases of anti-depression medicines causing suicides and =\r\nbeing recalled after a few years of field use.\n&gt; \n&gt; In ayurveda, there are =\r\nthree predominant types of people - kapha, pitta and vaata. Various health =\r\nproblems manifest differently in these three types and are treated differen=\r\ntly. For example, take depression. A depressed kapha person (predominant el=\r\nements - earth and water) has dullness and lethargy lurking under the depre=\r\nssion. A depressed pitta person (predominant elements - fire and water) has=\r\n anger and frustration lurking under the depression. A depressed vaata pers=\r\non (predominant elements - air and ether) has anxiety and nervousness lurki=\r\nng under the depression. They are not the same!\n&gt; \n&gt; If a clinical study is=\r\n conducted with mostly vaata people or kapha people, an anti-depressant tha=\r\nt aggravates pitta may seem to work. But, when it is used later by pitta pe=\r\nople who already have accumulated anger and frustration under the depressio=\r\nn, it may aggravate pitta, increase the aggressive streak and make them sui=\r\ncidal. Sadly, modern medicine does not recognize ayurvedic types and does n=\r\not take them into account when performing controlled experiments, drawing c=\r\nonclusions or dispensing medicines in the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Science defines narro=\r\nw (and solvable!) problems and solves them. Once a solvable problem is set =\r\nnarrowly, science shows a perfect path from the problem to the solution. Ho=\r\nwever, the issue is that real life problems are not like that. So those who=\r\n apply science have to approximate the problems using a lot of unspoken ass=\r\numptions, in order to make them solvable and narrow. In the end, the soluti=\r\non may or may not be correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my firm conviction that teachings =\r\nof rishis and Indian yogis (e.g. ayurveda) are far more holistic than the p=\r\niecemeal offerings of modern science, in the areas of physical, mental and =\r\nspiritual wellness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish =\r\nLessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ---- Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nis is a forum for spirituality and not for modern science. Scientific point=\r\ns may be mentioned on the sidelines, but cannot be beaten to death.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any case, please remember that science addresses well-def=\r\nined problems that have a very narrow focus. Unfortunately, complex problem=\r\ns of life can often not be defined in such a narrow manner. As a result, wh=\r\nat happens is that scientists honestly and accurately state their narrow co=\r\nnclusions and those who apply that knowledge end up extrapolating a bit. Th=\r\nat is why one scientific research may conclude that so and so medicine help=\r\ns depression and another research may later conclude that the same medicine=\r\n may make depressed people commit suicide and the medicine may be recalled!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Absorption of proteins, as indicated by BV that was discussed here=\r\n, for example, is just one factor. Absorption of various nutrients, their i=\r\nnterplay, their distribution in the system, their impact on metabolism, ana=\r\nbolism and catabolism etc, are not fully understood by modern science. Mode=\r\nrn science could only capture a data point here and a data point there, but=\r\n not the full holistic picture.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a wrong the=\r\nory as far as human nutrition is concerned, because human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stomach str=\r\nucture (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n far easier to digest than most planet based products.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The issue is=\r\n not the ease of digestion. I did not say &quot;foods that are tougher to digest=\r\n&quot;, but instead used the expression &quot;foods that light up a higher digestive =\r\nagni&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For example, cooked carrots with black pepper powder and gre=\r\nen chillies light up higher agni than cooked carrots with just some coriand=\r\ner powder (and no other heavier spice) and are easier to digest. The latter=\r\n is consider more saattwik, because it lights up less agni for its digestio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some other food like softly cooked onions, for example, may be v=\r\nery easy to digest and light up very little agni in stomach, but when nutri=\r\nents in it are ditributed in the body, they light up a strong agni elsewher=\r\ne in the body. Agni (fire) is transformative energy and so many transformat=\r\nions of matter are occurring everywhere in the body. For example, productio=\r\nn of various enzymes and hormones in the body involves different kinds of a=\r\ngni. Ayurveda enumerates tens of different kinds of agni at the physical le=\r\nvel alone. There are all kinds of connections between these agnis and the f=\r\nood we eat.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When it comes to food that is just sufficient for survi=\r\nval, conserves internal agni and facilitates faster spiritual development, =\r\nayurveda and Indian yogic tradition offer far more holistic theories than m=\r\nodern science can. As I said, modern science captures a data point here and=\r\n a data point there and not a holistic picture. Of course, people like you =\r\nmay want to study modern science critically in order to prepare themselves =\r\nfor possible debates of future. But it is not a good idea to let it control=\r\n your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; .. vegan websites etc .. they merely cherrry pick from researches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhat is politics and not science!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Science provides data points and p=\r\neople construct a big picture based on those data points based on their age=\r\nnda. This applies to all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, in several areas of study, unfor=\r\ntunately science itself is today governed by various political and capitali=\r\nstic agendas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the NPR interview I mentioned=\r\n, I only heard the interview with the researcher on radio. I did not read a=\r\nbout it and hence do not know about their publications. The research took g=\r\norillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were comparable in various ways and d=\r\nid a controlled experiment over a period of time. The explanation in terms =\r\nof brain development was only a speculation. The only real scientific concl=\r\nusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a period of time made =\r\nthem smarter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and hum=\r\nan body structures have concluded that meat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating along with croppin=\r\ng and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4\n&gt; &gt; &gt; million years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited respect for other sp=\r\neculative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take a few points and ex=\r\ntrapolate them to create a picture. That is why they are always evolving an=\r\nd changing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Modern scientific understanding of how human life evolv=\r\ned may or may not be perfect. I am not convinced by any of their conclusion=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I say that there were great civilizations 7 million years ago=\r\n, great kings who ruled earth and people lived orderly lives of happiness a=\r\nnd bliss, modern science will disagree. Mainly because they do not have evi=\r\ndence. But I see no evidence to the contrary either.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This cannot =\r\nbe done consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is =\r\nyour take on this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric =\r\n(divine and demonic) forces that are constantly pulling the universe in dif=\r\nferent directions. Nature favors demonic forces at times and divine forces =\r\nat times, but divine forces in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for t=\r\nhousands of years in the past. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no ris=\r\nhi or god who came to earth said, &quot;this is the work of natural forces and s=\r\no it must be good&quot;. Instead, they fought it and changed things. The predomi=\r\nnant thinking of this age that vegetarianism is &quot;unnatural&quot; and inefficient=\r\n, to me, indicates a temporary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be=\r\n defeated by hook or crook.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...=\r\n.in&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree with two points =\r\nyou mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the science pa=\r\nrt of these discussions, as I had already maintained right at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beg=\r\ninning).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Nati=\r\nonal Public Radio) several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment =\r\non gorillas. One set of gorillas was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was=\r\n fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers found a=\r\n gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat were=\r\n duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have any references for this, in terms of wheth=\r\ner they published any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper on the same, I am interested to know and =\r\nanalyse that in details. I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; open to learning and reviewing my posit=\r\nion, provided there is genuine evidence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that =\r\ndigestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fr=\r\nuits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThough they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual d=\r\nevelopment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is=\r\n concerned, because human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such =\r\nthat it finds certain animal products\n&gt; &gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most =\r\nplanet based products. In my other mail, I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple o=\r\nf research papers and books on clinical nutrition and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dietetics, and =\r\nif you ask, I can provide more; which may take a few days since I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hav=\r\ne to get them from people who deal with these topics professionally, but ti=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not a problem. All the papers are from the most accepted and re=\r\nputed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I said=\r\n, it is myth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that vegeterian foods are easier to digest, if digestibi=\r\nlity is the criteria.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in my experience, I never found =\r\ntraditional vegeterians to be any more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dull or smarter than tradition=\r\nal omnivores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have thei=\r\nr own vaasanas and their needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetaria=\r\nn food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical structure and needs to mainta=\r\nin the same. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I=\r\n have seen people feeding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically spe=\r\naking, an animal whose whole body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; structure is designed to be a carni=\r\nvore, may adjust to any food for the sake of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; survival, but will becom=\r\ne internally weak and susceptable to disease and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who take=\r\ns the karma for the disease and weakness that may result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an unna=\r\ntural diet to an animal?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg d=\r\niet end up being diseased, but the chances\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like=\r\n not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; susceptible to =\r\ncancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion i=\r\ns that an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n way possible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right=\r\n diet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded =\r\nthat meat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant si=\r\nnce at least 4\n&gt; &gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivoro=\r\nus, the structure of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed caecum), =\r\nand the threefold increase in brain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidence=\r\ns) could never have been what it is today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous=\r\n diet has been a natural process, so ingrained that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has changed th=\r\ne very structure of the human body. This cannot be done\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consciously, =\r\nbut only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nrovide relevent research papers to prove my claim).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is you=\r\nr take on this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ___________=\r\n_____________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:0=\r\n3 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There has been a lot of discussion on food. A few quick commen=\r\nts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in ou=\r\nr body and their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, w=\r\nhat we eat has a profound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impact on us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much has been=\r\n written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not=\r\n all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eating th=\r\ne flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nphysical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their phy=\r\nsical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-bas=\r\ned foods is much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cru=\r\nel methods are used for meat production by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; corporations and animals a=\r\nre treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering goes t=\r\no the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview=\r\n with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back.=\r\n They conducted an experiment on gorillas.

Gorillas fed with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and frui=\r\nts may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nough they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual dev=\r\nelopment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sl=\r\neepy and cannot focus well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill.=\r\n That is because the digestive process\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (a=\r\nlso known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agni available for ot=\r\nher activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens i=\r\nn the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nrequires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam =\r\nafter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sa=\r\ndhana before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher =\r\ndigestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy food=\r\ns that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequently, ag=\r\nni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; av=\r\nailable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. =\r\nIf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains,=\r\n simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild sp=\r\nices, and fruits),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more a=\r\ngni is available for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas an=\r\nd experiences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. =\r\nBut huge stacks of dry grass may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarl=\r\ny, little bit of internal fire may be enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual =\r\nideas and experiences in a person with excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obs=\r\ntructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a pers=\r\non with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One p=\r\nerson may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat=\r\n saattwik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformat=\r\nion and yet struggle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best cours=\r\ne of action for one is to ignore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian=\r\n. All other things being equal, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for=\r\n spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals ha=\r\nve their own vaasanas and their needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on ve=\r\ngetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she =\r\nneeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi s=\r\nhould consume enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma in the material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spirit=\r\nual progress. Eating too much food is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific=\r\n days, it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices a=\r\nre more important for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and success, than occasional pra=\r\nctices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all acti=\r\nons or considering food\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the kar=\r\nma involved. It depends on how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and h=\r\now deeply one feels so. If one internally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acti=\r\nng through one and whatever one is doing (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s =\r\nprasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail-1--522552996\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=utf-8\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above that when science will matur=\r\ne enough you will see that it is of the same opinion as Vedas. For example&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were told in old days, do no eat food which is outside after e=\r\nclipse. Well at that time science was of the opinion that there is absolute=\r\nly nothing wrong. Whereas now science says there is extreme high radiation =\r\nduring eclipse so not only eat open food but should not go out side also wh=\r\nich was told before.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have many such example which proves that w=\r\ne have given up the palace of gold where we use to live(dharma) and running=\r\n behind some mirage. Dharm is detailed science. Unfortunately, it does not =\r\nget any scientist to research on any of it&#39;s topic.

And surprisin=\r\ngly it explain the position of blackhole as it is explain by modern science=\r\n. Well science still does not explain the characteristic as it is explain i=\r\nn bhagavad.

In the last few years, we&#39;ve =\r\nhad many cases of anti-depression medicines causing suicides and being reca=\r\nlled after a few years of field use.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nIn ayurveda, there are three=\r\n predominant types of people - kapha, pitta and vaata. Various health probl=\r\nems manifest differently in these three types and are treated differently. =\r\nFor example, take depression. A depressed kapha person (predominant element=\r\ns - earth and water) has dullness and lethargy lurking under the depression=\r\n. A depressed pitta person (predominant elements - fire and water) has ange=\r\nr and frustration lurking under the depression. A depressed vaata person (p=\r\nredominant elements - air and ether) has anxiety and nervousness lurking un=\r\nder the depression. They are not the same!&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nIf a clinical study is=\r\n conducted with mostly vaata people or kapha people, an anti-depressant tha=\r\nt aggravates pitta may seem to work. But, when it is used later by pitta pe=\r\nople who already have accumulated anger and frustration under the depressio=\r\nn, it may aggravate pitta, increase the aggressive streak and make them sui=\r\ncidal. Sadly, modern medicine does not recognize ayurvedic types and does n=\r\not take them into account when performing controlled experiments, drawing c=\r\nonclusions or dispensing medicines in the field.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nScience defines =\r\nnarrow (and solvable!) problems and solves them. Once a solvable problem is=\r\n set narrowly, science shows a perfect path from the problem to the solutio=\r\nn. However, the issue is that real life problems are not like that. So thos=\r\ne who apply science have to approximate the problems using a lot of unspoke=\r\nn assumptions, in order to make them solvable and narrow. In the end, the s=\r\nolution may or may not be correct.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nIt is my firm conviction that =\r\nteachings of rishis and Indian yogis (e.g. ayurveda) are far more holistic =\r\nthan the piecemeal offerings of modern science, in the areas of physical, m=\r\nental and spiritual wellness.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n---=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n  Free Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                  &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Films that make a diffe=\r\nrence: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFil=\r\nms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n     Spirituality: &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  Jyotish writings: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n-----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n---- Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;pvr@c=\r\nharter.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This is a=\r\n forum for spirituality and not for modern science.

Unfortunately, co=\r\nmplex problems of life can often not be defined in such a narrow manner. As=\r\n a result, what happens is that scientists honestly and accurately state th=\r\neir narrow conclusions and those who apply that knowledge end up extrapolat=\r\ning a bit. That is why one scientific research may conclude that so and so =\r\nmedicine helps depression and another research may later conclude that the =\r\nsame medicine may make depressed people commit suicide and the medicine may=\r\n be recalled!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Absorption of proteins, as indicated by BV =\r\nthat was discussed here, for example, is just one factor. Absorption of var=\r\nious nutrients, their interplay, their distribution in the system, their im=\r\npact on metabolism, anabolism and catabolism etc, are not fully understood =\r\nby modern science. Modern science could only capture a data point here and =\r\na data point there, but not the full holistic picture.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * =\r\n* *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=\r\n is concerned, because human&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morpholog=\r\ny) is such that it finds certain animal products&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; far easier t=\r\no digest than most planet based products.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The issue is no=\r\nt the ease of digestion. I did not say &quot;foods that are tougher to digest&quot;, =\r\nbut instead used the expression &quot;foods that light up a higher digestive agn=\r\ni&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For example, cooked carrots with black pepper powder =\r\nand green chillies light up higher agni than cooked carrots with just some =\r\ncoriander powder (and no other heavier spice) and are easier to digest. The=\r\n latter is consider more saattwik, because it lights up less agni for its d=\r\nigestion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Some other food like softly cooked onions, for =\r\nexample, may be very easy to digest and light up very little agni in stomac=\r\nh, but when nutrients in it are ditributed in the body, they light up a str=\r\nong agni elsewhere in the body. Agni (fire) is transformative energy and so=\r\n many transformations of matter are occurring everywhere in the body. For e=\r\nxample, production of various enzymes and hormones in the body involves dif=\r\nferent kinds of agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens of different kinds of agni a=\r\nt the physical level alone. There are all kinds of connections between thes=\r\ne agnis and the food we eat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When it comes to food that i=\r\ns just sufficient for survival, conserves internal agni and facilitates fas=\r\nter spiritual development, ayurveda and Indian yogic tradition offer far mo=\r\nre holistic theories than modern science can. As I said, modern science cap=\r\ntures a data point here and a data point there and not a holistic picture. =\r\nOf course, people like you may want to study modern science critically in o=\r\nrder to prepare themselves for possible debates of future. But it is not a =\r\ngood idea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is not worthy eno=\r\nugh.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; .. vegan websites etc .=\r\n. they merely cherrry pick from researches&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is politics a=\r\nnd not science!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Science provides data points and people c=\r\nonstruct a big picture based on those data points based on their agenda. Th=\r\nis applies to all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In fact, in several areas of study, un=\r\nfortunately science itself is today governed by various political and capit=\r\nalistic agendas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the NP=\r\nR interview I mentioned, I only heard the interview with the researcher on =\r\nradio. I did not read about it and hence do not know about their publicatio=\r\nns. The research took gorillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were comparabl=\r\ne in various ways and did a controlled experiment over a period of time. Th=\r\ne explanation in terms of brain development was only a speculation. The onl=\r\ny real scientific conclusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over=\r\n a period of time made them smarter.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have concl=\r\nuded that meat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been=\r\n prevelant since at least 4&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; million years.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited respect for other specu=\r\nlative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take a few points and extra=\r\npolate them to create a picture. That is why they are always evolving and c=\r\nhanging.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Modern scientific understanding of how human lif=\r\ne evolved may or may not be perfect. I am not convinced by any of their con=\r\nclusions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If I say that there were great civilizations 7 =\r\nmillion years ago, great kings who ruled earth and people lived orderly liv=\r\nes of happiness and bliss, modern science will disagree. Mainly because the=\r\ny do not have evidence. But I see no evidence to the contrary either.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This cannot be done consciously, but only by the work of =\r\nnatural forces.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is your take on this?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nNatural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces=\r\n that are constantly pulling the universe in different directions. Nature f=\r\navors demonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but divine forces=\r\n in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the pa=\r\nst. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who came to earth=\r\n said, &quot;this is the work of natural forces and so it must be good&quot;. Instead=\r\n, they fought it and changed things. The predominant thinking of this age t=\r\nhat vegetarianism is &quot;unnatural&quot; and inefficient, to me, indicates a tempor=\r\nary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be defeated by hook or crook.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jyot=\r\nish writings: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;&lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;&lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14%40yahoo.co.in&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...=\r\n.in&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasi=\r\nmha,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned.

I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; open to learning and reviewing my =\r\nposition, provided there is genuine evidence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nheir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed w=\r\nith&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the=\r\n development of brain.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same =\r\nthing applies to human beings or not, a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian d=\r\niet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is concerned, be=\r\ncause human&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that i=\r\nt finds certain animal products&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; far easier to digest than mos=\r\nt planet based products. In my other mail, I have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; qoted from =\r\na couple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may take a few days=\r\n since I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have to get them from people who deal with these top=\r\nics professionally, but time&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is not a problem. All the papers=\r\n are from the most accepted and reputed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; scientific journals. =\r\nThere is no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that v=\r\negeterian foods are easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Further, in my experience, I never found tradition=\r\nal vegeterians to be any more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditiona=\r\nl omnivores.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: An=\r\nimals have their own vaasanas and their needs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If an animal c=\r\nan survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; An animal has a =\r\nspecific physical structure and needs to maintain the same. But&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people fe=\r\neding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an an=\r\nimal whose whole body&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore=\r\n, may adjust to any food for the sake of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; survival, but will b=\r\necome internally weak and susceptable to disease and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; weakness=\r\nes. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No=\r\nt that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chan=\r\nces&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer,=\r\n but smoking makes one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases th=\r\ne probability. Therefore my personal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; opinion is that an anima=\r\nl if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; way po=\r\nssible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; _______________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A q=\r\nuestion for you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution =\r\nand human body structures have concluded that meat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; eating alo=\r\nng with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure =\r\nof the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed caecum), and the th=\r\nreefold increase in brain&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences)=\r\n could never have been what it is today.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which means, an omni=\r\nvorous diet has been a natural process, so ingrained that it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhas changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.

A few quick comments.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (=\r\n1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we ea=\r\nt has a profound&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; impact on us.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2=\r\n) Much has been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But th=\r\nat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal t=\r\nhat strongly identifies with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; physical body entails a karm=\r\na. Self-identification of plants with their physical&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; body is =\r\nmuch subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; smaller.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Especially these days, very=\r\n cruel methods are used for meat production by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; corporations a=\r\nnd animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Publ=\r\nic Radio) several&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment o=\r\nn gorillas. One set of gorillas was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other =\r\nset was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; months, rese=\r\narchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Their theory wa=\r\ns that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development o=\r\nf brain.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies =\r\nto human beings or not, a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps ca=\r\nn maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (4) =\r\nAfter we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because t=\r\nhe digestive process&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known =\r\nas agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; agni available for othe=\r\nr activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hap=\r\npens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why medita=\r\ntion or homam after&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are nor=\r\nmally advised to do sadhana before&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; eating.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, d=\r\neep fried food&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate dige=\r\nstive agni etc) are consumed more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; frequently, agni is diverte=\r\nd towards digestion more often and there is less agni&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; availab=\r\nle for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grai=\r\nns, simple&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked w=\r\nith mild spices, and fruits),&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards d=\r\nigestion and more agni is available for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; assimilaring intellec=\r\ntual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (6) E=\r\nven a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of interna=\r\nl fire may be enough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and experi=\r\nences in a person with excellent&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstruction=\r\ns (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in a pers=\r\non with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lo=\r\nt of agni on digesting&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual =\r\nprogress. Another person may eat saattwik&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; food, maximize the =\r\nagni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nto progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to i=\r\ngnore&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things =\r\nbeing equal, that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual =\r\nprogress.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Anima=\r\nls have their own vaasanas and their needs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If an animal can =\r\nsurvive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fe=\r\nllow whatever he/she needs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (8) One should eat =\r\nto live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; foo=\r\nd to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating t=\r\noo much food is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specif=\r\nic days, it is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular p=\r\nractices are more important for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; transformation and success, t=\r\nhan occasional practices.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinkin=\r\ng that god is the doer of all actions or considering food&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to =\r\nbe god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. I=\r\nf one internally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one an=\r\nd whatever one is doing (e.g.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to=\r\n one, then one is free.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group em=\r\nail --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-1--522552996--\r\n\n"}}
