The problem is not with Jyotish as a subject. Th=\r\ne problem is with Jyotishis. Their knowledge is imperfect. Based on such im=\r\nperfect knowledge when people recommend gemstones etc, they may or may not =\r\nwork out.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But if we look at it from another point of view, every=\r\n affliction - mental/phsyical/spiritual -=C2=A0is finally a karmic reaction=\r\n. And when one does sadhana, one is basically trying hard to finsh off his =\r\nstorehouse of karmas. Finally God realization is about finsh off the karmas=\r\n which block progress. Instead of putting faith on imperfect jyotishis, one=\r\n is much better off putting his/her faith on a deity whose sadhana he/she i=\r\ns doing and the deity will guide the person correctly in what needs to be d=\r\none. So in that sense, when one plunges into serious sadhana, the person do=\r\nes not feel like consulting jyotishis or checking out charts. The perspecti=\r\nve about life changes. I once made a collection of charts of people who wer=\r\ne good, genuine sadhakas, with some amount of spiritual progress. Some were=\r\n famous, some not famous. When I showed these charts to different jyotishis=\r\n asking them about what is the most defining characteristics of this indivi=\r\ndual, they came up\n&gt;  with all sorts of weird answers which were anything b=\r\nut true. Once a=C2=A0jyotishi knows that the chart belongs to a genuinely s=\r\npiritual person,=C2=A0he can smoothly back engineer many combinations and p=\r\nrove his point. But if no clue is provided, he mostlty fails, specially whe=\r\nn juding spiritual charts. This could well be because when a sadhaka does s=\r\nadhana, he burns off karmas, thus a completely=C2=A0new frequency of analys=\r\nis is needed. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In my view, the ability to predict the f=\r\nuture has nothing to do with knowledge of Jyotish scriptures/shastras. It c=\r\nomes from a different place. One may have mugged up all the classics and ev=\r\nery statement therein, yet, whether his predictions will come true or not i=\r\ns not gauranteed. It is purely based on the shakti acquired through some so=\r\nrt of sadhana in some lifetime. It is like a bank balance. But these days, =\r\njyotishis are mere jyotishis. They hardly do any serious sadhana. Which mea=\r\nns all they do is cash in on previous karmic balance they had acquired and =\r\nuse it for predictions. The day this balance gets over, in this life or=C2=\r\n=A0the next,=C2=A0all knowledge of scriptures won&#39;t help the=C2=A0jyotishi =\r\none bit in getting an accurate=C2=A0prediction. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A yantra may wo=\r\nrk if sufficient energy is infused into it. To infuse that energy, again yo=\r\nu need someone who has the energy to infuse it. Or one can keep worshipping=\r\n the yantra till it acquires sufficient energy. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; So, considering=\r\n all these, I feel it is far=C2=A0better to keep focusing on ones own sadha=\r\nna with greater intensity, rather than spending time analysing horoscopes t=\r\no find out short-cut remedies. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Just some random thoughts.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 11/6/10, vemparla=\r\nramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: vemparlaramkishore=\r\n &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Efficacy of Remedia=\r\nl Measures\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, 11 June, 2010=\r\n, 1:18 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Biswajit Ji\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though the quest=\r\nion was not addressed to me and am no where having the knowledge level of N=\r\narasimha Ji or other learned members, Let me attempt an answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; K .N R=\r\nao ji has proved very conclusively that the gemstone therapy has no scriptu=\r\nral basis in any of the jyotisha classics.BPHS does not have a mention of t=\r\nhe gem stones at all .

Do=\r\n they work? I will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and insi=\r\nghts. I will be honest, straight-forward and blunt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope tha=\r\nt their problems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of produc=\r\ning any results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting th=\r\nat a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout lif=\r\ne. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Le=\r\nt me first address why this has come to be and then talk about what we shou=\r\nld do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it i=\r\ns today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily int=\r\nerested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primar=\r\nily interested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshat=\r\nriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily in=\r\nterested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with =\r\nthe varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. =\r\nHowever, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s =\r\nown varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into=\r\n a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, f=\r\nor example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be intereste=\r\nd in knowledge and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence=\r\n, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated en=\r\nough spiritual energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capabl=\r\ne of performing very effective poojas for people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Today, peopl=\r\ne who have spiritual potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not=\r\n allowed to develop fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people bo=\r\nrn in Brahmana families may also end up getting into modern careers and not=\r\n developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana familie=\r\ns with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests w=\r\nho are interested in power, authority and control over others, money and ph=\r\nysical pleasures. Those priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual=\r\n progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who h=\r\nave done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy =\r\nare so few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars =\r\nin one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for thousand dollars is meaning=\r\nful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check g=\r\niven by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by =\r\na priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One important note: The power is not in a combination of syllable=\r\ns (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the =\r\nMIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of p=\r\nhysical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tende=\r\nncy to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and ritua=\r\nls as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key =\r\nis focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes wi=\r\nth a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice whe=\r\nn they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and b=\r\nrought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the houses of peop=\r\nle or in temples.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I did see priests who have done good sadhana=\r\n, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are gettin=\r\ng rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding su=\r\nch a priest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Given this, one is better off =\r\nnot depending on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothin=\r\ng against the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Br=\r\nahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by b=\r\nirth&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - deve=\r\nlop into true Brahmanas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is=\r\n possibly proud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly not ide=\r\nntifying with your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast =\r\nyour identification with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem w=\r\nill be better than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after=\r\n practice, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no =\r\nharm in trying.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many people think that pooj=\r\nas to gods are a serious matter and only a trained priest should do them. T=\r\nhe procedures have evolved to become quite complicated over the time too!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Sup=\r\npose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of pr=\r\notein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such b=\r\nalanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or wi=\r\nll you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lenti=\r\nl soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/rit=\r\nual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with wh=\r\nat you know. It will only give you energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion th=\r\nat some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally basele=\r\nss, but it is irrelevant today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mi=\r\nnd on some mantras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someo=\r\nne with a high level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work=\r\n very fast and give specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposel=\r\ny hidden (almost) such things in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give an anal=\r\nogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe=\r\n to use, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs t=\r\no learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself b=\r\ny accident.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely removed =\r\nammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not =\r\nrisky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machin=\r\ne gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;A=\r\nmmunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and ritual=\r\ns (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, one=\r\n can start using them right away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of technicalities rela=\r\nted to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to=\r\n be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicali=\r\nties one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be=\r\n placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually o=\r\nne&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may co=\r\nme.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we =\r\ncannot expect specific results to come in specific counts of recitation. So=\r\n we should just do the best job we can and leave the result to god, who dec=\r\nides when and what result should be given.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that =\r\nno effort is wasted in the end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit o=\r\nr the other, sometime or the other!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Diffe=\r\nrent mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes. They m=\r\natter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you m=\r\nay be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start begging wi=\r\nth some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years looking for th=\r\ne perfect begging bowl.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of waiting for astrologers wit=\r\nh half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or r=\r\nitual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you resp=\r\nect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vis=\r\nhnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheema=\r\nrupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra,=\r\n Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chan=\r\ndipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, V=\r\nyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stot=\r\nra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nDo not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, =\r\nperfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere he=\r\nart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved=\r\n or you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focu=\r\ns will improve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this context, I want to =\r\nsay a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fire ritua=\r\nl is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water a=\r\nnd air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with=\r\n. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living go=\r\nd that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire p=\r\nurifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most o=\r\nther sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality an=\r\nd removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for=\r\n granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the puddin=\r\ng is in eating it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regula=\r\nrly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;=\r\nBrihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for =\r\nguidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various =\r\ntypes of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. =\r\nIn fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to foll=\r\now whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus o=\r\nn the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homa=\r\nm. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people have,=\r\n that homam is not for Kali yuga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Bhagav=\r\nad Gita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa amon=\r\ng all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japam (meditati=\r\non) is superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among al=\r\nl mantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and l=\r\neave all other mantras?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one says that sitting on the pinnac=\r\nle is the best part of climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the proce=\r\nss of climbing it using various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one need=\r\ns that process to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle direct=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the sour=\r\nce of all, but reaching the source may require using several mantras first =\r\nto purify oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (j=\r\napa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and prep=\r\naration by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n When one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and one =\r\nis unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly=\r\n purified person does japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one may rea=\r\nch samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doin=\r\ng various types of homam by oneself are available on the website given belo=\r\nw. You can use the resources on that website to perform several kinds of sh=\r\nort homam by yourself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of people are performing=\r\n homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are also doing mon=\r\nthly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him=\r\n can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) told me that the Divine Mother =\r\nappeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in Mar=\r\nch 2006, directed him to spread a simplified homam ritual around the world,=\r\n and showed him that hundreds of thousands of people would be performing re=\r\ngular homam in a few years, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Tr=\r\nuth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to my rational mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n However, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of people are a=\r\nlready performing regular homam. Though these are just the early days, the =\r\ndevelopments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp=\r\n and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such =\r\npeople are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I=\r\n also know personally that some people doing homam for a couple of years ar=\r\ne actually starting to experience things within and outside and, more impor=\r\ntantly, going through rapid internal transformation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything=\r\n to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I k=\r\nnow, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hand=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those wh=\r\no have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! If one gets=\r\n into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great potential t=\r\no transform one&#39;s life, materially and spiritually..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam web=\r\nsite:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
