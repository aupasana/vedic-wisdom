What I am t=\r\nrying to ask is..should one surrender\n&gt; to any God we come across or loyalt=\r\ny towards one God is important? If\n&gt; loyalty is important then can I read D=\r\nurga Saptashati and say although I\n&gt; am praying to you mother I surrender t=\r\no Lord vishnu only? \n\nDo not think of it in terms of loyalty. Gods are not =\r\nlike egoistic people who compete with others and have qualities like possis=\r\nsiveness, jealosy etc. Gods are different aspects of (and pathways to) the =\r\nSupreme.\n\nAll gods are slightly different emanations of the supreme cosmic =\r\nbeing, who may also be called &quot;the Self of all&quot;. In order to realize Self, =\r\none needs to reach the supreme cosmic being. That can be done through vario=\r\nus gods. First develop attachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualities,=\r\n think of him/her all the time and reach him/her. Then you can reach the su=\r\npreme cosmic being through that god.\n\nOne who is most attached to Vishnu/La=\r\nkshmi/Shiva/Durga/Ganesha/Surya should look at that god as the supreme god =\r\nfrom whom all gods emanate. All other gods are created from that god and re=\r\nst in that god. It is fine to worship various gods, thinking that they are =\r\nall different manifestations of the god one is attached to.\n\nIf one has not=\r\n found a god one is attached to and about whom one can think like this, the=\r\nn one may have to look more.\n\n&gt; During navratri is it ok to read devi mahat=\r\nmyam when a women has her\n&gt; periods? If no then what can she do to acheive =\r\nthe maximum benefit?\n\nIn my personal opinion, it is ok to read mentally. If=\r\n you do external rituals like homam, idol worship etc, however, I suggest n=\r\not doing them during periods and to read mentally instead. This is particul=\r\narly true for homam. While I do not fully understand the rationale through =\r\npersonal experience, I like to respect the words of tradition and of people=\r\n who know more than me.\n\n&gt; My homam fire is small so just wondering if it i=\r\ns ok to put chopped basil\n&gt; leaves,chopped betel leaves or should one put w=\r\nhole leaf only. I always see\n&gt; you use the words whole turmeric, whole lemo=\r\nn etc hence this doubt. \n\nYes. Undivided and full parts are better, but off=\r\nering something compatible with the size of your fire and making sure that =\r\nit burns fully and comfortably is the most important criterion. So feel fre=\r\ne to pur chopped things.\n\n* * *\n\nNamaste Mitesh,\n\n&gt; In the tarpana process =\r\nwe invite all ancestors in the copper vessel\n&gt; but in the end what should w=\r\ne do, request them to go back to their respective places?\n\nThe mantra used =\r\nfor invocation does not ask for ancestors to enter the water in the kalasha=\r\n. It asks them to come to the area to receive the water offering. When they=\r\n are satisfied with the sesame water, they leave. Explicit sendoff is not d=\r\none in the tradition I am familiar with. If one feels uncomfortable and wan=\r\nts to send off formally, one can say &quot;OM pitruun yathaasthaanam sthaapayaam=\r\ni&quot;.\n\n&gt; Also is it ok to tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?\n\nIt is not idea=\r\nl, but it is better to do sometime than not to do at all.\n\n* * *\n\nNamaste A=\r\nshok,\n\n&gt; &quot;At the end of pitru-tarpanam, the following needs to be said in c=\r\nonclusion:\n&gt; &quot;narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Can =\r\nyou clarify the meaning also?\n\nThe verse &quot;narakeshu samasteshu&quot; at the end =\r\nmeans: &quot;Whoever are stuck in various hells (inauspicious realms of existenc=\r\ne in which mind can be stuck after death) and suffering there, I am offerin=\r\ng this water for them, thinking of their relief.&quot;.
