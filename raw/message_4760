I received fantastic compliments from several learned people, both from west and India, for a clear and balanced presentation.\n \nA writeup that tries to capture that presentation is now available for a free download. If you are interested, please go to:\n \nhttp://tinyurl.com/homamwhy (tinyurl dot com slash homamwhy)\n \nIf you want the full link, use the following:\n \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam/homam_why.pdf\n \nIf you find the writeup useful, please feel free to benefit from it and pass the word around. Otherwise, kindly ignore.\n \nBTW, I followed up this presentation with a two hour practical workshop, where I explained the why and how of homam and did a practical demonstration. According to the organizers, that workshop was the most attended event of the entire conference. My goal was to inspire some people to perform a quick 20 min homam by themselves on a regular basis.\n \nBest regards,\nPVR Narasimha Rao\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
