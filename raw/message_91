It is exerted more. More activity in the Ida nadi soothes the person wi=\r\nth cool energy (Moon). This kind of praanaayaam when done for a few months =\r\ncan make the person pick up weight. It can also increase contentment on the=\r\n positive side and laziness on the negative.\n \nIf one does uni-directional =\r\npraanaayaam while breathing in through the right nostril, the Pingala nadi =\r\n(solar channel) becomes activated. It is exerted more. More activity in the=\r\n Pingala nadi excites the person with warm energy (Sun). This kind of praan=\r\naayaam when done for a few months can make the person lose weight. It can a=\r\nlso increase activeness on the positive side and irritability on the negati=\r\nve.\n \nThe difference between starting with right and left is more prominent=\r\n in uni-directional praanaayaam than in anulom-vilom. Similar difference is=\r\n found in anulom-vilom based on left/right, but the degree is smaller.\n \nIf=\r\n you are used to starting with left nostril in anulom-vilom like most are, =\r\ncontinue like that.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n    Namaste Bhupendra ji,\n\n    (0) W=\r\nhen you breathe in, diaphragm (the muscle between lungs and stomach) \n    s=\r\nhould move down so that lungs can expand and move down and push stomach. \n =\r\n   Then stomach protrudes outward. This gives more volume to lungs and they=\r\n can \n    take more air. When you breathe out, stomach is contracted inside=\r\n and \n    diaphragm moves up and lungs contract and move up. This is the co=\r\nrrect \n    breathing.\n\n    Due to the bias in modern lifestyle against a st=\r\nomach that protrudes out, \n    this natural breathing is sub-consciously cu=\r\nrbed by most people. They don&#39;t \n    give enough room to their lungs when t=\r\nhey breathe in. Their stomach does not \n    move.\n\n    Some people do it ev=\r\nen worse. As the lungs are sucking in air, their lung \n    muscles get used=\r\n to sucking everything around them towards them. Thus, their \n    diaphragm=\r\n is sucked in by the lungs and moves UP when they are breathing in. \n    Wh=\r\nen they are breathing out, all the lung muscles are relaxed and move away \n=\r\n    from lungs. This releases the diaphragm to move DOWN when breathing out=\r\n. \n    This bad breathing style actually reduces the volume of lungs consid=\r\nerably \n    (instead of increasing it considerably) when breathing in. This=\r\n is the \n    opposite of the correct breathing. This is quite bad. Unfortun=\r\nately, many \n    people &quot;suffer from&quot; this breathing style these days!\n\n   =\r\n (1) I am aware of 1:4:2. But 1:1:1 is better for overall health. That is \n=\r\n    what Vasishtha and Vivekananda taught. Make pooraka and rechaka the sam=\r\ne and \n    make kumbhaka as whatever is comfortable.\n\n    (3) Well, it is i=\r\nndeed tough to get a good rhythm with mantra in 1:4:2. But \n    mantra work=\r\ns quite well with 1:1. In the beginning, you will be focussing on \n    mant=\r\nra. After some days, it is possible to focus on breath too. Actually, \n    =\r\nI&#39;ll say the purpose is served irrespective of whether you are focussing on=\r\n \n    mantra or breath or even an image of god. As long as there is some fo=\r\ncus for \n    the mind, the purpose is served.\n\n    (4) When you breathe in =\r\nforcefully and hold the air, it does feel very nice. \n    But everythingthi=\r\nng that feels nice is not necessarily good for you!\n\n    (5-6) If you have =\r\na knee problem, do sit on a chair. Irrespective of how \n    your legs are, =\r\nmake sure that you have your back and head erect and eyes \n    closed. That=\r\n is the key. If you fall asleep, then you will have to find some \n    solut=\r\nion that stops you from doing it.\n\n    (7) This is not a problem with praan=\r\naayaama alone. This is a fundamental \n    problem with all sadhana. Each mo=\r\nde of spiritual sadhana (japam, \n    praanaayaamam, homam etc) gives result=\r\ns based on our level of purity and \n    purity comes as you do more sadhana=\r\n. It is a chicken-and-egg came. You just \n    have to get started and hang =\r\nin there without worrying about the speed at \n    which results are coming.=\r\n Slowly the momentum builds. After crossing a \n    threshold, results start=\r\n coming very quickly.\n\n    You just do the best you can do at a given point=\r\n of time and leave the rest \n    to Her.\n\n    If you have time, energy and =\r\ninclination, you can consider homam. Out of all \n    the practices I know, =\r\nhomam is the fastest in burning karmas and purifying \n    one&#39;s core. That =\r\nis the power of living fire. If you do a daily homam of \n    30-45 min for =\r\n6 months, your dhyana and dharana will improve a lot.\n\n    * * *\n\n    A cou=\r\nple of additional points:\n\n    (9) There is something known as the &quot;nasal c=\r\nycle&quot;. The breathing is not \n    equal in the two nostrils at all times. Th=\r\ne left nostril is more free and \n    the right nostril is less free for 2 h=\r\nours. Then the right nostril is more \n    free and the left nostril is less=\r\n free for another 2 hours. And so on. This \n    pattern was taught by Yogis=\r\n and now science also found it and calls it the \n    nasal cycle. The 2 hou=\r\nr period mentioned by me is ideal. In most people, it \n    is different. Fo=\r\nr example, someone may have a more active right nostril for \n    2.5 hours =\r\nand a more active left nostril for 1.5 hours.\n\n    Keep one nostril closed =\r\nand breathe in and breathe out through the other \n    nostril. Now swich th=\r\ne try the other nostril. See which one feels more free. \n    You can also s=\r\ntand in front of a mirror and breathe in out through both \n    nostrils and=\r\n see in the mirron which nostril is opening more.\n\n    If you track your cy=\r\ncle, the time when the active nostril is about to change \n    is a good tim=\r\ne to do praanaayaama. At the transition time, both nostrils are \n    more o=\r\nr less equally open! That is conducive to a more fruitful \n    praanaayaama=\r\n.\n\n    In general, the right and left nostrils are associated with the Ping=\r\nala \n    (Surya) and Ida (Chandra) nadis of the subtle body. In modern scie=\r\nntific \n    terminology, they are associated with the sympathetic and paras=\r\nympathetic \n    nervous systems. One nervous system is &quot;push&quot; based and the=\r\n other is &quot;pull&quot; \n    based. One excites and the other restrains. As a resu=\r\nlt, there is balance.\n\n    There are certain activities that are best perfo=\r\nrmed when the right nostril \n    is more active and certain activities that=\r\n are best performed when the left \n    nostril is more active. It is also p=\r\nossible to force a change in the active \n    nostril through action. If you=\r\n lie down on the floor on your left side, then \n    the right nostril will =\r\nopen up in 5-10 minutes. Or, if you chant Savitru \n    Gayatri mantra for a=\r\n while perfectly, the right nostril will open up.\n\n    (10) Just as there i=\r\ns a kumbhaka between pooraka and rechaka, it is possible \n    to have a sho=\r\nonyaka (name coined by me) between rechaka and pooraka. It is \n    possible=\r\n to empty the lungs (rechaka) and hold like that for a while \n    (shoonyak=\r\na) before breathing in again (pooraka). Though Vasishtha does not \n    ment=\r\nion the name shoonyaka, he does talk in Yoga Vaasishtham about holding \n   =\r\n breath after rechaka and seeing gods and celestials.\n\n    However, this is=\r\n a really dicey thing and I should have perhaps not even \n    mentioned. On=\r\ne needs to be guided by a sadguru and have his blessings.\n\n    (11) When yo=\r\nu do anulom-vilom, do you breath in through right nostril first \n    or lef=\r\nt? Both are possible. If you start breathing from the left, it causes \n    =\r\n&quot;Pushti&quot; (nourishment). If you start breathing from right, it causes \n    &quot;=\r\nYashti&quot; (sacrifice, i.e. burning). The Ida nadi (Moon - left) causes \n    p=\r\nushti, while Pingala nadi (Sun - right) causes yashti. Depending on what \n =\r\n   you want, you can adopt one way.\n\n    Instead of anulom-vilom, it is act=\r\nually possible to always breathe in from \n    left and breathe out through =\r\nright (to gain weight, i.e. pushti) or to \n    breathe in from right and br=\r\neathe out through left (to lose weight, i.e. \n    yashti). In this approach=\r\n, all poorakas are from ONE nostril (left or right) \n    and all rechakas a=\r\nre through the other nostril (right or left). This is good \n    for the spe=\r\ncific purpose of activating one nadi.\n\n    Even in anulom-vilom, different =\r\nteachers teach differently. You decide it \n    based on your goal. I have g=\r\niven the basis above.\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    ----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n    Homam manual and audio: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0130_01C7C316.173BCB80\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16481&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear B=\r\nhupendra ji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If one does uni-directional praanaayaa=\r\nm while \nbreathing in through the left nostril, the Ida nadi (lunar channel=\r\n) becomes \nactivated.

Make pooraka and rechaka the same and &lt;BR&gt;make kumbhaka as=\r\n whatever \n    is comfortable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) Well, it is indeed tough to get a=\r\n good rhythm \n    with mantra in 1:4:2. But &lt;BR&gt;mantra works quite well wit=\r\nh 1:1. In the \n    beginning, you will be focussing on &lt;BR&gt;mantra. After so=\r\nme days, it is \n    possible to focus on breath too. Actually, &lt;BR&gt;I&#39;ll say=\r\n the purpose is \n    served irrespective of whether you are focussing on &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;mantra or breath or \n    even an image of god. As long as there is some f=\r\nocus for &lt;BR&gt;the mind, the \n    purpose is served.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(4) When you brea=\r\nthe in forcefully and hold the \n    air, it does feel very nice. &lt;BR&gt;But ev=\r\nerythingthing that feels nice is not \n    necessarily good for you!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n(5-6) If you have a knee problem, do sit on \n    a chair. Irrespective of h=\r\now &lt;BR&gt;your legs are, make sure that you have your \n    back and head erect=\r\n and eyes &lt;BR&gt;closed. That is the key. If you fall \n    asleep, then you wi=\r\nll have to find some &lt;BR&gt;solution that stops you from \n    doing it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;(7) This is not a problem with praanaayaama alone. This is \n    a fundamen=\r\ntal &lt;BR&gt;problem with all sadhana. Each mode of spiritual sadhana \n    (japa=\r\nm, &lt;BR&gt;praanaayaamam, homam etc) gives results based on our level of \n    p=\r\nurity and &lt;BR&gt;purity comes as you do more sadhana. It is a \n    chicken-and=\r\n-&lt;WBR&gt;egg came. You just &lt;BR&gt;have to get started and hang in \n    there wit=\r\nhout worrying about the speed at &lt;BR&gt;which results are coming. \n    Slowly =\r\nthe momentum builds. After crossing a &lt;BR&gt;threshold, results start \n    com=\r\ning very quickly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You just do the best you can do at a given point \n=\r\n    of time and leave the rest &lt;BR&gt;to Her.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have time, energy =\r\nand \n    inclination, you can consider homam. Out of all &lt;BR&gt;the practices =\r\nI know, \n    homam is the fastest in burning karmas and purifying &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s=\r\n core. That is \n    the power of living fire. If you do a daily homam of &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;30-45 min for 6 \n    months, your dhyana and dharana will improve a lot.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A \n    couple of additional points:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(9) There is=\r\n something known as the \n    &quot;nasal cycle&quot;. The breathing is not &lt;BR&gt;equal =\r\nin the two nostrils at all \n    times. The left nostril is more free and &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;the right nostril is less free \n    for 2 hours. Then the right nostril i=\r\ns more &lt;BR&gt;free and the left nostril is \n    less free for another 2 hours.=\r\n And so on. This &lt;BR&gt;pattern was taught by \n    Yogis and now science also =\r\nfound it and calls it the &lt;BR&gt;nasal cycle. The 2 \n    hour period mentioned=\r\n by me is ideal. In most people, it &lt;BR&gt;is different. \n    For example, som=\r\neone may have a more active right nostril for &lt;BR&gt;2.5 hours \n    and a more=\r\n active left nostril for 1.5 hours.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keep one nostril closed \n    and=\r\n breathe in and breathe out through the other &lt;BR&gt;nostril. Now swich the \n =\r\n   try the other nostril. See which one feels more free. &lt;BR&gt;You can also s=\r\ntand \n    in front of a mirror and breathe in out through both &lt;BR&gt;nostrils=\r\n and see in \n    the mirron which nostril is opening more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you tr=\r\nack your cycle, \n    the time when the active nostril is about to change &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;is a good time to do \n    praanaayaama. At the transition time, both nost=\r\nrils are &lt;BR&gt;more or less \n    equally open! That is conducive to a more fr=\r\nuitful \n    &lt;BR&gt;praanaayaama.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In general, the right and left nostril=\r\ns are \n    associated with the Pingala &lt;BR&gt;(Surya) and Ida (Chandra) nadis =\r\nof the \n    subtle body. In modern scientific &lt;BR&gt;terminology, they are ass=\r\nociated with \n    the sympathetic and parasympathetic &lt;BR&gt;nervous systems. =\r\nOne nervous system \n    is &quot;push&quot; based and the other is &quot;pull&quot; &lt;BR&gt;based. =\r\nOne excites and the other \n    restrains. As a result, there is balance.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are certain \n    activities that are best performed when the rig=\r\nht nostril &lt;BR&gt;is more active \n    and certain activities that are best per=\r\nformed when the left &lt;BR&gt;nostril is \n    more active. It is also possible t=\r\no force a change in the active &lt;BR&gt;nostril \n    through action. If you lie =\r\ndown on the floor on your left side, then &lt;BR&gt;the \n    right nostril will o=\r\npen up in 5-10 minutes. Or, if you chant Savitru \n    &lt;BR&gt;Gayatri mantra fo=\r\nr a while perfectly, the right nostril will open \n    up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(10) Just =\r\nas there is a kumbhaka between pooraka and rechaka, it \n    is possible &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;to have a shoonyaka (name coined by me) between rechaka and \n    pooraka. =\r\nIt is &lt;BR&gt;possible to empty the lungs (rechaka) and hold like that \n    for=\r\n a while &lt;BR&gt;(shoonyaka) before breathing in again (pooraka). Though \n    V=\r\nasishtha does not &lt;BR&gt;mention the name shoonyaka, he does talk in Yoga \n   =\r\n Vaasishtham about holding &lt;BR&gt;breath after rechaka and seeing gods and \n  =\r\n  celestials.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, this is a really dicey thing and I should hav=\r\ne \n    perhaps not even &lt;BR&gt;mentioned. One needs to be guided by a sadguru =\r\nand have \n    his blessings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(11) When you do anulom-vilom, do you b=\r\nreath in \n    through right nostril first &lt;BR&gt;or left? Both are possible. I=\r\nf you start \n    breathing from the left, it causes &lt;BR&gt;&quot;Pushti&quot; (nourishme=\r\nnt)&lt;WBR&gt;. If you \n    start breathing from right, it causes &lt;BR&gt;&quot;Yashti&quot; (s=\r\nacrifice, i.e. \n    burning). The Ida nadi (Moon - left) causes &lt;BR&gt;pushti,=\r\n while Pingala nadi \n    (Sun - right) causes yashti. Depending on what &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;you want, you can adopt \n    one way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of anulom-vilom, it i=\r\ns actually possible to always \n    breathe in from &lt;BR&gt;left and breathe out=\r\n through right (to gain weight, i.e. \n    pushti) or to &lt;BR&gt;breathe in from=\r\n right and breathe out through left (to \n    lose weight, i.e. &lt;BR&gt;yashti).=\r\n In this approach, all poorakas are from ONE \n    nostril (left or right) &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;and all rechakas are through the other nostril \n    (right or left). Thi=\r\ns is good &lt;BR&gt;for the specific purpose of activating one \n    nadi.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nEven in anulom-vilom, different teachers teach differently. You \n    decide=\r\n it &lt;BR&gt;based on your goal. I have given the basis above.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n    =\r\nregards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-----=\r\n----&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;Homam \n    manual and audio: &lt;A \n=\r\n    href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;r=\r\nologer.org/&lt;WBR&gt;homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n    Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \n    href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;WBR&gt;home.comcas=\r\nt.&lt;WBR&gt;net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n    Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sr=\r\ni \n    Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagann=\r\nath.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;WBR&gt;nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;--------=\r\n-&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0130_01C7C316.173BCB80--\r\n\n"}}
