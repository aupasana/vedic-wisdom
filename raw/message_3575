In this homam as I am sure in all homama there are some mudras \nand mantras recited with the mudra as well. I am wondering three things.\n1. Where can I find the mudras used and explenations of them?\n2. Where can I learn the correct chackra to touch and the mudra used and \nbhiij mantra used for each chakra?\n3. What is the significance of the snapping the fingers four times \naround the head?\n\nAny response would be helpful as well as if someone could help me learn \nthese mantra and mudra. If you are available on skype let me know my \nskype name is &quot;h4v0k_d0m&quot; add me and message anytime. I enjoy making new \nfriends. :-)\n\nAum Namashivaya\n\n"}}
