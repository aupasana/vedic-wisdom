The system is designed to keep you subservient and =\r\nperpetuate itself.  Life is way too short to waste it.  Seek for a way out!=\r\n  Sorcery and Tantra is about Freedom, especially freedom from mental shack=\r\nles.  It will give you the edge you need to get ahead in life.  Seek for fr=\r\needom from the Matrix and its archons.  Emancipate yourself even if it is o=\r\nnly mentally!  You are a spark of the Divine and are meant for greater thin=\r\ngs than this!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are couple of FB forum but they mostly di=\r\nsh around sadhanas for solving issues and provide less theory on tantra. on=\r\ne guy post his tantra sadhana journey, all i can say is that on that path f=\r\nanatics only reach such high levels.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and if you want to=\r\n read about bhairavies \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (good interpretation must otherwise ull get l=\r\nost in words)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Diaries of a Bhairavi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.newrealities.com=\r\n/index.php/component/content/category/170-diaries-of-bhairavi?start=3D50\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are enough clues to find her out. she is a dancer in jakar=\r\nta i guess. she teaches some basic classes also and quite accessible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in case you find any good links do share.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; =\r\n&lt;sunrise_1080@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi j=\r\ni,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for the very interesting information about ta=\r\nntra, a subject I know very little about. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds fasci=\r\nnating. Making an idol of Durga from the mud collected from the house of a =\r\nwidow and a prostitute! I interpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga a=\r\nbides in the heart of a prostitute as much as she does in the heart of a sa=\r\nint, and so the soil from both their houses is equally sacred. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad to hear you say that tantra has so many women of high spirit=\r\nual calibre...that&#39;s very inspiring. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about t=\r\nhem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recently read a wonderful book about the women sain=\r\nts of India, called &quot;Daughters of the Goddess&quot;, written by an American devo=\r\ntee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She asked the same question &quot;Where are =\r\nthe women saints of India?&quot;. A Pandit ji replied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t =\r\nstand on public stages and give seminars, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. =\r\nLinda then went on a pilgrimage to India and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anand=\r\ni Ma and other living realised saints in the female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, bu=\r\nt would love to meet some of the yoginis and Bhairavis you mention.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about tantra and would like to learn more about it. I=\r\n like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but I&#39;m open to learning about o=\r\nther paths (tantra probably includes Japa for all I know). And learning mor=\r\ne about Goddess worship would be great. I see Durga as my spiritual guide, =\r\nkeeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with me (because I&#39;m too lazy to =\r\ndo it on my own), and Hari as the goal (actually they&#39;re the same in my hea=\r\nd and are both my goal as my divine parents). The cowherd girls of yore, cl=\r\never girls, knew that the Goddess alone could give them Hari...as we all kn=\r\now, they famously worshipped Katyayani asking for Krishna, and She gave Him=\r\n to them! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please could you reccommend some articles/books=\r\n on tantra. I would love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may=\r\n be even, add something to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (=\r\naside from abusing and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om=\r\n Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra=\r\n that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Nam=\r\no Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only=\r\n once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it&#39;s not a perfe=\r\nct homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I c=\r\nan&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of=\r\n abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, it&#39;s her own fault). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for the message, and here&#39;s to tantra, the path tha=\r\nt treats women as equals! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
