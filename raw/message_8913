Hence they are never meant to be taken literally ever. They are meant to encourage the devotee to pursue a particular path.\n\n  1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Rama name equals 100 names of Vishnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana)\n\n  2. Next we have Brahmanda Purana that says:\n  sahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrttya tu yat phalam;\n  ekavrttya tu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati\n\n  one Krishna Japa = 3 Rama Japa\n\n  3. What more, the same anushashasana parva in which Vishnu Sahasra Nama is present in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this :\n\n  yO mAm nama sahasrena stotumicchati pandava\n  yohamekena shlokena stuta eva na samshaya \n\n  By saying this Krishna is implying that one can get the same punya os saying entire Vishnu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vishnu Sahasra nama.. Now each shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN itself.. \n  Now we have circular reference in the equation that can never be satisfied !! (Much like GNU stands for GNU is not UNIX !!)\n\n  Hence this one name being equivalent to N other names is a wild goose chase. As PVRji said, its all in the state of mind.\n\n  But there is a specific meditation technique that can be specifically applied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned in preface of VSN itself (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah). Here gauNa does not mean minor. It means &quot;being related to guna&quot;. It means each name extolls one (several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can ponder over that quality of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to practice such technique and requires quite a bit of cross reference reading. It is to be slowly developed over time. But it is very effective.\n\n  Regards,\n  Srikanth\n\n  --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Namaste,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; First, on Ranga&#39;s question:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; There is no single &quot;effective&quot; way. Whether one is chanting oneself or \n  &gt; listening to a person/cassette/CD/MP3, is not the primary factor. The \n  &gt; primary factor is how focused one&#39;s mind is on it. The goal of chanting \n  &gt; a stotra or a mantra is to eliminate or atleast limit other thoughts and \n  &gt; focus the mind on it. That can happen with chanting as well as \n  &gt; listening.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; For example, I may be chanting Vishnu sahasra nama stotra and yet my \n  &gt; mind may be wandering everywhere and focusing on all kind of dirty \n  &gt; thoughts. Another person listening to me while doing some chores may be \n  &gt; focusing a good part of their mental attention on the prayer and \n  &gt; contemplating each word and its meaning and contemplating the qualities \n  &gt; of Lord. In that case, that listener will get a lot more benefit from it \n  &gt; than I will!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Each deity has some qualities. Focusing the mind on a deity and his/her \n  &gt; mantra increases those qualities, over time, in one&#39;s own mind and in \n  &gt; one&#39;s surroundings. If a lot of sadhakas with good concentration worship \n  &gt; Chandi in this world, there may be a lot of violent outrage and fierce \n  &gt; fight against adharma in this world. If a lot of sadhakas with good \n  &gt; concentration worship Vishnu, there may be an upsurge of calm, \n  &gt; self-assured and confident sattwa in the fight for establishing dharma. \n  &gt; These energies balance each other. World is probably in a transition \n  &gt; phase right now and worshippers of Chandi are needed. But, soon, we will \n  &gt; need a lot more people worshipping Vishnu.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; By the way, good sadhakas worshipping Ganesha increase the sense of \n  &gt; stability and groundedness in the world.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Second: Anushtup is the metre with 8 syllables per line and 4 lines per \n  &gt; verse. Whole Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is in anushtup metre. \n  &gt; Traditionally, one specific verse is said to be equivalent to reading \n  &gt; all 1000 names:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; shrIrAma rAma rAmeti. rame rAme manorame.\n  &gt; sahasra nAma tattulyaM. rAma nAma vrAnane..\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Actually, this verse means that chanting &quot;shrIrAma rAma rAma&quot; mantra \n  &gt; (known as Amrita mantra) is equivalent to chanting 1000 names.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; However, don&#39;t take it as a shortcut. If one is lazy and unfocused, \n  &gt; chanting this verse even 100 times may do nothing. First, engage in some \n  &gt; regular practices to remove laziness, instill discipline and sincerity, \n  &gt; and get a state of mind where you can focus well on god. THEN the above \n  &gt; 7-letter mantra can be as effective as 1000 names.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Best regards,\n  &gt; Narasimha\n  &gt; --------\n  &gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  &gt; --------\n  &gt; \n\n\n\n  \n\r\n--Boundary_(ID_G8yqXFFtVNPcX4rBqak4vA)\r\nContent-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META conte=\r\nnt=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.5730.1001&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGR=\r\nOUND-COLOR: #fff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear =\r\nAll,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;All these are for the novice.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;When you transcend, there is no difference between \nHim and you !&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dont be like the Bible people who quote from \nverses=\r\n, highlighting the page, without understanding what is \nimplied.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;I am not decrying Nama Japa.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namamanu=\r\n Adbhutha Swargam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namamanu Pu=\r\nnarbaham&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namamanu Maha Siddhi=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namamanu Samasthavum&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;All these techniques are a great preparation for \nLiberat=\r\nion ( Aurobindo ).

Whole Vi=\r\nshnu sahasra naama stotra is in \n  anushtup metre. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Traditionally, =\r\none specific verse is said to be \n  equivalent to reading &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all 1000=\r\n names:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; shrIrAma rAma \n  rAmeti. rame rAme manorame.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; sahasra nAma tattulyaM. rAma nAma \n  vrAnane..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actually=\r\n, this verse means that chanting &quot;shrIrAma \n  rAma rAma&quot; mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (k=\r\nnown as Amrita mantra) is equivalent to chanting \n  1000 names.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; However, don&#39;t take it as a shortcut. If one is \n  lazy and unfocused=\r\n, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; chanting this verse even 100 times may do \n  nothing. First, eng=\r\nage in some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regular practices to remove laziness, \n  instill disci=\r\npline and sincerity, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and get a state of mind where you \n  can focu=\r\ns well on god. THEN the above &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7-letter mantra can be as \n  effecti=\r\nve as 1000 names.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n  --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--Boundary_(ID_G8yqXFFtVNPcX4rBqak4vA)--\r\n\n"}}
