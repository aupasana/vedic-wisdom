Even i started my sadhana with th=\r\ne same question in mind. \n\nFollow rules or not, my take on it is follow you=\r\nr intuition. Then the question arises how to differentiate between intuitio=\r\nn and wishful thinking? (even i am looking for an answer)\n\nWhy not to follo=\r\nw rules?\nOne might not at all begin his/her sadhana thinking of rules. Sadh=\r\nana has to be tailored with the normal life till one finds a rythm and conf=\r\nidence. Then the rules will be automatically followed based on the seriousn=\r\ness of the sadhak.\n\nWhy to follow rules?\nAs pointed out by Rajarshi, the ch=\r\nandipath had so strict rules may be because of the following reason:\n1. Som=\r\ne sadhanas give immediate heightened awareness to the sadhak. It means they=\r\n can smell, taste, hear and see better than normal. The world all of a sudd=\r\nen starts looking beautiful.\n2. They can visualize better the details of ev=\r\nerything and every being and get lucid dreams.\n3. Normal people are natural=\r\nly attracted to the sadhak because of his/her composure and grace and there=\r\n is a beauty in the way they walk and talk that attracts\n\nThe downfall:\nDes=\r\npite these changes, one thing would still remain...the &quot;Vasanas&quot; which is a=\r\n biggest obstacle to any sadhak. The normal world has many trigger points f=\r\nor vasanas which would entice the sadhak and make him lose control over his=\r\n self. For a male sadhak women would look extraordinarily beautiful and sta=\r\nrt dreaming about them. Their voice, their actions, their laughter would ha=\r\nunt them day n night. Because people are attracted towards sadhak, it boost=\r\ns his ego and he/she forgets the very basic dharmas of life. All this is no=\r\nt the purpose of sadhana and hence the siddhas of past recommended secluede=\r\nd life which protects sadhaka from triggering the vasanas before he attains=\r\n maturity.\nThe first 2 sadhanas (mentioned below)though very simple, gave m=\r\ne the experience explained above (including the downfall).\nSelf-awareness a=\r\nt every waking moment (sometimes sleeping moment also) becomes very essenti=\r\nal to prevent downfall. I cannot put in words the importance of swadhyava (=\r\nself-study)and Ishvara pranidhana (surrender to divine)in this sense. Maybe=\r\n mantra jap all day long is a good idea (as also suggested in Vignyan Bhair=\r\nava Tantra)\n\nSadhana Krama i followed:\n1. jog for a kilometer and do Sudars=\r\nhana Kriya\n2. jog for a kilometer or more and chant long OM and contemplate=\r\n on the after-silence\n3. Jap of moolamantras of navagrahas\n4. Bandhas as gi=\r\nven in Shiva Samhita\n5. Sooryanamaskar and Gayathri Sahasranam Jap (current=\r\n)\n\nThe saying: An old patient is better than the new doctor. I have only pr=\r\nesented my view (with some experience)even though i am only a beginner in t=\r\nhis path so your guidance will be helpful.\n\nOm tat sat\n\n\n\n\n"}}
