This is a loaded question, \nbut I will share a few random t=\r\nhoughts on this and several related \ntopics. More than how to recognize spi=\r\nritual progress, I will be writing \non how NOT to try to recognize it!\n\nIf =\r\nyou don&#39;t like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow \nyour g=\r\nurus and others whom you may prefer.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMATERIAL RESULTS=\r\n\n\nOne obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, like \nmarria=\r\nge, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases \nfaith in =\r\nthe initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.\n\nHowever, that may not h=\r\nappen to everyone. Moreover, such material \nresults do not necessarily show=\r\n spiritual progress. So, how do we \nidentify spiritual progress?\n\n*        =\r\n*        *\n\nGOAL OF SADHANA\n\nSpiritual progress is an internal thing. It is=\r\n well characterized in \nscriptures. Though different scriptures may use dif=\r\nferent words, it all \nboils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, =\r\ndislikes, \nattachments and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of =\r\nthe \nmind. How free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist a=\r\nnd \novercome this innate conditioning.\n\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama=\r\n in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that \nSelf-realization means overcoming conditioning=\r\n. Patanjali defined Yoga \n(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; as &quot;yogaH =\r\nchitta vRtti nirodhaH&quot; \n(Communion is resisting the working of conditioning=\r\n).\n\nThis conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, =\r\n\nwe can deflate the ego completely and then identify with the entire \nunive=\r\nrse, instead of a single entity with a single agenda.\n\n*        *        *\n=\r\n\nIDENTIFYING CONDITIONING\n\nInnate conditioning of the mind, as said before,=\r\n is what determines our \nlikes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend =\r\nto like (or dislike) \nsome people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or av=\r\noid) some things \nthough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (o=\r\nr to do) those \nthings. All this comes from conditioning, which has been ac=\r\ncumulated \nover many lives.\n\nWhen someone praises us, we may know that it i=\r\ns irrelevant (our inner \nvoice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. Whe=\r\nn someone puts us \ndown, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice=\r\n tells us so) \nand yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something a=\r\nbout it. All \nthis comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over=\r\n many \nlives.\n\nIdnetifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, t=\r\nhoughts, \ncalculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. =\r\nThe key \nis to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever t=\r\nhe \ninner voice of conscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled \n=\r\nfrom inside to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of \ncond=\r\nitioning. We often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey \nthe inn=\r\ner voice of our conditioning.\n\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller a=\r\nctions - physical or mental \n- that go against the inner voice of conscienc=\r\ne, it means our \nconditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaning=\r\nful measure of \nspiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for ot=\r\nhers to \njudge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.\n\nThe tricky thing =\r\nis that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also \ncontrolled by our cond=\r\nitioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against \nmy inner voice. Suppose =\r\nI want to analyze what just happened and whether \nI violated my inner voice=\r\n of conscience. That whole process is governed \nby the conditioning too. De=\r\npending on how deeply I am conditioned to \nthink that I am a good person do=\r\ning the right thing and not making a \nmistake, my mind will be impelled to =\r\nlabel the inner voice of conscience \nas a voice of confusion and not accord=\r\n it any importance. Instead, it \nwill focus on the inner voice of condition=\r\ning (which shouts out from \ninside the reasons that justify the action!) an=\r\nd conclude that I did the \nright thing.\n\nThe grip of conditioning is too ti=\r\nght to overcome in a day or two! But, \nthe inner voice of conscience does t=\r\nell everyone when one is doing \nsomething wrong under the influence of cond=\r\nitioning. If one keeps \ntrying, it can oneday help one identify and overcom=\r\ne conditioning.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCES\n\nSometimes, as on=\r\ne makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal or \nmystical or out-o=\r\nf-body experiences, visions and dreams.\n\nFor example, one person I know sta=\r\nrted to feel very light in the head \nwith a vision of bright light of a par=\r\nticular color, when he meditated \nwith a specific mantra. Another person fe=\r\nlt like there was a big fire at \nthe base of his spine and the entire lower=\r\n back was on fire (he actually \nfelt unbearably hot), when he meditated wit=\r\nh a specific mantra. Another \nperson saw a deity appear in front of him and=\r\n the deity talked to him. \nInterestingly, the same deity was seen by anothe=\r\nr person who was also \nsitting there at the same time and that person had a=\r\n totally different \n(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same de=\r\nity at the same \ntime. Another person felt like he became very light and wa=\r\ns floating in \nair and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another cas=\r\ne, one \nsadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his job was =\r\ndone \non earth and he could now leave. He thought, &quot;let me leave and let me=\r\n \ntake some more with me&quot;. He felt like he was a point moving up with a \ntr=\r\nemendous speed. At the same time, another person who was meditating a \nfew =\r\nfeet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling \nthat per=\r\nson forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelmed.\n\nThere are so many=\r\n possible experiences. But the key point is that \nexperiences are secondary=\r\n. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for \nspiritual progress. I had =\r\nmy share of experiences, progress and setbacks \nand I am 100% sure of the a=\r\nbove. You&#39;ll do well to remember this \nsentence and not be swayed by storie=\r\ns of experiences or desire them \nconsciously or sub-consciously. I will ela=\r\nbate a little later on the \ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.\n\n*      =\r\n  *        *\n\nEXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION\n\nWe say that god can be =\r\nknown only by experience and not by reading \nbooks. That is not incorrect. =\r\nHowever, when one is deeply desirous of an \nexperience, one may experience =\r\nan aspect of god&#39;s Delusory Power instead \nof god and that may increase fal=\r\nse pride (a true experience of god will \ninstead produce infinite humility)=\r\n. Not all experiences are equal.\n\nThere is a famous quote: An ounce of expe=\r\nrience is better than a ton of \ntheory. Though that is true in a way, it is=\r\n not complete. Even a ton of \nexperience is useless if produces a quintal o=\r\nf ego. Instead, a ton of \ntheory may actually be better if it actually redu=\r\nces one&#39;s ego to a \npound or an ounce!\n\nThe issue is not whether one needs =\r\npractical experience or theoretical \nunderstanding. That is secondary. The =\r\nprimary thing is what is happening \nto one&#39;s ego. Is it getting inflated or=\r\n deflated? THAT is undoubtedly \nthe main issue. If reading books, satsanga,=\r\n rituals, theoretical \nunderstanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal=\r\n, from a quintal to \na pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a d=\r\nirect experience, \nthat&#39;s awesome. That is better than getting a ton of exp=\r\nerience and ego \nbeing inflated from a pound to a quintal.\n\nThough it is tr=\r\nue that ego does not become complete zero without an \n&quot;experience&quot; of god i=\r\nn the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that \n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego=\r\n is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it \nto as small a quantity as yo=\r\nu can. Experience of god will then come by \nitself.\n\nIn the famous Indian m=\r\novie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is a nice line: &quot;Don&#39;t \nchase success, but chase cap=\r\nability. Success will follow automatically.&quot; \nSimilarly, don&#39;t chase experi=\r\nences, but chase detachment and deflation \nof ego. Experience will automati=\r\ncally follow. Chasing experience without \ntrying to reduce ego is like putt=\r\ning the cart before the horse. To use \nthe analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots=\r\n&quot;, one then runs the risk of \nbecoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur R=\r\namalingam (alias Silencer) \nof that movie, who chased success, ended up wit=\r\nh huge ego from limited \nsuccess and failed in the end!\n\n*        *        =\r\n*\n\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING\n\nAs said above, it is a bad idea to seek an =\r\n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego \nis still a ton or a quintal. In other words, w=\r\nhen one&#39;s conditioning is \ndense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences =\r\ncan be \ncounter-productive. The reason is that any experience will be \ninte=\r\nrpreted (and absorbed into one&#39;s system!!!) through the color of \none&#39;s con=\r\nditioning.\n\nIf I go into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I wi=\r\nll see \nthat Sun is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass=\r\n \nwindows of a house. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through \ng=\r\nreen eyeglasses. In either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am \nexperi=\r\nencing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun \nis green=\r\n&quot;.\n\nSimilarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN \n=\r\ngenerate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one&#39;s conditioning is \ncon=\r\nducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).\n\nThe key is not just to experience, but th=\r\ne ability to interpet, *digest* \nand absorb the experience into one&#39;s syste=\r\nm well. One&#39;s conditioning \ninfluences how one digests various life experie=\r\nnces, including spiritual \nexperiences and mystical experiences, like the g=\r\nreen eye glasses in the \nabove example!\n\n*        *        *\n\nDIGESTION OF =\r\nEXPERIENCES\n\nIn ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a=\r\n toxic \nbuildup in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into va=\r\nrious \ntissues and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look =\r\nand \nfeel healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one=\r\n \ndevelops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts =\r\n\nof the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food \nb=\r\neing taken in and the working of even medicines one may take in. When \ntoo =\r\nmuch ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, one may need \nto go t=\r\nhrough a painful de-toxification process.\n\nSimilarly, spiritual experiences=\r\n one cannot digest well become spiritual \nama, a toxic buildup in the subtl=\r\ne system. It can slowly build up, get \nabsorbed into various aspects of one=\r\n&#39;s being and create various diseases \nin the subtle system. In the beginnin=\r\ng, one may look and feel \nspiritually healthy despite such issues, but, whe=\r\nn too much spiritual \nama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality di=\r\nsorders. It can \neventually affect one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha=\r\n-karma (for \nde-toxification) may be far more difficult than the physical \n=\r\npancha-karma.\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS\n\nTo illustrate=\r\n what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a \n*hypothetical* =\r\nexample.\n\nSuppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates=\r\n. \nSuppose one starts to get some special inner experiences and some \nseemi=\r\nngly supernatural things start happening externally around one. \nSuppose th=\r\nese experiences give one the impression that one is special \nand one is mak=\r\ning excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one reads some \nspiritual books a=\r\nnd fantasizes &quot;becoming like Shiva&quot; mentioned in those \nbooks. Then one may=\r\n start to think &quot;may be, I have become like Shiva&quot; \nand slowly convince one=\r\nself that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one \nreads a spiritual book th=\r\nat claims &quot;If one becomes like Shiva, the whole \nuniverse connives against =\r\none who causes an offense to him&quot;.\n\nOf course, there is a context behind ev=\r\nery statement and no statement is \nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, one=\r\n may digest and absorb it into \none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one co=\r\nuld have also said, &quot;if one \nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully c=\r\no-operates with one and \nthere is no way anyone can really cause offense to=\r\n that person&quot;.\n\nAnyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one h=\r\nas indeed \nbecome like Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing =\r\noffense \nand suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shap=\r\nes in \nclouds, one can find any correlations in things happening around one=\r\n. \nOne will find a few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one \n=\r\nhas become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to people around one, \none =\r\nmay start correlating them to good and bad done by those people to \none and=\r\n/or to things one has done. Over time, the delusion may become so \ndeep tha=\r\nt it just feels so natural and obvious. This is like a serious \ndisease dev=\r\neloping from a toxic buildup of undigested or badly digested \nfood. Inabili=\r\nty to fully understand the spiritual experiences one had, \nthe fantasy of b=\r\necoming like Shiva, the pre-exising pride (like \npre-existing ama) and the =\r\nnot-so-well-digested notion that offense to \nShiva causes harm, have togeth=\r\ner created spiritual ama buildup that now \nresulted in a serious disease.\n\n=\r\nThough original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming \nlate=\r\nr on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the \nill-dig=\r\nested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is \nconducive to =\r\ncreating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of \nthe system can s=\r\npread to others.\n\nAs said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting infl=\r\nated or \ndeflated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong tra=\r\nck. \nOne is either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences du=\r\ne \nto pre-existing conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either \nc=\r\nase, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested well and is \nweaken=\r\ning the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, \nego is =\r\ngetting deflated, then one is on the right track. Whatever one is \nexperien=\r\ncing is being digested well and strengthening the system.\n\n*        *      =\r\n  *\n\nSHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES\n\nThis emphasis on ego deflation may make =\r\nsome people wonder about the \nprominence given in some books to accumulatio=\r\nn of shakti, siddhis and \nmiracles. For example, some books describe what a=\r\n being like Shiva or \nsomeone less but still with high enough shakti, can d=\r\no.\n\nYes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY =\r\n\nhave a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some special things. \nBut=\r\n, no book said that you get those abilities by being proud or \npursuing som=\r\nething that can make one proud.\n\nIn fact, if one looks at those abilities d=\r\nescribed in books and adores \nthem from one&#39;s *current* levels of dense con=\r\nditioning, it is quite akin \nto looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from green eyeglas=\r\nses and admiring the \ngreenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has miss=\r\ned the whole point. \nOne with dense conditioning can&#39;t even understand what=\r\n that shakti or \nability really means or comes from. In order to understand=\r\n what shakti \nis, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one=\r\n MUST \ndeflate one&#39;s ego.\n\nBottomline is this: Most scriptures of most reli=\r\ngions are unanimous in \nteaching the importance of humility, compassion and=\r\n ego deflation. No \nscripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflat=\r\nion. It&#39;s as \nsimple as that.\n\n*        *        *\n\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISION=\r\nS & CONVERSATIONS\n\nWe encounter some people who claim to have visions of go=\r\nds and goddesses \nand also conversations with them. When probed, there is n=\r\nothing sublime \ncoming from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever=\r\n the divine \nbeings supposedly said is well within what one consciously or =\r\n\nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nThis may r=\r\nemind one of the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character \nplayed by S=\r\nanjay Dutt in hit bollywood movie &quot;Lage Rahe Munnabhai&quot;. In \nthat movie, th=\r\ne visions are due to &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in Munnabhai&#39;s \nmind and the Gand=\r\nhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions \nthat Munnabhai himself=\r\n does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So \nthe conclusion is that th=\r\ne person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a \ncharacter in his own mind construc=\r\nted based on what Munnabhai \nunderstands of Gandhi.\n\nIn the case of divine =\r\nencounters, it may be a little different from this \nmovie. It MAY be a divi=\r\nne being one truly fancied meeting based on all \nthat one consciously and s=\r\nub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a \nreal being. Even in the latter=\r\n case, the being and his/her actions are \ninterpreted strictly based on one=\r\n&#39;s conditioning, like the &quot;green Sun&quot; \nin our previous example. So, no wond=\r\ner, in most cases, what divine \nbeings say fits well within the realm of kn=\r\nowledge one consciously or \nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wan=\r\nted to believe.\n\nIn the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditionin=\r\ng having a \nreal divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mot=\r\nher or \nfather, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understandin=\r\ng and \nwisdom.\n\nAgain, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be =\r\n\nde-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!\n\n*        *        *\n\nKUN=\r\nDALINI AWAKENING & RISE\n\nOne more thing people often talk about is Kundalin=\r\ni awakening and rise. \nKundalini shakti is that through which we are aware =\r\nof self (i.e. this \nis &quot;I&quot;). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra me=\r\nans one does not \neven question who one is and assumes the normal self-awar=\r\neness that ties \nself down to the physical body and physical senses. Howeve=\r\nr, \nself-awareness rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual \np=\r\nrogress or enlightenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of \na l=\r\nong process. If one&#39;s conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle \nideas =\r\nof who one is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the \nworld many t=\r\nimes in the past and came back to save it), an awakened \nKundalini may take=\r\n one&#39;s notion of self beyond the physical body, but \nwill get stuck somewhe=\r\nre else. In fact, one&#39;s subtle notions of self may \nbecome aggrandized when=\r\n Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may \nexperience things that ag=\r\ngravate and strengthen those notions. One may \nget badly stuck.\n\nAs mention=\r\ned above, any spiritual experience can create spiritual ama \nwhen not diges=\r\nted properly. Any pre-existing conditioning may make it \ndifficult to diges=\r\nt anything complex. Instead of eating a heavy-duty \nprotein bar that one ca=\r\nnnot digest and getting toxic buildup in the \nsystem, one is better off eat=\r\ning simple food that one&#39;s own system can \nprocess and digest well.\n\nTo be =\r\nclear, whether one&#39;s Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one&#39;s \nKundali=\r\nni is currently, is NOT a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress. As \nKundalin=\r\ni does not rise through a single path, as the rise is not linear \nand as th=\r\ne obstructions are not uniform in all people, one cannot \ncompare two peopl=\r\ne based on Kundalini experiences.\n\nOne can cling to the body and overcome a=\r\nll conditioning slowly and \noneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the wa=\r\ny to Sahasrara. Another \nperson may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck s=\r\nomewhere where it is \nextremely difficult to overcome the corresponding con=\r\nditioning.\n\nThe bottomline is that how much conditioning is overcome and ho=\r\nw reduced \none&#39;s ego is is the correct measure of spiritual progress and no=\r\nt \nwhether Kundalini is awakened and where Kundalini is.\n\n*        *       =\r\n *\n\nCORRELATIONS GALORE\n\nDo not get distracted by trying to find *correlati=\r\nons* that may or may \nnot mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell=\r\n you, &quot;wow, I was \njust thinking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something a=\r\nnd someone says, \n&quot;wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as th=\r\nough you read \nmy mind.&quot; Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in so=\r\nme region of \nthe world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad ha=\r\nppened \nthere. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did so=\r\nme \nsadhana and the desire was fulfilled.\n\nIn several such cases, correlati=\r\nng a result with something you did can \noften increase pride and your sense=\r\n of self-worth. And, doing that will \nnot enable you to do your dharma any =\r\nbetter.\n\nKeep thinking your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions a=\r\nnd \nkeep doing your sadhana. That&#39;s it. Don&#39;t correlate actions and results=\r\n \nand think that you made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and \ng=\r\nod gives results. The sense of &quot;I made X happen&quot; is conducive to pride \nand=\r\n ego inflation. Moreover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether \naction A=\r\n or B caused result X or Y, because the action-result pipeline \nhas variabl=\r\ne delay!! So, why even bother to correlate and run the risk \nof ego inflati=\r\non?\n\n*        *        *\n\nBOTTOMLINE\n\nDon&#39;t run after special experiences a=\r\nnd special abilities or anything \nthat makes you special (as you imagine cu=\r\nrrently, based on your dense \nconditioning). Spiritual progress is not abou=\r\nt becoming &quot;special&quot;, but \nabout becoming humble. Special experiences and a=\r\nbilities do not matter \nat all. In fact, they can distract one and give fal=\r\nse pride. God makes \none special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost=\r\n completely.\n\nAlso, stop correlating things happening to or around you, wit=\r\nh your \nactions, and think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actio=\r\nns is \nyour sacred duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time=\r\n is \ngod&#39;s prerogative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbib=\r\ne \nin one&#39;s thinking.\n\nRemember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningfu=\r\nl measure of \nspiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble=\r\n you become \n(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have rea=\r\nlly become \ninternally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptati=\r\nons of \nfollowing the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and h=\r\now \nwell you can follow the voice of conscience.\n\nWhen inflations in ego oc=\r\ncur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice \nit, bring it to the attentio=\r\nn and perhaps even be ruthless in belling \nthe cat [of ego]. But most gurus=\r\n now-a-days may not do that well. So, \nyou have to do your best to avoid an=\r\ny serious ego inflations.\n\nUnfortunately, the path of spiritual progress an=\r\nd self-realization IS \nvery very very likely for most of us to include many=\r\n many many \nopportunities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep=\r\n a strict \nwatch on your ego.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf I offended anybody w=\r\nith some strong assertions in this email, my \napologies.\n\nOm Tat Sat.\n\nKris=\r\nhnarapanamstu,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
