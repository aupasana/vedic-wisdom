It is a\nstate in which the senses and body are still active, but our Consciousness\nhas taken some off time.\nIn contrast meditation, our Consciousness rises up with so much power that\nthe senses are pushed back. In a good meditative state, the senses have been\ncajoled into not disturbing the Consciousness with their load, the body has\nfixed itself in a stable state, and with them both gone backstage,\nConsciousness shines as it is with all its brilliance.\n\n&gt; Sometimes while meditating i forget everything and then few seconds later\nrealise that i am here for meditation. Is it sleep or meditation?\n\n&quot;i forget everything&quot; can mean different things, and it&#39;s in general\ndifficult to express meditative experiences in words. But the above should\ngive you a clue: if you forget everything and just go blank, and then feel\nlike you&#39;ve come back after lost time, it&#39;s probably just sleep. On the\nother hand, if you forget everything material or concerning your body/mind,\nand experience your consciousness fully, if you feel very potent energy in\nthe experience, then it was meditation.\n\nHope that helps. Please point out any mistakes, I&#39;m only a humble seeker and\nmake lots of them.\n\nRegards,\nSundar\n\n-- \n! Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom.
