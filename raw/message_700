Avoiding such spices, complicated\nvegetables, meat and complex proteins such as red kidney beans etc\nand sticking to steamed rice, bread, simple proteins like moong dal\nand thoroughly cooked simple vegetables such as squash, carrots etc\nand using simple spices such as coriander powder and cumene poweder\nwill help in easy digestion and keeping jatharaagni low but\nsufficient for healthy living.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, most sadhus eat &quot;sattwik food&quot; that is nutritious, simple\nand easy to digest. This is a smart thing to do if one wants to\nincrease bhootaagni and increase the &quot;digestion&quot; of subtle spiritual\nexperience (as opposed to wasting so much energy on digestion of\nphysical food).\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Narasimha P.V.R.

But any changes have to be gradual and\nnot drastic.\n&gt;\n&gt;   When you do homam or meditation, do it on an empty stomach. Try\nto have a gap of atleast 2 hours from the time you eat and you do\nhomam/meditation. If you are doing it in the morning, do not eat\nanything before. That should help.\n&gt;\n&gt;   If there is some food being actively digested, it limits the\nbhutagni in the system and hence the spiritual experience will be\nminimized.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Do more sadhana. Spend a lot of time in homam/meditation. Even\nat other times, think of god. That will enhance bhutagni.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt;   Narasimha\n&gt;   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n&gt;   Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;   Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;   Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;   Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;   Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n&gt;\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;     From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt;     To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     Sent: Friday, November 21, 2008 2:57 AM\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Bhutagni\n&gt;\n&gt;           Dear Jitender\n&gt;\n&gt;           One effect of increasing Bhuta Agni  could be a stronger\ncapacity of visualizing things and greater concentration.\n&gt;\n&gt;           -Regards\n&gt;            Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;           &quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;           --- On Fri, 21/11/08, dahiyajiten &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;             From: dahiyajiten &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\n&gt;             Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Bhutagni\n&gt;             To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;             Date: Friday, 21 November, 2008, 12:50 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             Namaste to all\n&gt;\n&gt;             i have read that bhutaagni is very important for\n&gt;             spiritual growth\n&gt;             and for for bhutagni to grow jatharagni should be weak\n&gt;\n&gt;             and for mortals it is quite difficult to\n&gt;             weaken jatharagni as we need food for survival\n&gt;\n&gt;             Though as talked in manuals for homam,\n&gt;             homam strenghthens bhutagni ,can we something more\n&gt;             strengthning Bhutaagni\n&gt;\n&gt;             regards\n&gt;             jitender\n\n\n"}}
