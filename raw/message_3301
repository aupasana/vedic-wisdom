Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Your line of thinking is good. Faith is needed =\r\nin religion, but corruptions do take place and it is useful to question. Bl=\r\nind faith in some things is useful to make progress, but one cannot place b=\r\nlind faith in everything attributed to a religion and shun logic completely=\r\n. Truth is arrived at by a combination of reason and faith. Without faith, =\r\nonly reason cannot take one to the highest truths. Without reason, blind fa=\r\nith cannot take one to the highest truths, especially if one starts off wit=\r\nh faith in wrong notions (e.g. one may believe that you reach god if you ki=\r\nll people not belonging to one&#39;s religion).\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Fortunate is one who fi=\r\nnds the right balance between faith and reason, uses reason to find the rig=\r\nht notions to place faith in and makes quick progress.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (1) In practical physical ter=\r\nms, cow milk is a simple and nutritious food with plenty of poteins and eas=\r\ny to digest. It is very saattwik and has many useful properties as per ayur=\r\nveda.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; However, if you replace cows that live a relaxed lifestyle fe=\r\neding in open grasslands on grass and leaves with cows that live a hectic a=\r\nnd stressful lifestyle in congested factories feeding on chicken etc, the g=\r\nunas of milk are considerably different. It&#39;s not the same anymore.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt;=\r\n A cow can produce more milk than what is needed by its calf. People in the=\r\n old days never deprived calves of mother&#39;s milk and took milk after the ca=\r\nlf was fed. Instead, if one deprives the calf and steals all the milk (like=\r\n many factories may be doing), that karma will follow the milk and go to va=\r\nrious people handling, using and consuming that milk, in different proporti=\r\nons.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (2) Yes, a cloth made of silk carries a lot of negative karma.=\r\n Putting so many worms in boiling water and killing them is negative karma.=\r\n I feel far more comfortable putting in homam fire a cotton cloth made from=\r\n a tree than putting a silk cloth made by killing many worms. Though silk c=\r\nlothes are fashionable in religious ceremonies now, one cannot be sure whet=\r\nher this was a custom in ancient times or the current silk is a substitute =\r\nfor another kind of cloth made non-violently in ancient times.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; When=\r\n people cannot find something that is used traditionally, they try to find =\r\na substitute to feel good that they are following the customs. If they do n=\r\not clearly understand the motivation/rationale/spirit behind a custom, they=\r\n may end up with a bad substitute. For example, I have seen people decorati=\r\nng idols with nice looking plastic flowers and plastic flower garlands. Pla=\r\nstic is a really bad substitute for a real flower. People only use them for=\r\n decorating idols and do not put them in homam fire, but who knows, people =\r\nmay start offering plastic flowers in homam fire after a few hundred years.=\r\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Like that, silk clothes may have come into usage as a bad substitu=\r\nte for something else.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (3) Supreme god understands everything.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; The purpose of a mantra is not for requesting god for a specific thin=\r\ng. The purpose of a mantra is to stabilize an overactive mind and focus it =\r\non something. Mind is like a monkey jumping up and down and running here an=\r\nd there. Mantra is like a rope that ties it to a fixed pole (a deity or a f=\r\nocus point). As one tries to focus the mind on a deity/mantra and give up a=\r\nll other thoughts, a moment will come (perhaps after minutes of sadhana or =\r\nhours or days or years or lives) when mind will let all other thoughts go. =\r\nMind will then reverberate with the mantra, with no other thoughts in it wh=\r\natsoever. One forgets oneself completely and gets absorbed in the mantra *f=\r\nully*. That is when one *experiences* a mantra and a deity.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Such a =\r\nthing is possible with any combination of sounds. One can repeat &quot;I bow to =\r\nthe holy father&quot; for ever and reach such a state.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; However, dependin=\r\ng on the mantra being repeated in the mind and the deity being focused on, =\r\nthe experience of the mind when the mantra fills the mind and all other tho=\r\nughts cease will be different. Different mantras will give different experi=\r\nences. Various deities, their Sanskrit mantras and beejas were experimented=\r\n by many great yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. If you want=\r\n to tie a monkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope was tested=\r\n before, it may be good to use that rope.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Secondly, arrangement of =\r\nsounds in Sanskrit alphabet has a deep significance and correlation to the =\r\nsubtle body. Different sounds are vibrating in different parts of the subtl=\r\ne body. Sanskrit alphabet and mantras are constructed beautifully. When one=\r\n&#39;s self-awareness ascends from the regular plane of consciousness, one can =\r\nexperience other realms of consciousness that are vibrating with different =\r\nsounds. Sanskrit captures that well.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thirdly, each tangible article=\r\n (such as a book or an email or a mantra) has some remnants of the energy o=\r\nf persons who associated with it. When I say a specific combination of word=\r\ns, it may have one impact on you. When a saint says the same combination of=\r\n words with the same tone, it may have another impact on you. A sentence on=\r\ne writes when one is in a bad mood or bad spiritual state may not have any =\r\nimpact on readers. A sentence one writes in a very good state of mind after=\r\n a lot of sadhana and control over mind may inspire readers more\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Th=\r\nat is because one&#39;s shakti works through one&#39;s words and other tangible act=\r\nions. For this reason, mantras that were composed by great yogis or used by=\r\n great yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some of the=\r\nir shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of that=\r\n shakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras composed=\r\n by great souls like Adi Shankara.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; So it is a good idea to use well=\r\n-known Sanskrit mantras that were used by generations of great saints and y=\r\nogis.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; =A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; --- On Thu, 12/17/09, ramypras &lt;ramypras@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; From: ramypras &lt;ramypras@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Basic querie=\r\ns\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, December 17, 2009, 1=\r\n2:02 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;   =\r\n    \n&gt;       Namaskara!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have some very basic questions and was=\r\n not convinced by answers that are usually given.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. How can mil=\r\nk be considered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely being and is wor=\r\nshiped as `Kamadenu&#39;. But in actual sense we are extracting milk and preven=\r\nting the calf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin to stop a y=\r\noung calf from having milk from its mother?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. How can silk clot=\r\nh be considered sacred for worship? Silk is obtained by killing thousand&#39;s =\r\nof cocoon. Using a product which is obtained by killing so many living bein=\r\ngs and we being a cause for such an action...Are we not doing sin?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 3. I tell my daily prayers but I have not learnt Sanskrit and don&#39;t unde=\r\nrstand the meaning of many prayers that I say everyday. Why is it necessary=\r\n to say the slokas in Sanskrit and not other language??\n&gt; \n&gt; Will our Supre=\r\nme Lord not understand other languages ?? or is it just bcos Sanskrit has b=\r\neen used from the very early times it is still in practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Ram=\r\nya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
