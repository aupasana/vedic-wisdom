This list should also include saints from sufism and\n&gt; &gt; other =\r\nreligions\n&gt; &gt; We have a good history and books to refer too but we donot ha=\r\nve a \n&gt; &gt; list of top 50 or so of living saints.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I request you =\r\nall to contribute if you know and are impressed \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n This would be a good thing to have so that many of us can seek \n&gt; &gt; darsha=\r\nn and also seek guidance in future.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The idea here is about quality=\r\n and not so much about quantity \n&gt; meaning\n&gt; &gt; very reputed saints with tho=\r\nusands of disciple are already \n&gt; wellknown,\n&gt; &gt; I would not mind having th=\r\nem in the list but more important is\n&gt; &gt; realized saints who have chosen to=\r\n remain hidden or have shun\n&gt; &gt; publicity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To Start of I shal=\r\nl start with a very realized saint shri Ganapathy\n&gt; &gt; Sacchianand Swamiji o=\r\nf Mysore, a living Datta Avatar. He is the \n&gt; &gt; miracle man. I have had his=\r\n darshan in US a few times.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Once while I was on a pilgrimage to Pu=\r\nshkar about 8 years ago, I \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; visit a saint known as bengali baba,=\r\n a very realzied saint in his \n&gt; &gt; 90s. He is still alive and has built a v=\r\nery unique hanuman temple \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; Pushkar Rajasthan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was a v=\r\nery interesting meeting. He spoke bengali only and I\n&gt; &gt; spoke hindi. He sp=\r\noke for an hour. he understood all of what I said \n&gt; &gt; and asked and answer=\r\ned very sincerely in bengali in a very \n&gt; passionate \n&gt; &gt; way, however I co=\r\nuld only understand 10% when the translator was \n&gt; able \n&gt; &gt; to keep up wit=\r\nh him.\n&gt; &gt; My idea  here is to find great saints in India who are also not =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; wellknown as they may have chosen not to publize themselves too.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I thought about this because while growing up, I missed a lot of \n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nppurtunities to meet and seek darshan of many well known saints \n&gt; that \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I am finding out now about their greatness. I feel like I missed \n&gt; many =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; boats and still remain on the same shore and waiting to cross the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ocean.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope to get this list going\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; Mite=\r\nsh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
