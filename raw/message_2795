This avathara took place =\r\nduring Treta Yuga before Sri Parashurama\nAvathara. Lord Maha Vishnu took th=\r\nis avathara in order to suppress the\narrogance, vanity and pride of Emperor=\r\n Bali (Bali Chakravarthi) and to\nrestore the glory, power and authority of =\r\nLord Indra over the Heaven who had\nlost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to K=\r\ning Bali. Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama\nSthothra describes in sloka # 17 and 56, =\r\nthe Lord asUpendro Vaamanah and\nTrivikramah.*\n*Lord in this avathara was kn=\r\nown as Vamana because he was dwarf in form at\nthe beginning. He was known a=\r\ns Trivikrama because he is the one who has\nconquered the three worlds, Eart=\r\nh, Upper worlds and Nether worlds. He grew\nto a gigantic size while suppres=\r\nsing the King Bali and conquered the\nUniverse with just three paces of his =\r\nfoot. He was also referred as Upendra\nas he was known to be the younger bro=\r\nther of Indra. We find all the three\nnames Trivikrama, Vamana and Upendra w=\r\nhile reciting 24 Kesava Namas. An\nexclusive Purana named after Lord Vamana =\r\ncalled Sri Vamana Purana scripted\nby Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms part of=\r\n 18 great Puranas called Ashtadasa\nPuranas.*\n\n*Lord Vamana was born as the =\r\nson of Sage Kashyapa (Kashyapa Prajapathi) and\nhis wife Aditi in accordance=\r\n to the penance done by the couple and prayers\nof Indra and other Deities. =\r\nHe was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi day\nunder the star constellation of=\r\n Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year is\ncelebrated as Vamana Jayanthi th=\r\ne day on which Lord Sri Vamana was born. As\nsoon as he was born He took no =\r\ntime in attaining the boyhood becoming a Vatu\n(Brahmachari). Lord Brahma hi=\r\nmself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to Sri\nVamana. His attire was that of =\r\na typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing a\nKoupeena (Loin cloth), a sacred th=\r\nread, holding a Chatthra (Umbrella) in one\nhand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick=\r\n and water jug) in the other, his upper body\ncovered with Deer skin, wearin=\r\ng a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his third\nfinger.*\n**\n\n*Significance of=\r\n Three Steps*\n*Lord Vamana went to King Maha Bali and asks for three steps =\r\nof land\nmeasured by his foot as charity. Initially Bali hesitated to donate=\r\n just\nthree paces of land as it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty =\r\nto give\nsuch charity. But later agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and p=\r\nromised\nto give three paces of land as charity measured by Sri Vamana=92s f=\r\noot. When\nMaha Bali completed the ritual process of donating the land, Lord=\r\n Vamana\nassumed his cosmic form (Trivikrama), measured the entire Earth inc=\r\nluding\nthe nether worlds by his first step.*\n*\nWith his second step He meas=\r\nured the entire upper worlds. When his foot\nreached the zenith it crossed t=\r\nhe Sathya Loka where Lord Brahma stays.\nSeeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu=\r\n, Lord Brahma offered abhishekam and\nwashed the Lord=92s foot and the water=\r\n that fell from His foot sanctified the\nentire Universe. We find in the ver=\r\nses of great composer and Saint Sri\nAnnamacharya referring to the foot wash=\r\ned by Lord Brahma (Brahma Kadigina\nPadamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri=\r\n Venkateswara.*\n*\nWhen the entire Universe was conquered by just two paces =\r\nof Lord Sri Maha\nVishnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Universe to=\r\n keep Vamana=92s\nthird pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space to =\r\nkeep his third\npace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had vanished and=\r\n he had no\nhesitation in surrendering before the Supreme Lord. Having reali=\r\nsed the\nSupreme Reality, Bali readily offered his own head to keep the Lord=\r\n=92s third\nstep. Lord Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his foot) o=\r\nn the head\nof Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the ahankara (eg=\r\noism) of\nMaha Bali was suppressed and Indra was restored with his kingdom.*=\r\n\n**\n\n*Uniqueness*\n\n*Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Avathara where Lord Sr=\r\ni Maha Vishnu took\ncomplete human form though dwarf at the beginning. The u=\r\nniqueness of this\nAvathara is that the Lord did not use any weapon. The onl=\r\ny weapon he used\nwas that of begging in front of King Bali in accordance to=\r\n the Brahmanic\n(Brahmachari) form he had attained. The Lord did not kill th=\r\ne King Bali even\nthough he was an Asura. He conquered him in a Vedic way wi=\r\nth his\nintelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana Avathara was a Sattvik\n=\r\nAvathara. Lord had to resort to this strategy due to the promise he had mad=\r\ne\nto his beloved devotee Prahlada not to kill any of his descendants.\nAstro=\r\nlogically Jupiter (Guru) is said to be the Paramatma Amsa of Vamana\nAvathar=\r\na.*\n**\n*Message from Vamana Avathara\n*\n\n*Hidden behind every Avathara of Pa=\r\nramatma there is a message/moral\nconveyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the =\r\nmessage is total surrender to the\nGod however mighty one may be. When once =\r\nyou shed your ego and surrender\ntotally with devotion at the feet of the su=\r\npreme Lord there is nothing one\ncan worry about and will get total protecti=\r\non. This is what exactly has\nhappened in case of Bali who had no other alte=\r\nrnative but to surrender to\nthe Lord Trivikrama who had conquered the three=\r\n worlds.*\n*When King Bali surrendered in front of Lord Vamana with total de=\r\nvotion, the\nLord was very much pleased and gave him boons voluntarily witho=\r\nut being\nasked by King Bali. He not only made him the ruler of the nether w=\r\norld\nSuthala but also assured him that He would always protect his kingdom.=\r\n He\nalso assured Bali that he would become the Indra in the next Manvanthar=\r\na. By\nthe touch of Lord=92s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got =\r\ncleaned\nup, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi). This is what one should under=\r\nstand\nthat we should never ask for alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask you=\r\n will\nget only what you had asked. It you don=92t ask you will get everythi=\r\nng that\nyou require.*\n*\nThe story of Bali also bring out the reality that, =\r\nthere is nothing\npermanent and nothing to be taken for granted in this worl=\r\nd be it wealth,\nbeauty, power, status, position or family and nothing belon=\r\ngs to anyone.\nEven the mighty have to fall on one day or the other. We have=\r\n several such\nhistorical examples that we are also seeing in this modern wo=\r\nrld.*\n**\n\n*Festivals related to Vamana Avathara:\n*\n*The day on which Lord V=\r\namana was born is celebrated every year on\nBhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi Day as =\r\nVamana Jayanthi.*\n**\n\n*Temples of Vamana Avathara: Some of the famous templ=\r\nes of Lord Vamana are,\n*\n*Ulagalanda Perumal temple: It is a temple of Lord=\r\n Sri Maha Vishnu in\nTrivikrama roopa (Vamana Avathara).
