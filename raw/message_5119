Havan and Homa are terms used to refer to small yajnas. Both havan an=\r\nd homa can be performed by the individual and do not need a priest unlike a=\r\n yajna.  Yajna is medium to large scale and needs anywhere from 3 to 16 pri=\r\nests depending on the specificity of the ritual. Kratu is even larger in te=\r\nrms of duration, complexity and scale. Now let me address the most importan=\r\nt part of your query wrt certain verses of the 3rd chapter in B. Gita. I wi=\r\nll give an overview of Yajna in its various forms as embodied in Hinduism, =\r\ntracing its evolution in the sastras.\n\n \nIn the Rig Veda it first appears a=\r\ns an instrument and objective, more as a concept, as an outcome of will and=\r\n contemplation. In the Yajurveda it is clearly described as a ritual. The K=\r\nalpa Sutras treat it as a conduct. The Upanishads as well as the B. Gita pr=\r\nesent a vedantic version while the Puranas give it a literally embodied phy=\r\nsical form in their characteristic mythological style. The Tantras reveal a=\r\nn even more personal and internal version of yajna.\n \nThe word `yajna&#39; is d=\r\nerived from the root verb `yaj&#39; which has three possible meanings:\n \n1.\t`to=\r\n worship&#39;, \n2.\t`to unite or congregate&#39; \n3.\t`to give&#39;         \n\nAccordingly=\r\n `yajna&#39; can mean:\n\n1.\tA ritual as in yaga    \n2.\tUnification or congregati=\r\non of people, sangatikaran\n3.\tGiving or offering\n\nWhilst the Vaidik yajna a=\r\ns a ritual has all these aspects to it, the Upanishads (whose spirit and es=\r\nsence the B.Gita crystallizes most beautifully) and Tantras transform the c=\r\noncept of Yajna into an inner phenomenon.\n  \nLet us first examine Yajna as =\r\na universal phenomenon. All of nature is in a cyclic phenomenon wherein all=\r\n parts of the universe are interdependent for their sustenance and growth. =\r\nFor instance trees receive the essence required for their growth from the e=\r\narth and atmosphere apart from sunlight, but give their fruits to other sen=\r\ntient beings. However this act of giving is not for oneself, not a calculat=\r\ned self-motivated act. Nor is it in return for what has been received. That=\r\n is why it is called a sacrifice. Be it the food chain or rain or anything =\r\nelse in nature, everything is in an interdependent, cyclic phenomenon of sa=\r\ncrifice. The rishis intuited the phenomenon of yajna and the spirit of sacr=\r\nifice both in the external universe as well as in the depths of their own c=\r\nonsciousness. They realized that the spirit of yajna/sacrifice had to be th=\r\ne foundation of all karmas whether they are for the creation of wealth or f=\r\nor any other goal of life. Thus Yajna becomes not just a way of life but TH=\r\nE way of life. Applying the spirit of sacrifice to human ACTIONS paves way =\r\nto at least two versions.\n\n \n1.\tThe first is an external emulation of the p=\r\nrinciple of Yajna through Ritual based action. This is the external yajna o=\r\nr Dravya Yajna, yajna as an actual ritual. This is the grosser level of yaj=\r\nna\n\n2.\tThe second is a more refined form of sacrifice that does not involve=\r\n physical oblations in the sacrificial fire. It involves discharging one&#39;s =\r\nduties by interacting in the world keeping the spirit of yajna in the heart=\r\n. Done with the spirit of yajna every action becomes an oblation in the Kar=\r\nma yajna.\n  \nBy now we have examined three forms of Yajna.\n \n1.\tThe Cosmic =\r\nform of Yajna or Yajna in Nature- Paroksha yajna\n2.\tExternal yajna or Dravy=\r\na yajna or Ritual Yajna\n3.\tKarma yajna \n\nThe picture is however not yet com=\r\nplete. Yajna is revealed as a concept, as a phenomenon in the Veda Samhita.=\r\n It is perfected as a Ritual in the Brahmana texts. The Aranyakas which res=\r\nulted from the retired forest dwellers&#39; secluded and introspective lifestyl=\r\ne emphasise that external yajna can and should stimulate a parallel INTERNA=\r\nL process (yajnasya antarangah). The Upanishads finally crystallize the ess=\r\nence of Yajna as a philosophy of life, nay as THE way of life as the B. Git=\r\na too upholds. This refinement inevitably paved way to the development of t=\r\nhe INTERNAL yajna. This is the fourth version of Yajna.\n \nThe Pranagnihotra=\r\n Upanishad establishes the equivalence between parts of the physical yajna =\r\nand parts of the human body. There is a one on one equivalence of all parts=\r\n: The atma is the yajamana, shraddha (faith) is the patni (yajamana&#39;s wife)=\r\n, body is the fuel (samidha) and so on. In the Chandogya Upanishad, yajna b=\r\necomes the journey of the soul in this life. The soul is of course the yaja=\r\nmana. All the sense organs assemble or congregate in the body to help the y=\r\najamana perform the yajna and are therefore the ritvijs (priests). The soul=\r\n can never be inactive as long as it is associated with a mortal body. Acti=\r\nons emanate inevitably from the mind, sense organs and body. Thus yajna mea=\r\nns the totality of actions performed by the individual throughout life. In =\r\nother words the whole of life is a Yajna. In fact the Chandogya Upanishad e=\r\nven divides life into three parts and allocates specific objectives to the =\r\nthree parts, based on the three savannas of the srauta yajna. Even the life=\r\n span is calculated as 116 years based on the metres of the mantras used in=\r\n the three savannas. The Chandogya Upanishad exhorts us to undertake auster=\r\nities with the spirit of service to others as the basis of all actions. \n\n\n=\r\nYajna is undoubtedly one of the prescribed duties of religious life. In the=\r\n past generally it was the kings and wealthy people who used to perform yaj=\r\nnas and kratus as it requires large amount of wealth as well as the service=\r\ns of many people. But what about the common man? Moreover even if one can a=\r\nfford to do yajnas and homas is it truly possible to do external yajnas con=\r\nsistently on a regular basis in our times? Also can one limit the aim of ya=\r\njna to mere material prosperity and attaining the higher swargaloka, as aff=\r\nirmed by the Purvamimamsakas? The vedic literature as an interrelated body =\r\nanswers all these questions progressively as one studies the Aranyakas as w=\r\nell as the Upanishads. In fact it is here that every idea and concept reach=\r\nes its most sublime interpretation.\n\n\nIt is first affirmed that even if one=\r\n cannot actually do yajna karma as prescribed by the Vedas, one can still r=\r\neap the fruit of the yajna karma chanting the respective riks of the respec=\r\ntive ritual -yam yam kratumadheete tena tenaasyeshtam bhavati (Taittiriya A=\r\nranyaka, 2. 15). It is thus the spirit of yajna that is more important than=\r\n the ritual itself, not withstanding the power of mantras. The Smrtis give =\r\nus alternate options such as `Dana&#39;, whilst the Upanishads lay emphasis on =\r\nthe spirit of yajna, on the philosophy behind the phenomenon of yajna, thus=\r\n inculcating the attitude that our very life itself is a yajna. \n\nThe B. Gi=\r\nta takes the phenomenon of Yajna to new heights by expounding Karma yoga in=\r\n the spirit of Yajna. Considering the difficulties of people in the difficu=\r\nlt Kali yuga, Sri Krishna gives us the most pragmatic interpretation of Yaj=\r\nna without compromising on its spiritual foundation. His interpretation is =\r\nwithin the reach of the common man, rich or poor, learned or illiterate, ma=\r\nn or woman. This form of yajna requires neither wealth nor external help fr=\r\nom others. Each of us can perform it under all conditions of life. This Yaj=\r\nna is none other than Karma Yajna presented as Karma Yoga. Nishkama karma o=\r\nr selfless actions, actions performed without attachment to the results, se=\r\nlfless service, these are the mainstay of this Maha yajna. Any work done wi=\r\nth the constant remembrance of God is transformed into a sacred sacrifice. =\r\nAny and every action of the worldly life can be transformed into a great ya=\r\njna if one follows the spirit of Karma yoga. Arjuna himself sublimated a bl=\r\noody war into a great yajna by keeping the Lord constantly in his heart. In=\r\n fact he had the great fortune of keeping the Lord in front of him. To the =\r\ndiligent and discerning student of the B. Gita the references are in abunda=\r\nnce and the guidance quite clear. Krishna considers repetition of God&#39;s nam=\r\ne, self-study of sacred texts, control of the senses and selfless service a=\r\ns all various forms of yajna. \n\nIn the fourth chapter (Jnana Yoga) Sri Kris=\r\nhna clearly reveals the wide and varied sadhanas of Yajna (B. Gita, 4, 24-3=\r\n3). He extends the application of the principle of yajna from its external =\r\nritualistic limited usage to its great and varied application as a way of l=\r\nife enabling each of us to take to the practices that are suited to our apt=\r\nitudes, needs and capabilities. Please study the Gita completely and you wi=\r\nll find many references to various kinds of yajna- dravya yajna, indriya sa=\r\nnyam yajna, tapo yajna, yoga yajna, prana yajna, swadhyaya yajna and jnana =\r\nyajna. Revealing so many alternate ways to perform Yajna, Sri Krishna has e=\r\nxpanded the scope of Yajna to such dimension and depth that it is not only =\r\ncomprehensive and spiritually uncompromising, but also pragmatic and within=\r\n the reach of everyone. What&#39;s more! The fruits of this mahayajna are not m=\r\nere material prosperity or heavenly abodes, but infinitesimally bigger. In =\r\na way yajnas performed for the fulfillment of desires lead to further bonda=\r\nge. But the Karma Yajna prescribed by Sri Krishna has the power to cut asun=\r\nder the bonds of even karma. Anasakta or Nishkama karma yoga as a way of li=\r\nfe can eventually raise us to the original state of awareness and freedom. =\r\n                  \n\nWhile there are other facets to Yajna that are not nece=\r\nssary at the level or context of this discussion, the picture presented so =\r\nfar is incomplete in so far as the various sadhana margas of Hinduism are c=\r\noncerned without at least a passing reference to Tantra marga. As already s=\r\ntated in the other thread on initiation, mantramarga etc Tantra internalize=\r\ns the whole journey within the lab of consciousness. The Agni of the Yajna =\r\nbecomes the Chidagni within the individual. In the internal yajna, the spin=\r\nal cord becomes the arani. Just as fire is ignited at the bottom of the ara=\r\nni in external yajna, the internal fire is ignited at the bottom or at the =\r\nroot (mooladhara) where the reservoir or fire-pit or `kunda&#39; exists. Those =\r\nfamiliar with the Lalitasahasranama will identify `chit agni kunda sambhuta=\r\n&#39; as one of her names. She is none other than the Sakti within the individu=\r\nal consciousness. Since the sakti resides in a dormant form in that kunda, =\r\nshe is referred to as Kundalini sakti. Thus the Kalagni (cosmic level) of t=\r\nhe Veda samhita becomes the Kundalini in the Tantras. Just as Kalagni, Lauk=\r\nikagni and Yajnagni are different levels of Agni, so too are the fire of in=\r\ntellect/buddhi, the fire of speech, the fire of austerity etc various equiv=\r\nalents of the functions of Agni in the internal yajna whilst Kundalini rema=\r\nins the internal Yajnagni. I will stop here as further intellectualization =\r\nis neither required nor recommended in such matters.\n\n                \nBefo=\r\nre wrapping up, I will recap the various meanings of the root verb `yaj&#39;.\n =\r\n\n1.\t`to worship&#39;, \n2.\t`to unite or congregate&#39; \n3.\t`to give&#39;         \n\nThou=\r\ngh I cannot trace in detail now, I will indicate this much. The all-importa=\r\nnt `Satsangha&#39; can be partly traced to the second facet/meaning of yajna as=\r\n a union or congregation. Likewise the third facet/meaning of yajna is take=\r\nn up predominantly by the Puranas in fleshing out the practice of `Dana&#39;. O=\r\nne has to bear in mind that each of these practices has the other facets of=\r\n yajna too inbuilt into it as all the three meanings are interrelated in th=\r\ne larger phenomenon of Yajna.\n\n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash \n\n\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, manish gour &lt;manishgo_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Nagraj,\n&gt; \n&gt; From my little=\r\n understanding : &quot;Yagna&quot; is a much more broader concept than just doing hom=\r\nam.\n&gt; \n&gt; What Krishna essentially means is that just don&#39;t say &quot;idam na mam=\r\nah&quot;, you need to act that way too i.e. you need to keep giving back to the =\r\nnature. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 20/10/10, nagraj@... &lt;nagraj=\r\n_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: nagraj@... &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] karma yoga per geeta\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednes=\r\nday, 20 October, 2010, 4:17 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Dear everyone, \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have ju=\r\nst realized that geeta in the chapter karma yoga, constantly talks about ya=\r\ngna (homa?) as the main activity and also asserts that whoever is not doing=\r\n homa is just adding his karma all the time. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, 3.9 =\r\nstates that \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karmabandhanah=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  tadartham karma kaunteya mukasangah samachara&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; which roug=\r\nhly translates to &quot;karmas other than those for yagna (homa) are only going =\r\nto increase the bondage and hence you should only that karma that is meant =\r\nfor yagna&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now this in arjuna&#39;s case means that he should just =\r\ndo the war, as that is his yagna! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In my case, does that mean th=\r\nat I should leave my job as a software engineer and keep doing homas, and c=\r\nhanting vedam as that is my vihita karma as I am a brahmin by birth? \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Verse 13 also goes to say that I am only eating sin if I am doing som=\r\nething outside of vedam to get my bread, which I am clearly doing by workin=\r\ng as an IT professional in the USA!
