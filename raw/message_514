Navami is on \nWednesday (Oct=\r\n 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; If one&#39;s parents did =\r\nnot do a proper &quot;anna praasana&quot; ritual (the \nritual of first feeding of sol=\r\nid food to a baby) to one, should one \nconsider oneself not entitled to eat=\r\n any solid food? Not doing a \nmantra because of no initiation is basically =\r\nlike that.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Getting initiation is good, especially if the o=\r\nne initiating has \nsome level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neither =\r\nnecessary \nnor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana.\n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; If you see my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A \nmilli=\r\nonaire may open a bank account in his son&#39;s name with a \nstarting balance o=\r\nf a million dollars. This is akin to a good guru \ninitiating a sishya in a =\r\nmantra. Sishya starts off by getting some \nof guru&#39;s attainment. But the so=\r\nn may waste those million dollars \nand end up with nothing. Similarly the s=\r\nishya may fall and not \nachieve anything. Another person may not have anyon=\r\ne to give money \nand may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate =\r\nmillions \nof dollars with own effort. This is akin to=C3=82=C2=A0a person d=\r\noing sadhana \nwith a mantra without guru and attaining some level in the ma=\r\nntra.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Some people hold the view that mantras cannot be cha=\r\nnted without a \nproper &quot;initiation&quot; . This view is especially prevalent in =\r\nsome \nsections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with \n=\r\nthat view.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; If you know the mantra (!), just chant it. What=\r\n would an \ninitiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given som=\r\ne of \nhis attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if =\r\n\nyou work hard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taught you the right nyasas to be \ndone =\r\nbefore the mantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. \nMoreover, =\r\nwhat most people do today for nyasas is anyway just a \nritual with no meani=\r\nng. Nyasa literally means placement. You place \nvarious sounds in various b=\r\nody parts (like the tips of various \nfingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc)=\r\n. People merely act out some \nsignals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placem=\r\nent&quot; is actually \nsupposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal en=\r\nvironment \nfor the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what =\r\nis \nsupposed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds \nend=\r\n up not getting properly placed in the body. In other words, what \nI am try=\r\ning to say is that most people do\n&gt; not know how to &quot;place&quot; various &quot;sounds=\r\n&quot; in various body parts. \nThey merely perform meaningless ritualistic actio=\r\nns. So, if you do \nnot know nyasas, you are not really missing much compare=\r\nd to others \nwho were initiated.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; In my humble opinion, the=\r\n most important qualification is to have \ndevotion and sense of surrender t=\r\no Her. If you have them, you can \nconsider yourself &quot;highly initiated&quot;.\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- ----\n-----\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.co=\r\nmcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----\n----- \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Chandra Prakash \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 05, 2008 11:16 PM\n&gt; Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Navaratri...\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; When does Navratri end?=\r\n It started on last Monday, September 29, \n2008 and should therefore end on=\r\n Tuesday, October 7, 2008 (Nine \nNights)...yet the panchang shows that at s=\r\nunrise on Wednesday, \nOctober 8 starts with Navami, so should we continue o=\r\nur Navratri on \nWednesday too even though it is technically the 10th day?

Same with &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Sudama.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One poet has narrated that episode in simple but beautiful =\r\nwords in &lt;BR&gt;Hindi. it goes like this&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Dekhi Sudaamaa ki Deen dasha,=\r\n Karuna Karake Karunaa-Nidhi roye !&lt;BR&gt;Pani paratko haath chhuyo nahi, Nain=\r\nan ke Jal se Pagu dhoye&quot; !!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It means- Krishna cried looking at the =\r\ncondition of his poor friend &lt;BR&gt;and didn&#39;t use water from the vessels but =\r\nused his Tears to wash the &lt;BR&gt;feet of Sudaamaa.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;that sums up all.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope Rao garu will provide today with Technical details and &lt;BR&gt;Mea=\r\nning behind *various Nyaasa* for the benefit of all on this &lt;BR&gt;special day=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again wish\n you all a very happy Drgaashtami.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;best regards,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, nalini swamy &lt;nalini2818@ =\r\n...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hare Rama Krsna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Sri Narasimha garu,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaskar.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Deep gratitude to have r=\r\neassured me/us. I had started the &lt;BR&gt;Navaratri Puja of The Mother with Kal=\r\nasam. As I have not been &lt;BR&gt;initiated into the pooja vidhanam and only had=\r\n the fortune of &lt;BR&gt;witnessing the ritualistic pooja done by my mother-in-l=\r\naw according &lt;BR&gt;to Sri sooktam. Unfortunately I was not a great fan of rit=\r\nuals then. &lt;BR&gt;I live abroad and downloaded the pooja vidhanam according to=\r\n sri &lt;BR&gt;sooktam and started my pooja. I found that it was pertaining to &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Durga and the shodasopachara pooja and the pranapratishta. The Devi &lt;BR&gt;K=\r\navacham and the Sapta\n sloki are also included. When I started the &lt;BR&gt;pooj=\r\na I wondered if I could chant and perform the pooja as it was a &lt;BR&gt;part of=\r\n Saptashati. My father-in-law advised me not to do it as I &lt;BR&gt;was not init=\r\niated. But having started and I also strongly believe &lt;BR&gt;that Mother would=\r\n not &#39;harm&#39; her child=C3=82&nbsp; I have continued with Her &lt;BR&gt;Grace. I ha=\r\nve always wanted to do SaptaShati parayanam during the &lt;BR&gt;sarannaNavaratra=\r\ns. How can I correct my swara? As I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; am not very familiar with Sansk=\r\nrit and afraid of not doing it &lt;BR&gt;properly, is there a way?

If you look at the nights =\r\nbefore Vijaya Dasami, then &lt;BR&gt;there are ten nights instead of nine this ye=\r\nar. This happens &lt;BR&gt;sometimes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you live on=\r\n US east coast, then Chaturthi comes twices on &lt;BR&gt;Thursday and Friday (Oct=\r\n 2 &amp; 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and &lt;BR&gt;extended into Friday. Pa=\r\nnchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was &lt;BR&gt;on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami=\r\n is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on &lt;BR&gt;Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami is on Th=\r\nursday (Oct\n 10).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one&#39;s parents did not do =\r\na proper &quot;anna praasana&quot; ritual (the &lt;BR&gt;ritual of first feeding of solid f=\r\nood to a baby) to one, should one &lt;BR&gt;consider oneself not entitled to eat =\r\nany solid food? Not doing a &lt;BR&gt;mantra because of no initiation is basicall=\r\ny like that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Getting initiation is good, espec=\r\nially if the one initiating has &lt;BR&gt;some level of sadhana in that mantra. B=\r\nut it is neither necessary &lt;BR&gt;nor sufficient for making progress in your o=\r\nwn sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you see my homam document, I ga=\r\nve an analogy for this. A &lt;BR&gt;millionaire may open a bank account in his so=\r\nn&#39;s name with a &lt;BR&gt;starting balance of a million dollars. This is akin to =\r\na good guru &lt;BR&gt;initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya starts off by getti=\r\nng some &lt;BR&gt;of guru&#39;s attainment. But the son may waste those million dolla=\r\nrs &lt;BR&gt;and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and not &lt;BR&gt;a=\r\nchieve anything.\n Another person may not have anyone to give money &lt;BR&gt;and =\r\nmay start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions &lt;BR&gt;of dolla=\r\nrs with own effort. This is akin to=C3=82&nbsp;a person doing sadhana &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nith a mantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some people hold the view that mantras cannot be chant=\r\ned without a &lt;BR&gt;proper &quot;initiation&quot; . This view is especially prevalent in=\r\n some &lt;BR&gt;sections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree wi=\r\nth &lt;BR&gt;that view.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you know the mantra (!), =\r\njust chant it. What would an &lt;BR&gt;initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps=\r\n he would&#39;ve given some of &lt;BR&gt;his attainment in the mantra to you. Well, y=\r\nou can do it yourself if &lt;BR&gt;you work hard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taught you t=\r\nhe right nyasas to be &lt;BR&gt;done before the mantra. Well, you can get the nya=\r\nsas from books too. &lt;BR&gt;Moreover, what most people do today for nyasas is a=\r\nnyway just a &lt;BR&gt;ritual\n with no meaning. Nyasa literally means placement. =\r\nYou place &lt;BR&gt;various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of variou=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;signals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placement&quot; is actually &lt;BR&gt;suppose=\r\nd to be an internal act and it creates an ideal environment &lt;BR&gt;for the rep=\r\netition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what is &lt;BR&gt;supposed to occ=\r\nur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds &lt;BR&gt;end up not getting =\r\nproperly placed in the body. In other words, what &lt;BR&gt;I am trying to say is=\r\n that most people do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not know how to &quot;place&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in va=\r\nrious body parts. &lt;BR&gt;They merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. =\r\nSo, if you do &lt;BR&gt;not know nyasas, you are not really missing much compared=\r\n to others &lt;BR&gt;who were initiated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In my humbl=\r\ne opinion, the most important qualification is to have &lt;BR&gt;devotion and sen=\r\nse of surrender to\n Her. If you have them, you can &lt;BR&gt;consider yourself &quot;h=\r\nighly initiated&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n----&lt;BR&gt;-----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedi=\r\ncast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ =\r\nhomam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ &lt;BR&gt;tar=\r\npana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- ----&lt;BR&gt;----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Origi=\r\nnal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Chandra Prakash &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 05, 2008 11:16 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Navaratri...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When does Navratri end?
