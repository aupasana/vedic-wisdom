I have no idea how long one needs to do it. It depends on h=\r\now big the pile is and how big one&#39;s shovel is. In other words, the hea=\r\nviness of the karmas blocking one and the intensity of the remedial measure=\r\ns decide when one breaks through. It may be a day or a decade or whatever.&lt;=\r\nu&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;For material concerns related to finances, usually worship of =\r\nGanapathi or Lakshmi is recommended. Homam of Lakshmi with Kanaka Dhara Sot=\r\nram (composed by Adi Shankara) is a good option, but I was asked by my guru=\r\n not to include it in Mahalakshmi homam manual as one of the options. But o=\r\nne can download the stotram from the web and use it. One needs to just add =\r\nswaahaa at the end of each verse and make offerings.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;There are=\r\n billions of really really\n suffering human\n beings (and many many more oth=\r\ner beings) on this earth. When I read news sometimes, my heart gets wrenche=\r\nd. But, unfortunately, there is nothing I can do, except praying to Her to =\r\ngive conviction and direction to those suffering, so that they can eventual=\r\nly find their way out of their misery.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;I hope some divine forc=\r\ne will show you the right direction. Doing some sadhana sincerely for a whi=\r\nle is a great thing in this age. I hope some benefit accrues.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;=\r\nBest regards,&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Narasimha&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;--------&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Astrology &amp; Spiritua=\r\nlity Resources: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;--------&lt;u&gt;&lt;/=\r\nu&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3D&quot;no=\r\nfollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Bhupen=\r\ndra Jamnadas wrote:&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha Ji,&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&gt; Do you have\n no advice?
