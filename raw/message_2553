I mean once lets say Ganapathi homam is done and after t=\r\nhe completion can I perform Sani Homam in the same fire by following the st=\r\neps from the beginning.\n\n2) If yes are there any separate procedure to be d=\r\none before switching from one homam to another?\n\n3) For Sani homam I know y=\r\nou have mentioned white snd black sesame seeds . But is there any other spe=\r\ncial items that can be offered in the homam spdecially for Sani.\n\n4) For po=\r\nornahuti are there any additional special materials that can be used. \nThan=\r\nks and Regards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
