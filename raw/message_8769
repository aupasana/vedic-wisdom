However in temples I =\r\nhave seen that whenever there is a Chandi Homam, 10 people sit down to reci=\r\nte the entire Durga Saptashati (Chandi Path). Then one person offers the ah=\r\nuti. This technically fulfils the 10:1 requirement. However one thing to re=\r\nmember is that such activities in temples are not generally done for one&#39;s =\r\nindividual spiritual progress. Rather it is sponsored by a person for his l=\r\nowkika &quot;desired&quot; fruits. Also when done from the temple itself, it is gener=\r\nally done for the betterment of the community, society etc. \n\nMy 2 cents.\n\n=\r\nRegards,\nAshutosh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;ved=\r\nic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Ashutosh,\n&gt; \n&gt; Very interesting informati=\r\non mainly because it came via Ashtamangal Prashna.\n&gt; \n&gt; Til to be mixed atl=\r\neast with some Ghee and not to be offered Dry and for that matter any mater=\r\nial - This is a kind of Indication to me as well. during my today&#39;s ashtami=\r\n Full fledged Chandi Havan, I did stopped for a momoent to think mixing of =\r\nWhite Til with ghee. I did not do it eventually though but your post is a k=\r\nind of confirmation signal for me atleast. Narasimha Garu normally indicate=\r\ns that whatever one offer in Ahuti should not be completely dry. once he su=\r\nggested me that if i offer Cowdung cakes as Ahuti, then i dhould dip that i=\r\nn ghee and offer. so this thing is very clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2ndly, I wish to unders=\r\ntand about &quot;Chandi Path verses&quot; which are recited while offering Ahuti iN C=\r\nhandi Homas. How one ought to apply the rule of 10:1 or 100:1 in such cases=\r\n? any Idea you have or you can get?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you again for the post and H=\r\nappy Durgaashtami to all!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikanth&quot; &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; &gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more tha=\r\nn a year and half.\n&gt; &gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan =\r\nso that it can be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; &gt; I am using a conve=\r\nrsation that in fact took place to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sometime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am pre=\r\nsenting below: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ash=\r\nTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called =\r\nas dosha.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... =\r\nlet me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni kary=\r\na at your home regularly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surpris=\r\ned by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the havan =\r\nI did at home)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the =\r\nagni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And yo=\r\nur ahuti does not seem to be right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (se=\r\nsame seeds).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a=\r\n little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And wha=\r\nt is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do =\r\nyou do required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the=\r\n same mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... =\r\nRequired Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-def=\r\nined set of japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti =\r\nratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via medit=\r\nation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dasham=\r\nsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualifi=\r\ned to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa=\r\n (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is alrea=\r\ndy familiar with that book series)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applie=\r\ns to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is=\r\n always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne conversation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to ge=\r\nt mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and als=\r\no using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ra=\r\ntio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I j=\r\nust wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at leas=\r\nt 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for=\r\n the ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
