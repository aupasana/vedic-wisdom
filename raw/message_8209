After marriage,\nthis changes to the aupAsana homa. Given that th=\r\ne upanayana is usually\nperformed at a young age (8-12), our tradition expec=\r\nts children in\nthis age group to perform a simple homa.\n\n\n&gt; I know I am not=\r\n supposed to put anything inside the kunda.\n\n\nThe karmas of parent and chil=\r\nd are strongly intertwined, especially\nwhen the child is young and depends =\r\nwholly on the parent. As it is,\nyou are already feeding his outward senses,=\r\n and are filling his\nstomach. Putting something in the kunda in the beginni=\r\nng is fine. He\nwill quickly learn to do it for himself, in a matter of days=\r\n.\n\n\n&gt; Will I be putting pressure on them .....\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t they experience =\r\nthe life in fullest form\n\n\nAgain, we can simply look at our tradition and i=\r\nt&#39;s history. The\nupanayana is performed in childhood, and these children co=\r\nntinued to\nstudy and make wonderful contributions to society in many areas\n=\r\n(music, astrology, mathematics, poetry etc). They got married, had\nchildren=\r\n, become retired etc. However you define &quot;experiencing life&quot;,\nthey probably=\r\n did it.\n\nsasneham,\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n"}}
