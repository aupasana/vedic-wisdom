He was 80 years\nold a=\r\nnd had served in Sri Ramanasramam since his youth. His departure has\nsadden=\r\ned all those who have benefited by his devotion and service all these\ndecad=\r\nes. In his usual modest manner, Appachi Mama briefly described his life\nin =\r\na recent video interview. The following text has been extracted from this\ni=\r\nnterview.\n\nI joined the Ashram Vedapatasala on January 8, 1942 and finished=\r\n my course\nin 1950. During those years the Patasala boys had to perform mos=\r\nt of the\nAshram chores. This included assisting the priest in the Mother=E2=\r\n=80=99s temple,\ncleaning the kitchen after every meal, grinding the coffee =\r\nbeans every\nevening, shifting huge vessels from the fire, spreading rice fo=\r\nr mixing at\nthe poor feeding, serving the devotees and the servants. The re=\r\nst of the\ntime we had our Veda lessons.\n\nOnce, while serving Bhagavan and o=\r\nthers, Bhagavan asked for some more\nbuttermilk. I went to the kitchen and t=\r\nook the bucket containing the\nbuttermilk and served Bhagavan, not knowing t=\r\nhat this was the sour\nbuttermilk which was put aside for the servants. Bhag=\r\navan drank the\nbuttermilk and never said anything. But the kitchen staff to=\r\nok me to task. I\nwas shocked to know that inadvertently I served sour butte=\r\nrmilk to Bhagavan.\nI was too shy and frightened to face him. Even during th=\r\ne morning and\nevening Veda Parayana in the hall I sat at a distance from hi=\r\nm and at meals\navoided serving him. However, after two days had passed and =\r\nfinding that he\ndid not mention anything about the incident I took courage =\r\nand started\nserving him again.\n\nIn 1950 after Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Maha Nirva=\r\nna, I joined a secondary school and after\nfinishing the eighth standard I t=\r\nook a teachers training course. I then\nserved as a teacher for three years =\r\nin Tirukoilur and Tanjore. At the time\nmy pay was 45 rupees per month. Kris=\r\nhnamurthy (Kittu), who was working as a\npriest in the Ashram, wrote to me a=\r\nnd asked me to return to serve in the\nAshram with a salary of only 15 rupee=\r\ns per month. Though the pay was low, I\nthought it was a call from Bhagavan =\r\nhimself to serve him, and heeding this\ncall resigned my job, came and settl=\r\ned at the Ashram.\n\nIn those days the Ashram income was insufficient and irr=\r\negular.\nConsequently, we used to be paid only when there were enough funds.=\r\n These\ndays, of course, even before the end of the month we get our pay. Th=\r\nings\nhave changed considerably.\n\nAs the electrician and plumber would not c=\r\nome to the Ashram when called, I\nalso took up that work. I did most of the =\r\nelectrification and plumbing to\nthe newly built cottages. I also had to pre=\r\npare naivedya, do the grinding\nwork for the temple, go to the town for coll=\r\necting papers, get signatures\nfrom the trustees maintaining accounts, etc. =\r\nAll these responsibilities\ndevolved on me. Later on the situation improved =\r\nand the Ashram had its own\nplumber and electrician, and the other jobs were=\r\n taken over by the office\nstaff. In this manner, I have been at the service=\r\n of Bhagavan for more than\n50 years.\n\nSRI N.
