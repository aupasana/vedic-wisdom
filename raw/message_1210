The words in the first half of this \nmantra, and the\n&gt; first two p=\r\nadas of the gayatri have a strong correspondence. It is \ncertainly\n&gt; a pote=\r\nnt mantra which will provide true spiritual upliftment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a tran=\r\nslation based on the commentary of the Rishi \nShaunaka -- We\n&gt; pray to the =\r\neye of all three. (i.e. sadAshiva, who is the \nprogenitor of\n&gt; brahma, vish=\r\nnu and rudra). He has the sweet fragrance (earned by \nthe punya\n&gt; of his go=\r\nod works). He nourishes us (by providing us with the \nshakti that\n&gt; underli=\r\nes the entire cosmic creation). (Through his grace,) we are \nliberated\n&gt; fr=\r\nom death (i.e. samsara, the cycle of life and death) and are \nlead to\n&gt; (sA=\r\nyujya) mokSha, just as the cucumber detaches itself from its \nplant.\n&gt; \n&gt; b=\r\nhavadIyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt;          ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
