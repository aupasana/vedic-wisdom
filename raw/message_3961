Ho=\r\nw ever, I have few observations regarding the analogies.\n\n1. In all the anl=\r\nogies, we know what it feels like when we reach the goal. We know what it i=\r\ns like to have a Job. We know what it is like to reach the bank. We also kn=\r\now how made not reaching the goal. No job, typically means no money and res=\r\nults normally in misery. No reaching sea bank normally means death out of s=\r\ntarvation. But, the same is not the case with spiritual jouney.\n\nMost of us=\r\n do not know what it is to see God. After all, if I finally realise and God=\r\n and merge, there is no more happyness/sadness. It is supposed to be a stat=\r\ne of Nirguna. Also, we hear so much that we should strive to treat happynes=\r\ns/saddness, praise/disgrace equally. If one can react to sadness as one do =\r\nto happyness, there is no further problem. God or no God, such a state is d=\r\nefinitely good to be in. But, this also means, I do not enjoy happyness. Wh=\r\nat is the difference between an non living being and me in such a case?\n\n2.=\r\n In sea, when you have to row a long distance to reach a bank, you have lim=\r\nited energy left with you. So, the key is not to loose hope and courageand =\r\nreevaluate the strategy to reach the bank faster. At times, it may be best =\r\nto sleep that row against wind. The key to to get maximum return for the en=\r\nergy you spend since you have limited energy left with you. It depends how =\r\nclose you are from bank. If I can see bank, then perhaps rowing with my ful=\r\nl strength may be a good idea, but, if I know for sure, I am very far from =\r\nbank, I am bettere off letting wind take me some where and concentrate on s=\r\nurving for longer - I may use my strength to find some food for me than row=\r\ning and weaking myself.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajesh,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me =\r\nchange the track from homam to material things, in order to address the &quot;go=\r\nd decides everything&quot; notion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What i am trying to ask you here is..=\r\n I was born on fix date..so\n&gt; &gt; as i am going to die on any fix date only..=\r\n it is all decided....\n&gt; &gt; Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, failures ev=\r\nerything about me\n&gt; &gt; is decided by god  well in advance.. it is like a fil=\r\nm.. my end\n&gt; &gt; is already decided.. but i amnot aware of this.. so Doing ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; &gt; will help me changing my end?  Whatever i am destined to get.. i\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; will get...\n&gt;  \n&gt; One can also say in the same vein: Do I have to go to w=\r\nork to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows, success, =\r\nfailure everything about me and my family is decided by god in advance. It =\r\nis like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will happen=\r\n to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we will get. W=\r\nill my going to work or not going to work change things?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, o=\r\nne does not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard to =\r\nfind a new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened to the l=\r\nogic that &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?\n&gt;  \n&gt; We=\r\nll, from one reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But you=\r\n, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to that refe=\r\nrence frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you can=\r\n engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to thos=\r\ne actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very importa=\r\nnt and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have performed a=\r\nn action or skipped an action only because god had already decided so. But =\r\nyou do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, don&#39;t you?=\r\n In the previous example where one lost a job, won&#39;t one look for a new job=\r\n?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at ho=\r\nme and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will not look f=\r\nor a job, sit at home and yet something will happen and family will do fine=\r\n. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, but not get a job a=\r\nnd family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job=\r\n, get a job and family will do fine.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is absolutely true that which=\r\never of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead =\r\nand suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffering) and want=\r\n to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in your referenc=\r\ne frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and =\r\nintuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the desi=\r\nred outcome. However, given that you don&#39;t know what god willed and what wi=\r\nll happen, you cannot convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL happ=\r\nen. So do not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you can and be prepared =\r\nfor any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Suppose you are trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a=\r\n really heavy wind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you the=\r\nre or you can row the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you const=\r\nantly re-evaluate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that yo=\r\nu finally reach the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes =\r\nyour rowing, you cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not r=\r\now well, wind may keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may no=\r\nt reach the bank. You keep doing your best to row in the correct direction.=\r\n If wind took you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start cr=\r\nying. Then wind may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective of =\r\nthe outcome, the best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep=\r\n rowing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also =\r\nblowing harder than before and you are not making progress, do not stop row=\r\ning. If you do, you may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind do=\r\nes not blow the same way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come =\r\nwhen your rowing will be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes =\r\nyou in the correct direction. So, just row row row your boat...\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ponde=\r\nr on this metaphor a little.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The same logic=\r\n that applies to looking for a job above applies to doing homam and other s=\r\npiritual sadhana. Do they change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same wa=\r\ny looking for a job actively when you are out of one does.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Perhaps go=\r\nd has decided that one will not do sadhana and one will be stuck without an=\r\ny progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet so=\r\nmething will happen and one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided tha=\r\nt one will do sadhana, but not make much progress in the next few years or =\r\nlives. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana and make good progr=\r\ness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is absolutely true that whichever of the above god willed wil=\r\nl happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a desired o=\r\nutcome (e.g. spiritual progress) and want to maximize the chance (calculate=\r\nd based on what you know in your reference frame) that your desired outcome=\r\n happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the =\r\nbest action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. Do the best you can a=\r\nnd be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just as se=\r\narching for a job is a good strategy in general for one without a job and w=\r\nanting family not to suffer, doing spiritual sadhana such as homam and japa=\r\nm is a good strategy in general for one wanting to make spiritual progress.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I want to emphasize that spiritual progres=\r\ns does not mean giving up family and their welfare. Spiritual progress mean=\r\ns doing whatever dharma you are doing now, but doing it better - doing it w=\r\nithout attachment. Attachment to a result does not enable you to do better =\r\nactions. Constant anxiety regarding whether the desired result will happen =\r\nor not will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop one from operating at one&#39;s best.=\r\n Decide your actions based on a desired outcome, but with a complete realiz=\r\nation that the outcome may not be achieved even though your actions seem at=\r\n this point of time to be the best possible actions to maximize the chance =\r\nof that outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Such a karma yogi is always doing the best possible =\r\nactions and wasting very little time on worrying about things not in one&#39;s =\r\ncontrol. It is a very effective strategy materially as well as spiritually!=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I also would like to ask whether Spiritu=\r\nal progress requires\n&gt; &gt; sacrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures=\r\n ? Can&#39;t we have\n&gt; &gt; both?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Spiritual progress and material success ca=\r\nn co-exist. But spiritual progress and attachment to (and worrying about) m=\r\naterial success tend to pull one in different directions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not see =\r\nworld as a place where you seek pleasures or enjoyments, but see it mainly =\r\nas a place where you *give* enjoyment to others. Focus on giving. You may a=\r\nlso *receive* pleasures in the bargain, but do not strive for it or calcula=\r\nte it or focus your mind on it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; What you give now is in your hands. W=\r\nhat you get now is in god&#39;s hands and is decided based on what you gave ear=\r\nlier. What you give now decides what you will receive later. Spiritual prog=\r\nress essentially means realizing this and focusing the mind, its thoughts a=\r\nnd actions on giving to the world, rather than receiving. Even as you focus=\r\n your mind on giving, you will also receive some things. But exactly what t=\r\nhey are is based on what you gave in the past, which is water under the bri=\r\ndge, and hence you have no control over it now. This is true irrespective o=\r\nf whether you are attached to what you receive or not.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just keep doing sadhana. My feeling is that you are one of the =\r\npeople who will make very good progress in coming years. Rome is not built =\r\nin a day.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My intuition strongly tells me that Vishnu homam is the bes=\r\nt for you. If you want, you can keep doing occasional Chandi homam like you=\r\n are doing now. But why don&#39;t you consider replacing the daily Ganapathi ho=\r\nmam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra naama stotra and do homam with =\r\nit.
