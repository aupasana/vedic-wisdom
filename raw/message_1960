After all, Parasara equated them to Vishnu&#39;s 10 incarnations. Th=\r\nus, they cannot be impure. But, why do we look at some planets or some thin=\r\ngs associated with some planets as impure? I will answer in a second.\n \nThe=\r\n supreme cosmic being, who has all gunas and yet untouched by gunas and who=\r\n does all actions of all beings in this world and yet untouched by any acti=\r\non, takes on various fundamental qualities and manifests as various planets=\r\n. Thus, the innermost *essence* of each planet is basically a representatio=\r\nn of the Infinite. It is ever pure.\n \nHowever, an outer core evolves within=\r\n the framework of duality around the innermost essence of each planet. Thou=\r\ngh the finest innermost essence of the planet is ever pure, this outer core=\r\n that develops around the planet may have various qualities and part of it =\r\nmay be seen as pure or part of it as impure, within the framework of dualit=\r\ny. When people talk of planets, they are talking of the outer core and henc=\r\ne they view planets as predominantly pure or predominantly impure and vario=\r\nus things represented by a planet as pure or impure.\n \nBut remember that th=\r\ne innermost core essence is perfectly pure for each planet. You can reach t=\r\nhe infinite by reaching the finest essence of ANY planet.\n \n*        *     =\r\n   *\n \nStatements from tantra like Krishna being &quot;saakshaat&quot; (literally) Ka=\r\nalika or equating either with a planet may baffle some. However, please not=\r\ne that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who *understood by experience* the true nat=\r\nure of both Krishna and Kaali, said the same thing. He said that Krishna an=\r\nd Kaali are essentially the same. He said the difference between them is ak=\r\nin to the difference between Sun and Sun&#39;s rays.\n \nWhen Vishnu avataras (or=\r\n mahavidyas) are equated to planets, please note that we are NOT talking ab=\r\nout everything that the planet is associated with (i.e. outer core), but th=\r\ne innermost essence of the planet that is ever pure and a representation of=\r\n the Infinite. THAT essence can be viewed as a Vishnu avatara as well as a =\r\nmahavidya, with the difference between the two being quite subtle, like the=\r\n difference between Sun and Sun&#39;s rays.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; (Narasimh=\r\na) From the perspective of Venus (enjoyment), this duality needs to\n&gt; be en=\r\njoyed and not run away from. The symbolism behind Chhinnamasta depicted\n&gt; a=\r\nccompanied by a naked couple in copulation and associates drinking wine is\n=\r\n&gt; that nothing is impure and all is Brahman. That is the take of Venus\n&gt; (e=\r\nnjoyment).\n&gt; \n&gt; Correctly you have pointed out that we should not be superf=\r\nicial. To say\n&gt; that the symbolism behind the copulating couple in Chhinnam=\r\nasta&#39;s\n&gt; iconography is about enjoyment is highly superficial. You have mis=\r\nsed the\n&gt; boat here. Chhinnamasta is all about suppressing that. There have=\r\n been many\n&gt; works by renowned scholars in both east and the west on this. =\r\nThere is\n&gt; surely nothing wrong with Venus. The problem occurs when Rahu is=\r\n associated\n&gt; Venus. That&#39;s when we talk of re-directing that undesirable c=\r\narnal energy.\n&gt; Chhinnamasta represents that unleashed carnality of Rahu. V=\r\nenus on the other\n&gt; hand is the purest of them all. After all he gets exalt=\r\ned in the sign of\n&gt; maharishis. Venus has the capacity to bloom like the lo=\r\ntus from the cesspool\n&gt; like mud of life.\n \nWhether Chhinnamasta is &quot;all ab=\r\nout suppressing that&quot; or about rising above it can be discussed later, as t=\r\nhat is secondary. But, even as you dismiss the symbolism as &quot;highly superfi=\r\ncial&quot;, you ARE alluding to the symbolism when you finally say:\n \n&gt; Chhinnam=\r\nasta represents that unleashed carnality of Rahu. Venus on the other\n&gt; hand=\r\n is the purest of them all.\n \nIt is Venus who actually shows carnal pleasur=\r\nes and not Rahu. Rahu shows materialism, but carnal pleasures ARE shown by =\r\nVenus. And that does not make him impure. Let us not change the basics of a=\r\nstrology and make Rahu the karaka of sex. It is Venus. Moreover, as you poi=\r\nnted out, Chhinnamasta is also called Vajra Vairochani and is said to be lu=\r\nstrous and pure like a Vajra (diamond). Venus is the one associated with di=\r\namond.\n \nMunda maalaa tantra equates Chhinnamasta with Bhargava Rama, who i=\r\ns equated with Venus by Parasara. All the external symbolism around Chhinna=\r\nmasta (sex and other pleasures) matches the external qualities associated w=\r\nith Venus. Her internal nature described nicely by you below (yogic powers,=\r\n supreme bliss etc) also matches with Venus. Why then is suddenly Rahu brou=\r\nght into the picture? It should be Venus.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs Dattat=\r\nreya&#39;s Avadhoota Gita teaches, actions are not what bind us, it is our ego =\r\n(I-ness) identifying with (and attaching to) the actions that binds us. Whe=\r\nn performed without any attachment whatsoever, no action is &quot;impure&quot;. It is=\r\n our sense that &quot;I am doing&quot; and &quot;I am enjoying&quot; that introduces impurity. =\r\nWhen that is completely absent, one is ever pure.\n \nAs actions provoking th=\r\ne basic instincts within us are so difficult to perform without an identifi=\r\ncation, a regular sadhaka is better off staying away from certain activitie=\r\ns such as carnal pleasures. But it is *possible* to be established in Brahm=\r\nan even during such activities considered impure, as demonstrated by Dattat=\r\nreya. That is the way of Venus.\n \nThe way of Saturn is to silence the inter=\r\nnal enemies and practice austerities. But the way of Venus is not to suppre=\r\nss so-called enjoyments, but to overcome the identification even when engag=\r\ning in so-called enjoyments.\n \nAfter all, Venus is the teacher of demons. H=\r\ne is in the middle of the demons and yet remains perfectly pure being a gre=\r\nat yogi. This is a metaphor for the fact that internally Venus is *in* one&#39;=\r\ns passions and pleasures (including carnal ones) and yet he is absolutely p=\r\nure. At the outer core, Venus shows all enjoyment within one, including car=\r\nnal pleasures. These things may seem dirty, like Chhinnamasta&#39;s surrounding=\r\ns in iconography. If you go from the outer core to the innermost essence, t=\r\nhen you catch hold of true essence of Venus, which is perfectly pure. And t=\r\nhe glow of *that* blissful yogic essence is Chhinnamasta. Once you catch ho=\r\nld of the true essence of Venus (or Chhinnamasta), you are liberated.\n \nBy =\r\nperfecting various aspects of one&#39;s personality, i.e. by being one with the=\r\n innermost essence (not the outer core) of that aspect of one&#39;s personality=\r\n, one reaches the fine essence of various planets and one can become libera=\r\nted. That is the point of mahavidyas.\n \nAs I said before, all the planets a=\r\nre essentially ever pure, if you focus on their innermost essential nature =\r\nand not the outward manifestation.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; The Todala Tan=\r\ntra gives a different co-relation:\n \nThe list given by Todala tantra covers=\r\n more than 10 goddesses and more than 10 gods. So it could be for something=\r\n else. On the other hand, the list given by Munda Maalaa Tantra gives the d=\r\nasa mahavidyas and dasavataras exactly and maps them.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \n&gt; Mundamala Tantra is just one of the tantras, and not the top of the ru=\r\nng. It\n&gt; would be interesting to see what the Mahanirvan, the Gyanarnava, t=\r\nhe\n&gt; Pranatoshini, the Mahanil, the Kularnava tantras and specially the Yam=\r\nala\n&gt; texts have to say on this.\n \nIf you can quote anything interesting fr=\r\nom any tantra text, we can discuss it.\n \n&gt; I am delighted that you have at =\r\nlast succumbed to\n&gt; Devi worship. I remember 2-3 years back in Boston you r=\r\nejected all kinds of\n&gt; Devi worship including the Sri Sri Chandi.\n \nActuall=\r\ny, I have been a Mahalakshmi worshipper for more than 15 years and not real=\r\nly away from Devi. The last time we met in Boston was 6-7 years ago. A lot =\r\nhappened since then. Grace of a realized master can work wonders, even with=\r\n a fool.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYour long exposition on mahavidyas in mail=\r\n 2 quoted below has nothing we have not heard before at SJC. But, the probl=\r\nem is that it has no unfirm binding thread. You go on to say a lot of disjo=\r\nint things about a deity and suddenly one planet is tied in at the end. The=\r\nre is no flow of logic or uniform criteria used for linking planets.\n \n&gt; pr=\r\notruding tongue and so on.  Saturn is related to sins, longevity,\n&gt; re-birt=\r\nh, the lord of the tithi amavasya, when she is worshipped; the\n&gt; darkest of=\r\n nights for cleansing the darkest of sins. It is in amavsaya, that\n \nThere =\r\nare two long paragraphs on Kaali, but only the above at the end tries to ex=\r\nplain why Kaali should be shown by Saturn. Are you suggesting that only Kaa=\r\nli cleanses sins and others do not? Secondly, are other mahavidyas also wor=\r\nshipped on the tithis of their planets? After all, Ketu does not even have =\r\na tithi and he shows one mahavidya. Then what is the logic behind deducing =\r\nthe planet from the tithi in one case?\n \nUsing one parameter to map to one =\r\nplanet in one case and another parameter to map to another planet in anothe=\r\nr case is inconsistent.\n \n&gt; The Moon attains its full 16 kalas on purnima; =\r\nthe devi is then Shodashi.\n \nWhy then doesn&#39;t Moon or Saturn (ruling Purnim=\r\na) show Shodasi?\n \n&gt; Resplendent, majestic and manifest. The queen of the t=\r\nhree puras. Tri- puras\n&gt; also represent the three aspects of the Kundalini =\r\nshakti. She is the empress\n&gt; of kundalini. Very much saguna. Prithvi tattva=\r\n Mercury is associated with\n&gt; her. Sri shakti; hence linked with the most s=\r\naumya of the planets. She is\n \nWell, Mercury is NOT the most soumya of plan=\r\nets. In some charts, he can even be kroora. He simply behaves like his comp=\r\nany.\n \nIn any case, again there is no logic behind the conclusion. Why is &quot;=\r\nprithvi tattva&quot; Mercury associated with her? What about the tattvas of plan=\r\nets in other cases? Is &quot;prithvi tattva&quot; the only &quot;very much saguna&quot; thing? =\r\nIs jala tattva or vaayu tattva nirguna?\n \n&gt; It is Chhinnamasta who has the =\r\npower to cut the knots of\n&gt; Rahu and release the sadhaka from his bonds to =\r\nenable his journey towards\n&gt; Moksha.\n \nAgain, the above conclusion comes af=\r\nter a really long exposition and the conclusion has nothing to do with the =\r\nexposition. Do you mean to say that other mahavidyas cannot cut the knots o=\r\nf Rahu?\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; The Planet-Mahavidya co-relation is\n&gt; not=\r\n SJC&#39;s version. It is used by many pandits and priests.\n \nYes, I am aware t=\r\nhat it is not an SJC invention. But it does not seem to be backed by any sc=\r\nriptures and only backed by a relatively modern astrology text. Several peo=\r\nple may have been influenced by Bhattacharya&#39;s text.\n \nSarbani, you follow =\r\nSri Achyutananda. Sri Achyutananda said, according to a paper by Sanjay ji =\r\na decade ago, that a kali yuga sub-cycle within the current kali yuga ends =\r\naround 2000 AD and a satya yuga sub-cycle starts. Isn&#39;t it possible that th=\r\ne kali yuga sub-cycle corrupted some knowledge and some of it will be clean=\r\ned up in the current sub-cycle?\n \n*        *        *\n \nDear Vishnu,\n \n&gt; 1)=\r\n Can any of you provide a direct quote from any of the 64 authentic\n&gt; tantr=\r\nas that relates maha vidyas to planets?\n \nI cannot. However, I have given a=\r\n quote from an authentic tantra regarding the linking of dasavataras with d=\r\nasa mahavidyas and we are all aware of Parasara&#39;s quote equating planets wi=\r\nth dasavataras. The best I can suggest is combining the two.\n \nPlanets are =\r\nsecondary here. The key is to understand the tattva (essence) of mahavidyas=\r\n. Understand what kind of supreme liberating knowledge each mahavidya repre=\r\nsents. Though using the correct planets helps you understand the tattva bet=\r\nter, we need NOT think in terms of planets.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n \nMail 1 being r=\r\neplied to:\n \n&gt; Dear Narsimha,\n&gt; \n&gt;  (Narasimha) Friends, there may be an ou=\r\ntcry to my writings from astrologers\n&gt; used to a different planet-mahavidya=\r\n map (which is NOT sanctioned by any\n&gt; scripture and yet popular today in s=\r\nome circles). I may not be able to\n&gt; respond to all the mails.\n&gt; \n&gt; An outc=\r\nry??? Regarding what?? No, no you have got the wrong end of the stick\n&gt; her=\r\ne. The planet-mahavidya mapping is used by many priests and pundits who\n&gt; a=\r\nre in no way associated with SJC. They even have them up in their websites.=\r\n\n&gt; So please do not start an agenda of saying this is &quot;SJC&quot;&#39;s\n&gt; version/uns=\r\nanctioned etc. Let us instead have an intellectual theological\n&gt; debate, wh=\r\nich is far more interesting. YOU can say that though in practice\n&gt; most pri=\r\nests and books follow a certain norm of planet-mahavidya\n&gt; co-relation, but=\r\n on reflection a different order appeals to you and you are\n&gt; sharing that =\r\nwith us. \n&gt; \n&gt; Mundamala Tantra is just one of the tantras, and not the top=\r\n of the rung. It\n&gt; would be interesting to see what the Mahanirvan, the Gya=\r\nnarnava, the\n&gt; Pranatoshini, the Mahanil, the Kularnava tantras and special=\r\nly the Yamala\n&gt; texts have to say on this.

I remember 2-3 years back in Boston you r=\r\nejected all kinds of\n&gt; Devi worship including the Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maha=\r\nvidya is THE supreme knowledge. When you write:\n&gt; \n&gt; (Narasimha) From the p=\r\nerspective of Venus (enjoyment), this duality needs to\n&gt; be enjoyed and not=\r\n run away from. The symbolism behind Chhinnamasta depicted\n&gt; accompanied by=\r\n a naked couple in copulation and associates drinking wine is\n&gt; that nothin=\r\ng is impure and all is Brahman.

Venus has the capacity to bloom like the lotus from the =\r\ncesspool\n&gt; like mud of life. At a deeper level, this blooming of the lotus =\r\nis really\n&gt; the blooming of our soul, the awakening. That is why the Sharad=\r\natilaka\n&gt; tantra advises us to worship Kamalatmika in water as the sun rise=\r\ns. In her\n&gt; mantra she is addressed as Jagatprasutyai ...the one who gives =\r\nbirth h to\n&gt; this world.  I think you need to work a little more on this, a=\r\nnd I am sure\n&gt; Mother will show the way. There are fantastic works done on =\r\nthe mahavidyas\n&gt; by many exponents from the different gurukuls of India, th=\r\nough of course no\n&gt; one writes the really deeper level experiences which ca=\r\nn only stem from\n&gt; sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Incidentally, there are many quiet member=\r\ns in these lists who are extremely\n&gt; spiritual and any of whom have years o=\r\nf experience in devi worship. I appeal\n&gt; to them to share their experiences=\r\n with us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarbani Rath\n \nMail 2 being replied to:\n =\r\n\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sarbani Rath&quot; &lt;sarbani@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ha=\r\nre Rama Krishna\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; The Avatar-Mahavidya co-relation =\r\nis for a different purpose.

Some of them have\n&gt; it in their web sites, and they are not linked with =\r\nSJC in any way. I don=E2=80=99t\n&gt; think this is the issue here. The issue i=\r\ns to understand the different\n&gt; schemes of relations between the Avatars an=\r\nd the Mahavidyas, for which one\n&gt; needs to delve deep into the Mahavidyas a=\r\nnd understand these various\n&gt; schemes. I just wanted to share a few points =\r\nabout some of the Mahavidyas\n&gt; for deeper reflection. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sadashiva/Mahak=\r\nal lying beneath Kali is the nirguna, Purusha from whom the\n&gt; gunatmika Pra=\r\nkriti, in the form of Kali, has sprung. Kali=E2=80=99s wild dance is\n&gt; the =\r\nlila of srishti. Kali=E2=80=99s foot, touching Sadashiva, signifies the\n&gt; c=\r\nonnection between Purusha and Prakriti; that it is the same Brahma who can\n=\r\n&gt; be at once nirguna (Purusha/Sadashiva)  and saguna (Prakriti/Kali). The\n&gt;=\r\n imagery is the personification of Shivashaktiaikya or Prakritipurushaaikya=\r\n.\n&gt; The Avatar-Mahavidya connection depicts this aspect. Narayanchandra als=\r\no\n&gt; adheres to this belief. Kali holds the power to severe in one stroke, w=\r\nith\n&gt; her khagda, the bondage of the atma with the body and mind. Thakur sp=\r\neaks of\n&gt; his visit to Varanasi, where at Manikarnika, he saw clearly Kali =\r\nmoving from\n&gt; corpse to corpse, detatching the soul. Although Kali is the g=\r\nunatmika form\n&gt; of the Brahma, in the spectrum of the forms of the Divine F=\r\neminine, she is\n&gt; nirguna. She burns your sins by =E2=80=98eating=E2=80=99 =\r\nthe fruits of all your karmas,\n&gt; thereby making you ready for that bandhna =\r\nmukti. A special puja of hers is\n&gt; the Phalaharini Kali Puja, performed wit=\r\nhout fail by Thakur each year (and\n&gt; continues in the RKM Maths and Mission=\r\ns to this day); a very auspicious Kali\n&gt; Puja, where she =E2=80=98eats=E2=\r\n=80=99 all your karma phalas. The study of her imagery is\n&gt; vast; if you go=\r\n into the details about her skull garland, which represents\n&gt; the varnas- m=\r\nundamala is actually varnamala-; why her teeth is pressing her\n&gt; protruding=\r\n tongue and so on.  Saturn is related to sins, longevity,\n&gt; re-birth, the l=\r\nord of the tithi amavasya, when she is worshipped; the\n&gt; darkest of nights =\r\nfor cleansing the darkest of sins. It is in amavsaya, that\n&gt; Mahakal and Ma=\r\nhakali are united in a permanent embrace; in the aloneness of\n&gt; the deepest=\r\n of dark nights.  In tantra, amaa-kalaa is known as Prakriti. A\n&gt; Moon bere=\r\nft of any kalaas. (The other divine form who rermoves your sins\n&gt; instantly=\r\n is Krishna).\n&gt; \n&gt; To reach Kali you must cross the bhava sagar; the ocean =\r\nof karmas, the ocean\n&gt; of sansar filled with the waves of our illusory atta=\r\nchments. Tara helps us\n&gt; to cross over this sorrowful ocean, so that we can=\r\n reach Kali. Hence Tarini\n&gt; =E2=80=93 she who helps us cross the bhava saga=\r\nr. She is the shakti of Brihaspati\n&gt; and if you read the Tararahasyam you w=\r\nill see that she is worshipped with\n&gt; the vagbhava bija aim. (Although her =\r\nmula bija is the pranava). She has\n&gt; emerged from the bija Hum, by which th=\r\ne evils of the sansar are suppressed.\n&gt; Without her strength you cannot cro=\r\nss that ocean. Her various forms =E2=80=93\n&gt; Ugratara, Ekajata, Nila Sarasv=\r\nati =E2=80=93 explains further, details of the layers\n&gt; of this shakti. One=\r\n of Nila Sarasvati=E2=80=99s mantra is Aim Aim Vada Vada\n&gt; Vagvidini Svaha;=\r\n associations of Tara with the Guru, with knowledge. She\n&gt; bestows the know=\r\nledge of  crossing the ocean. \n&gt; \n&gt; The Moon attains its full 16 kalas on p=\r\nurnima; the devi is then Shodashi.\n&gt; Resplendent, majestic and manifest. Th=\r\ne queen of the three puras. Tri- puras\n&gt; also represent the three aspects o=\r\nf the Kundalini shakti. She is the empress\n&gt; of kundalini. Very much saguna=\r\n. Prithvi tattva Mercury is associated with\n&gt; her. Sri shakti; hence linked=\r\n with the most saumya of the planets. She is\n&gt; Mantratmika. Because Mercury=\r\n is related to learning; Tripurasundari is\n&gt; worshipped in all guru-shishya=\r\n paramparas. Incidentally she is worshipped on\n&gt; Thurdays. Thakur performed=\r\n the shodasa upachar puja to ma as Shodasi.\n&gt; Although Ma has said, =E2=80=\r\n=9CKnow that I am Bagala=E2=80=9D. (In the chart provided in her\n&gt; biograph=\r\ny by Swami Gambhirananda, she is Karka lagna with lagna lord and AK\n&gt; Moon =\r\nconjoined Mars).\n&gt; \n&gt; Devi Chhinnnamasta  is the thunderbolt, the streak of=\r\n lightening, which is\n&gt; the shakti of Virocana, the Supreme Self, the lumin=\r\nosity of the Primordial\n&gt; Prakasa. That is why she is Vajravairocani, the g=\r\nlow of the Paramatma which\n&gt; flashes like a lightening and shatters the ski=\r\nes. She is yellow and shines\n&gt; like a million suns, the glory of which dest=\r\nroys all desires and makes her a\n&gt; Mahayogini, the supreme exponent of yogi=\r\nc powers and like Vajra, pure and\n&gt; blazing. She epitomizes self-control by=\r\n conquering sexual and selfish\n&gt; desires and transforming that energy into =\r\nyogic energy. Hence she is\n&gt; Yogamaya, Yogamargapradayini, the acme of yogi=\r\nc force. The blood rushing\n&gt; from below her feet to her head depicts this t=\r\nransformation of kunadalini\n&gt; energy from its somnabulence to its blossomin=\r\ng through the dint of yoga and\n&gt; the act of self control. Be the energy bel=\r\now the control of sexual desire of\n&gt; Rati and Kama, or the transformation o=\r\nf the eternal yearning for Shiva under\n&gt; her feet, both are channelized int=\r\no a blazing, yogic might, which makes her\n&gt; like the Vajra, untainted and p=\r\nure. This primal energy rushes up her body to\n&gt; meet the thousand petalled =\r\nlotus in her head, culminating in the bliss of\n&gt; the union with Parama Shiv=\r\na. Hence she is the epitome of spiritual power\n&gt; which every sadhaka seeks =\r\nto acquire. The energy is also channelized into\n&gt; love as the blood nourish=\r\nes her devotees on her either side, who were hungry\n&gt; for nourishment. So s=\r\nhe is the food (bhojanam), the nourisher (bhokta) and\n&gt; the eater (bhojyam)=\r\n as she also drinks her own blood while feeding her\n&gt; devotees. These two d=\r\nevotees are Rajas and Tamas, who could not escape the\n&gt; bind of duality, an=\r\nd are therefore fed by the secondary channels or nadis,\n&gt; Ira and Pingala. =\r\nThus they are also known by these names. The Devi as the\n&gt; Sushumna, depict=\r\ns Satva guna and she is the one who is able to cut the binds\n&gt; of the chakr=\r\nas and clear the passage for the blood to rush though and unite\n&gt; with Shiv=\r\na in the sahasrara and then gush down to drench the sadhaka in the\n&gt; bliss =\r\nof the union. As the destroyer of all bonds, and the means of\n&gt; achieving l=\r\niberation through supreme yogic powers, Chhinnamasta is the\n&gt; embodiment of=\r\n Moksha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rahu, the greatest of bonders, the cause of re-birth, grips t=\r\nhe sadhaka in\n&gt; its vicious coils. From its basest form of extreme greed an=\r\nd carnal desires,\n&gt; through the treachery and trickery of its twisted mind,=\r\n it seeks to engulf\n&gt; all that comes before his path. Even when a person is=\r\n able to avoid such\n&gt; engulfment, it ensures that his path towards the unio=\r\nn with Parama Shiva is\n&gt; strewn with hurdles and makes it difficult for the=\r\n sadhaka to prise himself\n&gt; from his grasp. It is Chhinnamasta who has the =\r\npower to cut the knots of\n&gt; Rahu and release the sadhaka from his bonds to =\r\nenable his journey towards\n&gt; Moksha. Chhinnamasta therefore is the link, wh=\r\nich allows one to travel the\n&gt; trajectory from Rahu (bondage) to Ketu (libe=\r\nration), wherein all desires are\n&gt; dissolved. Having cut the bonds, Devi he=\r\nrself absorbs the poison and\n&gt; transforms herself to Dhoomavati, the widow.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarbani Rath\n \nMail 3 being replied to:\n \n=\r\n&gt; Dear Narasimha, Visti, Sarbani et al,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Could all of you=\r\n please tone down the rhetoric so that we can discuss the\n&gt; issue at hand. =\r\nI have a few basic questions and hope atleast one among you\n&gt; can answer it=\r\n/them!\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Can any of you provide a direct quote from any of the 64 aut=\r\nhentic\n&gt; tantras that relates maha vidyas to planets?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Who do tantra=\r\ns stop after mapping/relating maha vidyas to dasa avataras?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Why has=\r\nn&#39;t Parasara related grahas to maha vidyas, where as he found it\n&gt; so conve=\r\nnient to relate them to dasa avataras?\n&gt; \n&gt; warm regards,\n&gt; Vishnu\n\n\n"}}
