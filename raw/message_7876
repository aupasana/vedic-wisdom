One&#39;s experiences and actions a=\r\nre due to \n&gt; the momentum set in motion by previously present conditioning.=\r\n One \n&gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. =\r\nThus, \n&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum com=\r\nes to \n&gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi =\r\netc \n&gt; are returned to the original sources from which they were borrowed a=\r\nnd \n&gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while \n&gt; op=\r\nerating with an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and \n&gt; no=\r\nt from identification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is \n&gt; not=\r\n any better or any extra freedom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to=\r\n operate an identity after some \n&gt; time, that time depending on the strengt=\r\nh of prior momentum! It can be \n&gt; days or months or years or centuries or m=\r\nillennia.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings =\r\n(e.g. \n&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an identity f=\r\nor a \n&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off completely. It may even=\r\n be \n&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the momentum set i=\r\nn \n&gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to \n&gt; =\r\nidentify with a newly created identity (e.g. a new incarnation).

I wasn&#39;t perhaps =\r\nclear enough. Obviously, \n&gt; &gt; these are not easy ideas to communicate in va=\r\nikhari (external \n&gt; &gt; communication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbib=\r\ne something more \n&gt; &gt; than vaikhari in the following words so that people c=\r\nan understand \n&gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering your quest=\r\nions is \n&gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perhaps b=\r\nenefit \n&gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - now or in future).\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; The problem is not =\r\nidentification. The problem is *conditioning* \n&gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants,=\r\n agendas etc) that drives the identification \n&gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s aha=\r\nmkara identifies with. If ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when ch=\r\nitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, \n&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (id=\r\nentification) remains while chitta \n&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is=\r\n jeevanmukti. It is as simple as \n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; If one engages in an action with zer=\r\no conditioning, then there is no \n&gt; &gt; karma and there are no rinas created.=\r\n Actions (physical or mental) by \n&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is th=\r\ne=C2=A0 *conditioned* actions that \n&gt; &gt; bind one!

Y=\r\net, the momentum set in \n&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will cont=\r\ninue to affect the body, \n&gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s =\r\nahamkara is identifying \n&gt; &gt; with. But, because there is no conditioning an=\r\nd hence no agendas, no \n&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neither rej=\r\noices nor protests nor \n&gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what one is i=\r\ndentifying with.\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more pain in =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no \n&gt; &gt; conditi=\r\noning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking \n&gt; &gt; of prayi=\r\nng to god to reduce pain requires conditioning in chitta \n&gt; &gt; (absent in a =\r\njeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a body, one doe=\r\ns not view it \n&gt; &gt; as something his own and something that must be kept in =\r\na particular \n&gt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. =\r\nAll that \n&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what one \n&gt; &gt; identifi=\r\nes with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various \n&gt; &gt; deities (pan=\r\ncha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time \n&gt; &gt; etc) and he=\r\nnce as a manifestation of Light itself. One does not view \n&gt; &gt; it from the =\r\nprism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y \n&gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One v=\r\niews it as &quot;this is me. I am made of portions borrowed \n&gt; &gt; from various de=\r\nities, i.e. various manifestations of Light. I observe \n&gt; &gt; their play, i.e=\r\n. what they do, and I have no agenda pursue using \n&gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; This is t=\r\nhe essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as \n&gt; &gt; Mantra Pushp=\r\nam that we were discussing a while back.\n&gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is no=\r\nt the problem. It is the conditioning \n&gt; &gt; that drives how one uses what on=\r\ne identifies with, that is the \n&gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed mys=\r\nelf better, though, given how \n&gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, so=\r\nme people may still get \n&gt; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big=\r\n deal.

The question was as I a=\r\nsked it. Why did \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my question presumes,=\r\n that he got it \n&gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If his mind did not identi=\r\nfy with his \n&gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma, then the karma would not=\r\n have \n&gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no identification, so no karma (like=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body, then it is obvious that there \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind with body, that he could not \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not that he was oblivious \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta. So how can \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n that happen, if according to that definition, the mind must be \n&gt; &gt; identi=\r\nfying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt; &gt; The answer is st=\r\nraight forward.

Some portions of the Tw=\r\nitter exchange are quoted at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case=\r\n someone is interested in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following=\r\n question posed by Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question =\r\nto my mind is this: was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he =\r\nsuffer with throat \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions?=\r\n (according to your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Mani=\r\nsh \n&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; m=\r\nind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies \n&gt; &gt;&gt; w=\r\nith a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;exp=\r\nerience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning=\r\n. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped \n&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara =\r\nmerges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta =\r\nis completely wiped out and yet ahamkara \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no l=\r\nimiting notions (it is basically the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is l=\r\nimiting), then one becomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unli=\r\nke in the case of one who \n&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta c=\r\nontinues to have an I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions o=\r\nr conditioning). This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. =\r\nBut it does not say &quot;I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kep=\r\nt healthy or strong&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is =\r\nwiped out now!). On \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body=\r\n should be ignored \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now,=\r\n body keeps \n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set=\r\n in motion \n&gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned e=\r\nxperiences \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep wor=\r\nking \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and register=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw various \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; stru=\r\nggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such \n&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations=\r\n. Though one may feel and express the pain and other \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective experi=\r\nences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key po=\r\nint: Manas and buddhi are good at making \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and r=\r\national deductions, but, by themselves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. =\r\nThey neither like something nor dislike \n&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from th=\r\ne conditioning in chitta! The hallmark \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT =\r\nis absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta =\r\nis a moot question. A better \n&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a j=\r\neevanmukta get throat cancer \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if the=\r\nre are no karmas or rinas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. But, let =\r\nme sum it up briefly \n&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, k=\r\narmendiyas, manas and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as =\r\nbefore. One&#39;s I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. Bu=\r\nt neither I-ness nor \n&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta -=\r\n the repository of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no li=\r\nmiting notions. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi keep experiencin=\r\ng and doing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous momentum set =\r\nby the play \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was left in ch=\r\nitta. Body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas=\r\n are all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) in=\r\nfuses \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nused. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mi=\r\ntra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning =\r\nin chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that condition=\r\ning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still \n&gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness in=\r\nto those objects, but it sees them for what they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not hav=\r\ne false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel =\r\nnice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who may claim=\r\n to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas i=\r\nn today&#39;s world. If one wants to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti,=\r\n Yoga Vaasishtham is the best \n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi =\r\nVasishtha to Lord Rama is a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and cha=\r\nracterization of a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain=\r\n better how to do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get cl=\r\noser to being \n&gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what l=\r\niberation \n&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Va=\r\nasishtham. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectual=\r\n exercise \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may=\r\n ever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a very=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. That i=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free to \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really, fulfill=\r\ning all rnas, wait for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot;=\r\n fails in &quot;fulfilling \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r th=\r\ney called rnas? If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work =\r\nout themselves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of th=\r\ne body he or she \n&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actual=\r\nly sees the rnas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not t=\r\no you. You are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want=\r\n, Atma, etc. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never=\r\n bound. So, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If=\r\n these &quot;rnas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevan=\r\nmukta, what \n&gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thoug=\r\nht, that, it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is the origina=\r\nl problem. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise from this ident=\r\nification \n&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, when t=\r\nhe mind \n&gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u=\r\n r that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;b=\r\nody&quot; as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light & bco=\r\nmes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mi=\r\nnd, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanm=\r\nukta \n&gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? because, that person although aware of the ligh=\r\nt at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet direct=\r\ned d \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word being &quot;all=\r\n&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with light \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most \n&gt; &gt;&gt; l=\r\nikely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wit=\r\nh body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wher=\r\ne body stays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; there =\r\nanything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objects b=\r\nut seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n&gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant=\r\n coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that means u d=\r\nont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. Words \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like free, libera=\r\nted & jivanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detai=\r\nl sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concern=\r\ned, Vasishtha explained as clearly & \n&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being c=\r\nan ever hope 2. Manish: The question \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakris=\r\nhna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he \n&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he =\r\nwas not identifying with his actions? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretati=\r\non of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a sing=\r\nle definition. His entire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanm=\r\nukta! Will answer ur RK qn \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=C2=A0 &lt;http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n|| Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih |=\r\n|\nYahoo!

One&#39;s experiences =\r\nand actions are due to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the momentum set in motion by previously pr=\r\nesent conditioning. One &lt;BR&gt;&gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, di=\r\nslikes, and attachments. Thus, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous=\r\n identity till the momentum comes to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a screeching halt and then th=\r\ne body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are returned to the origi=\r\nnal sources from which they were borrowed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; made sentient. But a=\r\n jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while &lt;BR&gt;&gt; operating with an iden=\r\ntity, for binding comes from the\n conditioning and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not from identi=\r\nfication or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not any be=\r\ntter or any extra freedom.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceas=\r\nes to operate an identity after some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time, that time depending on =\r\nthe strength of prior momentum! It can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; days or months or years =\r\nor centuries or millennia.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nature sets such powerful momen=\r\ntum in place for some beings (e.g. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) =\r\nthat they may operate an identity for a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; very long time after condi=\r\ntioning drops off completely. It may even be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for the entire durati=\r\non of Creation. As a part of the momentum set in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; motion previously=\r\n, one may even direct a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; identify with a =\r\nnewly created identity (e.g. a new incarnation).

I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously, &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; these are not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (external &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; communication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something =\r\nmore &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; than vaikhari in the following words so that people can =\r\nunderstand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering your=\r\n questions is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge to\n YOU, =\r\nbut to perhaps benefit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - now or =\r\nin future).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=\r\n &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is not identification. The problem is *c=\r\nonditioning* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drive=\r\ns the identification &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifie=\r\ns with. If ahamkara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta (=\r\nconditioning) is cleaned up, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara =\r\n(identification) remains while chitta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is clean=\r\ned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n If one engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; karma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental)=\r\n by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the&nbsp;\n *conditione=\r\nd* actions that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires,=\r\n agendas etc (i.e. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an action t=\r\nhat bind one!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbs=\r\np; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but clos=\r\ne) identified with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS dr=\r\niven by some conditioning, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik =\r\nthat conditioning may be (!), then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that sets in motion the la=\r\nw of kaarmik action-reaction which will in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; due time give a pa=\r\nrticular reaction to what one identified with when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; engaging i=\r\nn that action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, all th=\r\ne conditioning may be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta=\r\n. Yet, the momentum set in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmuk=\r\nta will continue to affect the body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n senses and sensory mind=\r\n, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with. But, beca=\r\nuse there is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; desires=\r\n, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; tries to modify the happenings to what one is identifying with.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more pain in=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thi=\r\nnking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning =\r\nin chitta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though a j=\r\neevanmukta is identifying with a body, one does not view it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a=\r\ns something his own and something that must\n be kept in a particular &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. All that &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chitta, which is absent now!&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what one &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Var=\r\nuna, Time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. =\r\nOne does not view &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to=\r\n use it to pursue X or Y &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me=\r\n. I am made of portions borrowed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. v=\r\narious manifestations of Light. I observe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their play, i.e. wh=\r\nat they do, and I have no agenda pursue using &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; them.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we\n were discussing a while back.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; I repeat, identification is not the problem. It is the conditioning &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; that drives how one uses what one identifies with, that is the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; problem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbs=\r\np; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself bet=\r\nter, though, given how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, =\r\nsome people may still get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry=\r\n. Not a big deal. Just keep doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the mos=\r\nt important thing!). I am grateful to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vas=\r\nishtha for giving me this opportunity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishn=\r\na really got throat cancer because of his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Triling=\r\na Swami or because he took the kaarmik power of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attorney from=\r\n Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; debated=\r\n. Strictly speaking,\n whether Ramakrishna really became a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; jee=\r\nvanmukta in that lifetime or not can also be debated. But those are &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; not really useful debates.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Happy MahaShivaRatri again!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Krishnarpanamastu, Narasimha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------&nbsp; &nbsp; Free &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatif=\r\nilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spirituali=\r\nty: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jyotish writings: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Twitter ID=\r\n: @homam108 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 2:20 AM, Manish Pandit wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jai Shree Rama Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That was not the=\r\n question.\n The question was as I asked it. Why did &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrish=\r\nna get the affliction (my question presumes, that he got it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a=\r\ns a result of that insult) If his mind did not identify with his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma, then the karma would not have &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no identification, so no karma (like &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body, then it is obvious that th=\r\nere &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind with body, that he=\r\n could not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not t=\r\nhat he was oblivious &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he wa=\r\ns a Jeevanmukta. So how can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that=\r\n definition, the mind must be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to b=\r\ne qualified as a Jeevanmukta?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward. =\r\nI await your reply.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kindest regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On Sunday,\n F=\r\nebruary 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@ &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:=\r\nparent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Na=\r\nmaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want to answer a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange between my guru Manish and me=\r\n on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter exchange =\r\nare quoted at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case so=\r\nmeone is interested in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the =\r\nfollowing question posed by Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understand=\r\ning: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (according to your &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp;\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeev=\r\nanmukti. Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchang=\r\ne that rinas are of body and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to f=\r\nulfil those rinas. But body is an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It h=\r\nas no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mi=\r\nnd that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; min=\r\nd - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifi=\r\nes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and mak=\r\nes the body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance w=\r\nith those &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chit=\r\nta is completely wiped &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, t=\r\nhen it is mukti. But, if the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in\n chitta is c=\r\nompletely wiped out and yet ahamkara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist w=\r\nith no limiting notions (it is basically the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning=\r\n in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukt=\r\na (liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions or conditioning). Th=\r\nis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But it =\r\ndoes not say &quot;I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should b=\r\ne kept healthy or strong&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in =\r\nchitta, which is wiped out now!). On &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it d=\r\noes not either say &quot;this body should be ignored &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and destr=\r\noyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; expe=\r\nriencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in\n motion &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experience=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while aft=\r\ner the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and in=\r\ndriyas keep working &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat=\r\n cancer, indriyas may sense &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mi=\r\nnd) may process that input and register &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may =\r\nanalyze various observations and draw various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions=\r\n (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should =\r\novercome &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various thi=\r\nngs to do and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned be=\r\ning has no such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations.\n Though one may feel and =\r\nexpress the pain and other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one rea=\r\ncts to it differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point=\r\n: Manas and buddhi are good at making &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observati=\r\nons and rational deductions, but, by themselves, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they do =\r\nnot have ANY agenda. They neither like something nor dislike &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&n=\r\nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n * &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot questi=\r\non. A better &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeeva=\r\nnmukta get throat cancer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possibl=\r\ne if there are no karmas or rinas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n left? I have already a=\r\nnswered it. But, let me sum it up briefly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, va=\r\nrious body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bu=\r\nddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness n=\r\nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the r=\r\nepository of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are=\r\n no limiting notions. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas &amp; b=\r\nuddhi keep experiencing and doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) b=\r\nased on the previous momentum set by the play &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and=\r\n karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by\n projecting awareness into them. =\r\nThe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these a=\r\nre viewed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ a=\r\ns a portion of Indra or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and=\r\n so sense organ&quot;, due to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is =\r\nwhat creates karmas and rinas. When &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is =\r\n*completely* overcome, ahamkara can still &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; project awarene=\r\nss into those objects, but it sees them for what they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are=\r\n. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&=\r\nnbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmu=\r\nktas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one=\r\n wants to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; understand\n the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaas=\r\nishtham is the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharsh=\r\ni Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate defi=\r\nnition and characterization of a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may b=\r\ne other books that explain better how to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadha=\r\nnas to progress spiritually and get closer to being &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; liber=\r\nated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectual =\r\nexercise &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as =\r\nnone of may ever &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of cauti=\r\non: I write with a very &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong=\r\n conviction in what I write. That is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; how I am.
