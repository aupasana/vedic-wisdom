Yes. One can do homam as many times as one wants. It will give faster \nresults if one maintains the same devotion and focus.\n\nIn general, if one has free time, it is better spent in activities that make \none focus the mind on god (to the extent one is capable of) rather than in \nactivities that make one focus the mind on impermanent things.\n\n2. Do not worry about continuity. Forget a break of 7 days. Even if one does \na sadhana in one life, leaves earth and is reborn after 700 years and \ncontinues the sadhana, there WILL be continuity. One may or may not perceive \nthe continuity, but it will be there.\n\nDo not worry about continuity and keep doing whenever you can. No effort is \nwasted.\n\n3. It is fine to take the yantra with you and pray. But you should follow \nthe opinion of the person who energized it for you, instead of my opinion.\n\nYes, it can be used in homam. You can put it next to homa kundam and invoke \nthe deity in it. If one is ok with a yantra getting disfigured, one can even \nput in *inside* the homa kundam on the base of the homa kundam and leave it \nthere.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metllapalli@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, October 06, 2009 3:39 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] homam questions....\n\n\n&gt; Respected Sir,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a few more questions if you can please help me with this.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Can homam be done two times a day? Will that give faster results?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Presently I am doing homam on a daily basis. Due to woman issues every \n&gt; month I get a break of 7 days after which when I start the homam I feel \n&gt; the continuity is lost. I feel I have to start fresh. I have seen you \n&gt; mention in the forums that homam should be done on a weekly or daily \n&gt; basis. Do you think I will still get the benefit with breaks in between ? \n&gt; Is there anyway I can keep the continuity going?\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. I have an energised mahalakshmi yantra which I pray on a regular basis. \n&gt; How should I care for it when I go on a vacation? Shall I carry it with me \n&gt; whereever I go so that its not neglected? Also can I use it in homam?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sudha\n\n\n"}}
