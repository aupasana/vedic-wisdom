Some of them are meaningful =\r\nto an extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millenni=\r\na by intellectuals.\n\nHowever, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for t=\r\nhe pleasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.\n\nTh=\r\nere are some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam eve=\r\nryday as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these techn=\r\nicalities.\n\n* * *\n\nIf Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to h=\r\neavens (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on =\r\nearth. You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow =\r\nof signals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all t=\r\nimes. Even during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainl=\r\ny capable of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and mak=\r\ning them reach various deities.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want to get your father (or =\r\nmother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may =\r\nwant to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not =\r\ntired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course,=\r\n even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your =\r\nfather may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agen=\r\ndas and only want to tell your father &quot;I love you&quot; and take whatever he giv=\r\nes, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favore=\r\nd by parents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to gi=\r\nve.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are se=\r\nveral technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you =\r\nmay not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many co=\r\nrruptions in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of getting=\r\n specific material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best appr=\r\noach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express your=\r\n love and surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad. =\r\nSuch a person will be favored by deities over the long run.\n\n* * *\n\nNamaste=\r\n Ramakishore,\n\nDifferent points of space and different points of time have =\r\na different quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana i=\r\nn Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same=\r\n as sadhana on Pournima.\n\nIf one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (=\r\ne.g. a monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly =\r\nKrishna homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned wit=\r\nh the energy of that deity.\n\nHowever, one can only make so much progress wi=\r\nth occasional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, mo=\r\nre intense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/=\r\ndeity, one can do it every day and at all times.\n\n* * *\n\nA lot of beggars m=\r\nay be standing at the gate of a king&#39;s palace, waiting for the king to see =\r\nthem when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king m=\r\nay be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so =\r\nand so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gate=\r\n on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many b=\r\neggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the o=\r\nther hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king&#39;s eyes may fall o=\r\nn you someday!\n\nHave the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, keep=\r\n doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity&#39;s grac=\r\ne. That is a sureshot formula for success.\n\n* * *\n\nThe issue of auspicious =\r\ndays and times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more =\r\nauspicious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For example=\r\n, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to g=\r\no there and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, Ga=\r\nmbhir and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you ma=\r\ny still get out cheaply.\n\nInstead of helping, sadhana done on a particularl=\r\ny good day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I re=\r\nmember one incident.\n\nA few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wa=\r\nnted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for th=\r\ne whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anything=\r\n like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it=\r\n to Manish and he said, &quot;excellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated with Gayatri man=\r\ntra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks=\r\n and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. =\r\nWhen I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.\n\nNext morning, I reali=\r\nzed that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birt=\r\nhday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said tha=\r\nt spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective t=\r\nhan a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to=\r\n be an auspicious day.\n\nI mentioned it to Manish. He said, &quot;I knew it was A=\r\nkshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me&quot;. I asked him wh=\r\ny he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;knowing you were do=\r\ning this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have in=\r\nstead distracted you.&quot;\n\nHe was right. As such, I was a little &quot;proud&quot; of th=\r\ne sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement =\r\nand expectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted =\r\nmy focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadha=\r\nna is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of usele=\r\nss excitement would&#39;ve been higher and distracted me even more!\n\nBottomline=\r\n: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of yo=\r\nur mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excitem=\r\nent and expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and pa=\r\ntiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more fool=\r\nproof strategy.

I re=\r\nmember one incident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A few years ago, I decided oneday in spring tha=\r\nt I wanted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra =\r\nfor the whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at an=\r\nything like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentio=\r\nned it to Manish and he said, &quot;excellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated with Gayat=\r\nri mantra from 5 am till\n 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute=\r\n breaks and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of th=\r\ne day. When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Next mor=\r\nning, I realized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla =\r\nTritiya, birthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). I=\r\nt is said that spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times mor=\r\ne effective than a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at rando=\r\nm happened to be an auspicious day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I mentioned it to Manish. He sai=\r\nd, &quot;I knew it was Akshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to =\r\nme&quot;. I asked him why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;=\r\nknowing you were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helpe=\r\nd and would have instead distracted you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was right. As such, I w=\r\nas a little &quot;proud&quot; of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There=\r\n was a bit of\n excitement and expectancy that was present as an undercurren=\r\nt and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was do=\r\ning it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, =\r\nthat undercurrent of useless excitement would&#39;ve been higher and distracted=\r\n me even more!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what r=\r\neally matters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an a=\r\nuspicious day can create excitement and expectancy and distract one. Doing =\r\nthe same sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is=\r\n perhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy.
