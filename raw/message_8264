All the things you loved, all the things you c=\r\nlaimed to be yours, I take them and tear everything apart. I burn your IIIT=\r\n degree in front of you, and leave no trace of your very claim to be from I=\r\nIIT.\n\nI take your real estate papers and feed it to the dogs.\n\nAnd then let=\r\ns say I take your arm in my hand , and cut it off. And then I take the othe=\r\nr and I cut it off. Then I take the blood that is pouring out and Drink it,=\r\n while you are still alive. And then I grab the back of your head and slash=\r\n it off. \n\nAnd this all happens on one fine Sunday morning without warning.=\r\n\n\nMr. Tripathi, I abolish all that is &quot;Gaurav Tripathi&quot; in your life, and m=\r\nake you realize who you truly are and merge your tiny blob of light into th=\r\ne infinite light that is me, and I&#39;ll do it in the manner described above, =\r\nare you willing to love me??\nAre you willing to call me in your home??\nAre =\r\nyou willing to wash my feet and drink the water??\n\nYour eyes perceive that =\r\nI have slashed your arms off, but in reality I have taken your karmas off, =\r\nisn&#39;t that the best thing?\n\nYour eyes perceive that I have destroyed everyt=\r\nhing that you ever had, but what did you bring in the world when you were b=\r\norn?? Thus, by apparently destroying what you claim to be yours, haven&#39;t I =\r\nbroken an illusion of yours??\n\nYour eyes perceive your death, but in realit=\r\ny i am just taking my baby back whom i love.\n\nThe more attached you are to =\r\nthe false notion of &quot;you&quot;, the more fierce she appears. But if after doing =\r\nstrenuous penance, you realize that &quot;oh my gawd, all my life I have been id=\r\nentifying with this and that, and that and this.&quot;, then she will appear to =\r\nbe the most loveliest being out there. Easy to type and easy to read, diffi=\r\ncult to be at this stage.\n\nWho says you are to fear your own mother? If you=\r\n truly surrender to your mother then she can do anything with your existenc=\r\ne, right? After all she is your mother. \n\nThis is why they say be careful w=\r\nhile saying I surrender and do anything god but I only want you. Be prepare=\r\nd then to do &quot;anything&quot;.\n\nAnyways keep on doing penance, its the only purpo=\r\nse of this birth.\n\nJai girnari!!!\n\nWarm Regards,\nNobody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, gaurav tripathi &lt;gaurav_alld@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear=\r\n PVR =C2=A0Sir,\n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0Thank =C2=A0you for =C2=A0clearing my =C2=A0=\r\ndoubts.=C2=A0After=C2=A0 reading your explanation some more =C2=A0questions=\r\n have =C2=A0=C2=A0erupted\n&gt; in =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 mind.

One may accept w=\r\nhatever material results god gives, but be prepared for any results and tak=\r\ne what god gives as mahaprasad. Sure, some people have gotten great materia=\r\nl results from homam, but there are no guarantees.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If you have a=\r\n dharmik material result in mind (e.g. marriage, childbirth, getting a job =\r\netc), it is ok to think of it, but do not get into the frame of mind that h=\r\nomam will solve your problem. Use homam as a way to reach god and then let =\r\ngod decide what is right for you. Accept that what you currently want may o=\r\nr may not be the best for you.

Her slaying of Mahisha, Nishu=\r\nmbha, Shumbha etc symbolize slaying one&#39;s pride (over one&#39;s achievements), =\r\none&#39;s mamata or mine-ness (looking at things, including body, as &quot;mine&quot;), o=\r\nne&#39;s asmita or I-am-ness (the very notion that one exists as a being separa=\r\nte from Brahman) etc. As anyone trying to overcome those will know, it is n=\r\not an easy task at all. Chandi represents a very fierce approach to it, whi=\r\nch simply destroys those (and puts one in samadhi!). In sadhana and rituals=\r\n, we use symbols and eventually external symbols resonate with internal hap=\r\npenings.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; For most people, Chandi is too fierce. Though phalasrut=\r\ni entices with all kinds of nice results (which is the case with most praye=\r\nrs in Hinduism!), please note that Chandi is not for everyone.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; E=\r\nspecially so with Chandi homam. Fire amplifies things and the energy of the=\r\n prayer resonates in the internal fire faster. I humbly suggest that people=\r\n should not rush into Chandi homam. Not that it produces bad results. It ma=\r\ny produce supreme results, but you may not be looking for those or be ready=\r\n for them!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is better to do Chandipath for a few weeks or mont=\r\nhs, before trying Chandi homam.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Also,=\r\n don&#39;t think that Chandi homam is the only homam for fast progress. Most hi=\r\ngher deities (Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Lakshmi, Hanuman etc) are capable of =\r\ngiving all material and spiritual results one may imagine.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If yo=\r\nu can find a deity whose homam generates love and feeling inside your heart=\r\n, THAT homam is the right homam for you.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In fact, even Ganapathi=\r\n homam is capable of giving everything. Because we worship Ganapathi in the=\r\n beginning of every homam, people look at Ganapathi homam as an &quot;appetizer&quot;=\r\n and Chandi homam etc as the &quot;full meal&quot;. That&#39;s not correct. Even Ganapath=\r\ni homam can be a &quot;full meal&quot;. What makes a homam complete is the love, surr=\r\nender and feeling for the deity in your heart.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; On Mon, May 7, 2012 at 2:10 PM, gaurav tripath=\r\ni wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 Dear=C2=A0 All , \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Namste..!=\r\n!!=C2=A0 After=C2=A0 a long=C2=A0 thinking i=C2=A0 decided=C2=A0 to=C2=A0 d=\r\no=C2=A0 the=C2=A0 Chandi=C2=A0 Homam.
