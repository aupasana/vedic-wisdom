But please do not be has=\r\nty to judgement. The genuineness of the video has not been proven. In the p=\r\nast Kanchi Paramcharya was targetted the same way by christian missionary g=\r\nroups because he was doing exemplary work in integrating many of the downtr=\r\nodden sections . I distincly remember Narasimha ji&#39;s message of asking peop=\r\nle to maintain restraint.\n\nThe video could very well be a doctored video wi=\r\nth 64 bit processing and multicore processors it is not hard in 2010 to gen=\r\nerate a doctored video and this has been done in the past by a group lead b=\r\ny a missionary in tamilnadu called Lenis Karuppan. The Times of India artic=\r\nle has more information.\n\nScandals have erupted in the past also for many n=\r\notable gurus.I do not wish to name them all since it serves no purpose exce=\r\npt to hurt the feelings of the followers who might have learnt some nice th=\r\nings from their teachings even though they themselves might not have follow=\r\ned it.\n\nThe messenger might be imperfect ..and by judging them we will incu=\r\nrr the karma of the judgement as well.\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Its funny=C2=A0I learned the techniqu=\r\ne to control sex after hearing his discourse in youtube. Although I never l=\r\nooked upon him as a spiritual guru. As in one of his videos I saw him talki=\r\nng rudely to the helpers in tamil.=C2=A0So this scandal doesn&#39;t surprise me=\r\n. Like Shri Narsimha ji says many people preach great things but few follow=\r\n them.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; PRM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________=\r\n__\n&gt; From: krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: Wed, March 3, 2010 2:39:44 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Sex scandals=\r\n by spiritual gurus\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri narasimha Garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; For the l=\r\nast few days there are so many Sex scandals by the so called (famous and in=\r\nfamous) spiritual Guru&#39;s like Nithyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan etc etc are =\r\nbeing exposed to the masses. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any relationship with these inc=\r\nidents with the establishment of the Dharma as you keep saying in the upcom=\r\ning years?
