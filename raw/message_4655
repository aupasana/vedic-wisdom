V. NARASIMHA SWAMI wrote the first detailed English biography of the\nMa=\r\nharshi in 1931, and Suddhananda Bharati wrote the Tamil biography. Ramana\nL=\r\neela. The Telugu Biography written by Oruganti Krishnayya has the\ndistincti=\r\non of being corrected twice by the Maharshi prior to it being\nreprinted. It=\r\n is not only the most objectively-correct biography, it is also\nthe most ex=\r\ntensive.\n\nDr. Lingeswara Rao of Andhra Pradesh, carefully read through Rama=\r\nna Leela\nand noted down passages not found in English publications. Below, =\r\nwe\nreproduce some of his English translations.\n\nThe Maharshi&#39;s Father&#39;s eld=\r\ner brother, Venkateswaram Ayyar, renounced at the\nage of eighteen. He lived=\r\n at the Chidambaram Temple and worked clearing the\npremises of thorns, etc.=\r\n\n\nAt birth, Bhagavan was given the name Venkateswaram Ayyar, which\ncorrespo=\r\nnded with the name of their family deity, Sri Venkateswara of\nTirumala. Lat=\r\ner, when he registered for school, the name was changed to\nVenkataraman.\n\nB=\r\nhagavan was called Ramana, or sometimes even Ramani by an elderly relative\n=\r\nnamed Lakshaman Ayyar, who was well-versed in Telugu. Bhagavan, as a boy,\nl=\r\nearned some Telugu and would converse with this relative in that language.\n=\r\nConsequently, he began to call his father Nayana, the Telugu equivalent for=\r\n\n&#39;Daddy&#39;.\n\nThe young Venkataraman and his brother Nagaswami were sent to th=\r\neir Uncle&#39;s\nhome in Dindigul so they could receive an education in English.=\r\n When their\nUncle was transferred to Madurai the two boys followed.\n\nWhen B=\r\nhagavan first arrived at the Arunachala Temple in Tiruvannamalai in\n1896 it=\r\n was 6 a.m. The Temple was then being renovated and was not open to\nvisitor=\r\ns until 8 a.m. But when Bhagavan arrived all the doors were open and\nhe wal=\r\nked straight to the inner sanctum without seeing anyone.\n\nBhagavan was init=\r\nially called Brahmana Paradesi. Mendicant sadhus were then\nnormally called =\r\nParadesis. When he was carried from the Patala Lingam to the\nSubrahmanya Te=\r\nmple and was under the care of Mouna Swami, his greatness was\nthen realized=\r\n. Then his name was changed to Brahmana Swami.\n\nNelliapa Ayyar (Bhagavan&#39;s =\r\nUncle) failed to persuade Bhagavan to return to\nMadurai. One Narayana Swami=\r\n Ayyar [Sri P. V. Somasundaram&#39;s Father], who\naccompanied Nelliapa Ayyar, b=\r\necame annoyed and approached the young Swami\nwith the intention of taking h=\r\nim by force. Suddenly he felt a burning\nsensation all over his body and, be=\r\ncause of it, gave up the idea.\n\nOne night in the year 1934 someone asked Bh=\r\nagavan: &quot;Do you have dreams?&quot;\n\nBhagavan: &quot;Doesn&#39;t one dream in sleep?&quot;\n\nQue=\r\nstioner: &quot;Did you ever have seminal discharges during sleep, or in\ndreams.&quot;=\r\n\n\nEveryone present felt disgusted at the question, but Bhagavan without the=\r\n\nslightest sign of annoyance, calmly replied: &quot;Yes. What of that ? It may\nh=\r\nappen even if one eats hot foods. How does it matter? You are thinking I am=\r\n\nthis body. Hence the wrong understanding that if one loses the essential\nf=\r\nluid of the body, one shall fall from brahmacharya and tapas. It occurs to\n=\r\nme that I am living simultaneously in twenty different worlds with diverse\n=\r\nbodies. How can I worry over such losses or biological changes in all these=\r\n\nbody parts. The essence is not the body and its various metamorphosis but\n=\r\nAtma Gnana Nishta, the abidance in Self-Knowledge.
