Shiva and Vishnu had uncon=\r\nditional love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human b=\r\neings and their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed =\r\nby petty notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavi=\r\nte distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, =\r\nI am willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is=\r\n ok as long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available pa=\r\nths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mount=\r\nain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to =\r\nthe top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in =\r\none&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, there may be many =\r\npaths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of =\r\nthe mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not think =\r\nmuch of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that does no=\r\n harm.\n&gt; \n&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the ot=\r\nher paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one =\r\nis very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there. Wh=\r\nen one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-reali=\r\nzation, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, differe=\r\nnt paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One pa=\r\nth may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling ro=\r\ncks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the=\r\n top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if they are com=\r\nmitted to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let people fo=\r\nllow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in t=\r\nheir own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path. It =\r\ndoes not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path =\r\nand reach the top!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that some people are doin=\r\ng no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on=\r\n other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base of t=\r\nhe mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enroll th=\r\nem in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay a=\r\nt the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, p=\r\neople with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They =\r\nare on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishn=\r\na bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their ma=\r\nntra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventu=\r\nally make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even w=\r\norship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at th=\r\ne start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone,=\r\n try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep t=\r\nheir austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will e=\r\nventually make progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us not worry about people who are doing s=\r\nome sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will b=\r\ne addressed in due course.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhan=\r\na to burn the conditioning and keep making progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your views bu=\r\nt for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mis=\r\nsion to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri P=\r\nrabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shr=\r\ni Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mine=\r\n are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views lik=\r\ne me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard s=\r\ntuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that =\r\nwell known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vai=\r\nshnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of=\r\n Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

You may like some an=\r\nd dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like. =\r\nIf you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books th=\r\nat seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without even =\r\nknowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam N=\r\new York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremen=\r\ndous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attracted to h=\r\nis interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I als=\r\no like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada&#39;s comm=\r\nentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain samskaras.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to =\r\neveryone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic =\r\nbelief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divi=\r\nnity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palat=\r\nable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly=\r\n differently, because there are different groups of people with different s=\r\namkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My philosophy is simple.

If a priest is conducti=\r\nng the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the =\r\nold days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle=\r\n such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They are quit=\r\ne vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brah=\r\nmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient =\r\nfor one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions =\r\nhave to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence=\r\n over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of know=\r\nledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are ver=\r\ny very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals ca=\r\nn be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desi=\r\nrous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals fo=\r\nr others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when=\r\n you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana l=\r\nifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly b=\r\necome a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatr=\r\niyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 =\r\nbelow on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and =\r\nthere is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here=\r\n too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am do=\r\ning this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving =\r\nadvice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik c=\r\nrossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly=\r\n an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, the=\r\nn one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and =\r\nsome sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s =\r\nkarmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? W=\r\nell, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle desc=\r\nribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahm=\r\nana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.=\r\n Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahm=\r\nana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karm=\r\nas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again=\r\n, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahman=\r\nas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at=\r\n the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught=\r\n Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Sof=\r\ntware, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wro=\r\nte: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Br=\r\nahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakand=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nthink this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am p=\r\nosting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 trainin=\r\ng sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHowever in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and c=\r\nlose uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (as=\r\ntrologer) and yrou family.

Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love an=\r\nd devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and their =\r\nrelationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty notions=\r\n of superiority and dependence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite d=\r\nistinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am=\r\n willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok =\r\nas long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one=\r\n of the available paths. Whether one acknowledges\n that several mountain pa=\r\nths lead to the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path one=\r\n has chosen leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is clim=\r\nbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; After all, there may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable t=\r\no see paths on the other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the =\r\nsame side. If one does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbin=\r\ng in one&#39;s own path, that does no harm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As one reaches the=\r\n top, it gets narrower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite di=\r\nstant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one =\r\nwill see that all paths are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees=\r\n all paths to converge there. After god-realization, one sees various paths=\r\n to be valid paths to god. Of course, different paths come with different o=\r\nbstacles. One path may have some snow. One\n path may be too steep. One path=\r\n may be slippery. One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen=\r\n trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can re=\r\nach there using several paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obst=\r\nacles and reaching the top.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let people follow the paths ch=\r\nosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in their own paths. L=\r\net them say whatever they want to say about your path. It does not matter. =\r\nIf YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path and reach the top=\r\n!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The problem is that some people a=\r\nre doing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgm=\r\nents on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the ba=\r\nse of the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to en=\r\nroll them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They=\r\n stay at the base forever and never\n reach the top. They are a problem.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and make pr=\r\nogress are ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach god. For exa=\r\nmple, so many Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod m=\r\nay be doing their mantra several malas a day with a good level of devotion =\r\nand they will eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampraday=\r\nas who do not even worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worsh=\r\nip Vishvaksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they d=\r\no no harm to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to =\r\nserve all and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing som=\r\ne sadhana and will eventually make progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let us not wo=\r\nrry about people who are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficienci=\r\nes in their understanding will be addressed in due course.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The bottomline is: Keep\n doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and=\r\n keep making progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree wit=\r\nh your views but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhup=\r\nada and his mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After=\r\n exit of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very bia=\r\nsed towards Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and thos=\r\ne views of mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share=\r\n same views like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites =\r\nspeaking hard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna)=\r\n,not even that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate pro=\r\ncedures for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s =\r\nname instead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

I will reply to them together.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one th=\r\ning and doing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a=\r\n dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to =\r\nsomeone else&#39;s dirty\n place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactiv=\r\ne waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previou=\r\ns karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after a=\r\nnother and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. W=\r\nhen one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away so=\r\nme bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than ot=\r\nherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If=\r\n a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did in=\r\ntense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many pries=\r\nts of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they sta=\r\nrt messing with other people&#39;s karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not real=\r\nly brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor suff=\r\nicient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and a=\r\nctions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and in=\r\nfluence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just =\r\nof knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there =\r\nare very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rit=\r\nuals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that o=\r\nne desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rit=\r\nuals for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the=\r\nre any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well=\r\n, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you =\r\nare not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifest=\r\nyle\n described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly becom=\r\ne a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas=\r\n and vaisyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologer=\r\ns:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature c=\r\nomment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above a=\r\npplies here too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every actio=\r\nn performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal react=\r\nion. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that=\r\n person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z inste=\r\nad of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer=\r\n has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the f=\r\nruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come\n too.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s kar=\r\nmas is always a risky business.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; What is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follo=\r\nw a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and asp=\r\nire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudr=\r\nas, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought =\r\nup, one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qual=\r\nified to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or b=\r\ny conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas =\r\nby birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid=\r\n about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best\n regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D=\r\n_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that=\r\n make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow t=\r\narget=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMail 1:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &=\r\nlt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brah=\r\nmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I =\r\nam asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas speci=\r\nally those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss th=\r\nis subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/=\r\ncompose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasim=\r\nhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous =\r\ninstances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that ast=\r\nrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou f=\r\namily.
