wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranam Guruji,\n&gt;=\r\n and to all my seniors,\n&gt; \n&gt; i just want to share few of my experiences tha=\r\nt i am undergoing and wish to share it with all of my respected fellow frie=\r\nnds in here.. i with three other friends of mine have visited Venaras (kash=\r\ni) during the last week of January 2010. we visited the Manikarnika shamsha=\r\nn and all possible temples that we had planned to visit.. just before going=\r\n there i had a set frame of mind=A0 that when i will come back to home .. i=\r\nn Kolkata (Calcutta) i&#39;ll be starting Maha Ganapati=A0 homam.. atleast in t=\r\nhe weekends if not .. regularly as i was having a very bad situation both f=\r\ninancially and in the home front as well .. i brought a Baneshwar from ther=\r\ne as well. while coming back to home i was severely ill and was having Feve=\r\nr with stomach upset as well... i didnt bother much about my health as i ha=\r\nd a feeling may be its coz of the past bad karmas i am facing it ..since i =\r\nhave been lucky enough in getting guidance from two of Manish ji&#39;s direct d=\r\nisciples.. my friend who\n&gt;  have been doing Ganapati homam for quite a long=\r\n time and now he is doing Chandi homam.. showed me how to do it ,,and there=\r\n again i met another friend of mine who is regular in doing Chandi homams w=\r\nho inspired me to start as well... i was very tensed to start off as i didn=\r\nt had even that much of money to start off regularly.. and there again i wa=\r\ns a bit tensed about how my parents would react to the things like .. i am =\r\nturning out to be a veg and will be doing homams on a regular basis.. where=\r\n as my income was nil at that time .. !!\n&gt; \n&gt; now comes the suprises as fol=\r\nlows:-\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Manish ji=A0 called up my friend who was staying in my home =\r\n,who was staying in my home .. after we had returned .. from Venaras..\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 2) I was so happy and excited about the fact that without even knowing .. =\r\nhow .. i just took the decision .. that i am going to start ..my Homams DAI=\r\nLY.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) To my=A0 very surprise.. my parents did not objected, to my dec=\r\nision of doing Homams on a regular basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The very 1st day i did my=\r\n homam.. i got a call for regular work.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) By profession i am an Actor=\r\n / Anchor .. so i dont have any permanent salaried job..it implies of a inc=\r\nonsistent income .. now .. i get calls for a lot works regularly .. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6=\r\n) My mom started to recite Chandi ..path regularly and the biggest of all s=\r\nuprises.. my Dad who never was so much into spirituality is starting Saptas=\r\nhloki Chandi path .,,\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) In total.. i got very fast results ..of my ho=\r\nmams..and was lucky and blessed enough to help two others to start Ganapati=\r\n homams regularly ..all the problems that i have been facing for a long tim=\r\ne .. does not exists right now .. at all... \n&gt; \n&gt; Right now .. i am prepari=\r\nng . for Chandi homam.. and trying to my best of possibilities.. to read th=\r\ne 13 chapters of Chandi fluently ..\n&gt; \n&gt; now i have a question to my respec=\r\nted seniors...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) i am happy that my monetary problem .. is solving ve=\r\nry fast .. but in no way i was, nor am i now .. attached to the mundane.. a=\r\nnd earthly materialistic desires...so i am a bit confused.. that getting ea=\r\nrthly benefits ..without even asking for it.. in the homam.. hope is not a =\r\nway or a procedure.. to deviate me .. from.. the sadhana.. i mean getting v=\r\nery fast results from .. the homam.. is it a way God is testing me ????\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 2) plz do correct me ,.., if at any place .. i am wrong and incorrect ,.,=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; i beg of mercy .. if i have said anything wrong .. i dont know much =\r\n. and just a beginner.. its just my devotion and faith are all that i have.=\r\n. while doing my homams..and i am sure .. i do a plenty of mistakes in my s=\r\nteps.. while doing the homam..but i am thankful that God has been merciful =\r\nenough to forgive me and bless...i am enjoying my state of bliss..and after=\r\n a very long search .. i think this is=A0 the right way meant for ..me .. m=\r\ny life has changed..and i hope it will be the same or even more.. for the n=\r\new friends who are yet to come.. i did three homams at a stretch today for =\r\nthe 1st time and i am happy for that fact very much ,, \n&gt; Despite of the fa=\r\nctor. that i havent been lucky enough . to meet or even to interact with =\r\n=A0 Manish ji ..=A0 i think of him as my Guru .. and i feel blessed at all =\r\ntimes..\n&gt; and a special thanks to Rajarshi da and Arnab ,, \n&gt;
