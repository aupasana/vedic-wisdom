If you are unable to use sesame se=\r\neds and use akshatas as a substitute for sesame seeds, it is ok to stick to=\r\n the same mantra and imagine the akshatas to be sesame seeds. That may be b=\r\netter than changing the text to &quot;akshatodakam&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sesame seeds, atleast=\r\n the white ones, are available in most places, including the west.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yo=\r\nu can collect the water in a vessel or bowl and offer it at the base of a p=\r\nlant or tree at the end of the ritual. That is better than leaving it on th=\r\ne floor.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; This fortnight is a fantastic time=\r\n to do pitri tarpanas. One can do pitri tarpana on everyday during this for=\r\ntnight and forget all other criteria.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A lot of people these days may =\r\nbenefit from pitri tarpana. The super-short procedure can be finished in 5 =\r\nminutes and makes a lot of difference over the time. These are some chakras=\r\n (energy centers) in the palm. When water flows over tham in a particular d=\r\nirection and thoughts of freedom from certain subtle influences on one&#39;s mi=\r\nnd are in one&#39;s mind at the same time, it is conducive to internal changes =\r\nwhich free one from those influences. Like with all rituals, you are engagi=\r\nng in external actions that promote certain kinds of internal transformatio=\r\nn over time. Rituals work over time, when coupled with conducive thinking.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the old days, brahmanas (i.e. people interested in knowledge, spir=\r\nitual progress and liberation) used to do a short homam and pitri tarpana e=\r\nveryday. If that is not possible, atleast doing tarpana during this fortnig=\r\nht is a great idea.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Someone asked about die=\r\nt rules etc. For any spiritual sadhaka, eating as saattwik food as one can =\r\nis always a good idea. While doing sadhanas like pitri tarpana or homam, it=\r\n is good if one can stop eating meat or atleast cut down on it. Eat as simp=\r\nle and saattwik food as possible.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;           =\r\n          http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste,\n&gt; &gt; I downloaded the Pitri Tarpan Manual 2 days ago and am planning to=\r\n start it from tomorrow for whole of this Pitri Paksha beginning with super=\r\n-short procedure.\n&gt; &gt; I could not arrange for the seasame seeds altogether.=\r\n The manual says, go with Akshats in that case. But, while I am offering th=\r\ne water with akshats (ideally seasame seeds) to Pitris in second last secti=\r\non, the mantras use the word &quot;Tilodakam&quot;. If I am right, this refers to the=\r\n seasame seeds being offered. Is it fine to continue with these mantras onl=\r\ny till I find the seasame seeds, or shall I modify it mysylf with say &quot;Aksh=\r\natodakam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; For today, I will go with as suggested, but it would be nice=\r\n if you can guide the right way in absence of such things.\n&gt; &gt; Also, is it =\r\nOK to to put a paper sheet and a vessel in front of one, and to leave the a=\r\nkshats and water after the offerings into them, than on tiled floors? And t=\r\nhen later put these water and akshats in some garden (or soil), from where =\r\nthey are absorbed into the five elements easily. From fllor it will either =\r\nbe wiped off or will get dried up there to be mopped off later. I think tha=\r\nt is not good thing to do.\n&gt; &gt; Again for today I will do the same way.
