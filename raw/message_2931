By virtue of my spending precious time on writing these ma=\r\nils, I have a right to exercise on whom I entertain for further discussion.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 4.    If you are left with even a little respect for the individuality=\r\n of another person, please ensure that you don&#39;t send unsolicited intercept=\r\ning mails particularly when your name has not been mentioned inside the mai=\r\nl.\n&gt; &gt; 5.    If you are interested in propagating your ideas, take up a new=\r\n thread, on a part of the mail and invite responses or criticism or what ev=\r\ner you want to.\n&gt; &gt; 6.     You have no right to tell others that they have =\r\na limited understanding - as you just did in your mail on Ahamkara =3D Asmi=\r\nta - till you are an omniscient being yourselves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7.    If you tri=\r\ned this sort of a thing again, I will ensure that I don&#39;t reply to any of y=\r\nour mails ever again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8.    If you don&#39;t give space to members, th=\r\nen, as a moderator, you won&#39;t ever be able to achieve the &quot;state of discipl=\r\nine and decorum&quot; and &quot;participation of group members&quot; at the same time.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 9.
