I see that y=\r\nour signature changed after the trip.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; We had a remarkable time at V=\r\naranasi. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which i=\r\ns actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is somet=\r\nhing in here which is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After c=\r\nhecking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watc=\r\nhing the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; By 9 PM Manish decided o=\r\nn doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan, on a funeral pyre=\r\n. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many great sadhakas in Hind=\r\nuism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various sadh=\r\nanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=A0spent most of his=\r\n days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=A0The effect that a Samsha=\r\nn has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for those who have such =\r\ninclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funeral pyre i=\r\ns called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of a standar=\r\nd homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and many in number, who has=\r\n used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not to make a distincti=\r\non between pure and impure.If someone feels that a funeral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;=\r\n, he or she would be better off not trying anything in such a fire. The mai=\r\nn deities of a samshan bhoomi are Mahakala and\n&gt;  Mahakali. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0We =\r\nwent to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of=A0full coconuts=\r\n, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =A0kismis, havan samagri. While buying=\r\n the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly=\r\n a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop=\r\n on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Man=\r\nish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was=\r\n eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the =\r\nsamagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round=\r\n and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhe=\r\nre. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish sm=\r\niled and said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we=A0had bec=\r\nome so big sadhakas that we=A0are unable to feed a hungry child=A0. That is=\r\n how God comes to test people.=A0Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha aur=A0kis\n&gt;  ro=\r\nop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in a comb=\r\nination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the samshan at=\r\n around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people who work =\r\nthere to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at least 8 to =\r\n10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pitch bla=\r\nck at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease out a bit, n=\r\not sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to react. As=\r\n we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of curiosity=\r\n=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes and medit=\r\nated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous energy. Some=\r\nthing of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity.=\r\n While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too turned. I co=\r\nuld see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs in the sams=\r\nhan went running=A0to\n&gt;  that direction.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; After waiting like this fo=\r\nr about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major por=\r\ntion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some tim=\r\ne still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offering =\r\nwas of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync w=\r\nith his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the =\r\nambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were upto. =\r\nBut no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to l=\r\night other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking pi=\r\neces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to him n=\r\not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb that=\r\n pyre again. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack =\r\nof 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was=\r\n being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, f=\r\nrom all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it=\r\n tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching =\r\nus or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Ver=\r\ny nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron=\r\n and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind a=\r\nway to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally=A0a=\r\nccustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from the pa=\r\nck which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish=\r\n. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in an an=\r\ngular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not an ani=\r\nmal but a human being\n&gt;  watching. Just staring and observing every action.=\r\n Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; T=\r\nhe homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well as=\r\n in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few notch=\r\nes above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Simply being in=\r\n a samshan and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on=\r\n the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body b=\r\nurning. Both the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setti=\r\nng, this kind of a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which =\r\nhas a very sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked=\r\n a feeling of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something fa=\r\nr more real and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc wi=\r\nll perish as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Man=\r\nish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to pleas=\r\ne God through sadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor =\r\ndesirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will=\r\n ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings =\r\nwill disturb you because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worship=\r\nping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily sca=\r\nred of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them no=\r\nr will they bother you. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=A0attitud=\r\ne to have. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa i=\r\ns being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\nThus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That nigh=\r\nt was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik=\r\n. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; ...to be continued...\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Ram=\r\na Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personality.
