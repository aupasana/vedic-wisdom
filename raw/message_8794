My take on it.\n\n=C2=A0\n\n&lt;&lt;But how does one identify the boundary =\r\nat which you stop following a rule? Many a times, I find keeping count of m=\r\nantras slightly distracting and feel that I \nshould instead just sit and me=\r\nditate for some time. May be more time \nsome day and less time on other day=\r\ns.&gt;&gt;\n\nThe boundary has to be determined by the seeker himself/herself, or i=\r\nf he/she has a Guru who has accomplished the full sadhana of that specific =\r\npath, or an uttara-sadhaka (a more advanced sadhaka). All fixed rules are b=\r\nased on circumstances when the rules are set. From time to time the rules n=\r\need to be modified, added, or subtracted or improvised based on current sit=\r\nuations.\n\nLet me give you an example. There are some people here who do Cha=\r\nndipath and Chandi homas. Now the historically, the Sri Sri Chandi is a Tan=\r\ntric text which was the mainstay on Kali-Kula Tantric Paramparas for ages. =\r\nMaximum worship, and siddhis of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana has happened from pa=\r\nramparas originating and centering around the Kamakhya Shakti Peetha. These=\r\n paramparas had fantastic Gurus, some of whom were really Mahasiddhas. If y=\r\nou follow the texts from these paramparas, which are very ancient, one shou=\r\nld not even touch the book of Sri Sri Chandi until one has been given a gen=\r\nuine Shaktipath diksha by a competent Guru. First there is a Shakta Abhisek=\r\nh, then=C2=A0 once a certain level is reached a PurnaAbhisekh, and in some =\r\nrare cases a BhairavaAbhisekh. Moreover, the Tantras are clear that to achi=\r\neve the grace of Sri Sri Chandi a sadhaka must stay completely alone and do=\r\n the sadhana in a deserted shiva-temple, or inside a forest where humans do=\r\n not\n enter, on a hill-top where people do not live, near a river bank unde=\r\nr certain specific trees where there is no habitation nearby , or a smashan=\r\n which is away from the city. These were the original instructions and whoe=\r\nver did not follow the same can, it was said, fall in serious trouble inclu=\r\nding but not limited to death. But over time, many other people have done s=\r\nadhana of Sri Sri Chandi, often not following all the laid down rules or im=\r\nprovising on them, and yet achieved various degrees of high **realizations.=\r\n So rules need to understood first, and the reinterpreted based on circumst=\r\nances.\n\nSimilarly for everything there are many rules laid out at various p=\r\noints of time by great masters, which are at times even contradictory, and =\r\nthey have a deeper reason too. But if you can figure out the reason behind =\r\nthe rules, or someone helps you to figure out the reason, then you can very=\r\n well improvise based on your current situation. At any cost, it is good an=\r\nd nice to have some joy in your sadhana by maintaining a right balance betw=\r\neen being too strict on rules vs following what thoughts come naturally to =\r\naid your sadhana.\n\n\nThe word meditation in English really covers two differ=\r\nent concepts. a) Concentration. b) Contemplation.\n\nFor concentration you si=\r\nt in an asana and fix your thoughts on something, be it a mantra or a deity=\r\n ETC. This need \na still body and then a still mind. First the mind will be=\r\ncome calm. Then eventually the mind will become quite. In a normal human mi=\r\nnd there is a constant running commentary going on. That needs to be stoppe=\r\nd eventually. When that is done, without or without a mantra, various kinds=\r\n of interesting experiences come to the seeker. But the problem with this m=\r\nethod is that, its gains are often limited to only the time frame when you =\r\nare stilling and concentrating. Once you go back to teh world, your gains a=\r\nre either lost or frittered away. It takes a really long time to get such a=\r\n one-off experience in focused concentration which is powerful enough to ch=\r\nange your surface personality even during other times. For most seekers, su=\r\nch a thing never happens. \n\nContemplation is when you keep your focus on a =\r\nmantra or a deity even with engaging in all kinds of activities. This is a =\r\nprocess of knowing by becoming. If you keep contemplating constantly for da=\r\nys on end on one specific things, you will often gain some knowlege/underst=\r\nanding about it by way of association. This is a very useful sadhana. Unlik=\r\ne concentration, this can be and is ment to be done even while doing all ot=\r\nher things. \n\nWhen you do both, that is focused concentration while keeping=\r\n the body still, and contemplation of Divine at all points even when engage=\r\nd in other activities, then a dual effect accrues in your system which has =\r\na greater chance of changing your surface daily personality. For all sadhan=\r\na eventually must do just that.\n\n\n**realization, the English word, is super=\r\n vague. In spirituality, if one does an objective reckoning of scriptures, =\r\npaths, sadhanas, and experiences of various legendary sadhakas one will see=\r\n that there are vast multidimensional number and nature of great spiritual =\r\nrealizations. And they are not similar at all. It is a complex and interest=\r\ning study in itself. The proverbial reality is One, but it is so complex th=\r\nat few, even among greats, have ever had a complete realization of all aspe=\r\ncts of the One. \n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyan=\r\ntE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n____=\r\n____________________________\n From: vishal vijaywargiya &lt;vishal_vijaywargiy=\r\na@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Wednesday, 24 October =\r\n2012 1:34 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: The way of a pilgrim\n \n\n=C2=A0=\r\n \nDear Rakeshji and other learned members of the group,\n\nI had one clarific=\r\nation on the point of being flexible with the rules.

It&#39;=\r\ns about a man who succeeds in constant rememberance of God.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In a nut=\r\nshell, it&#39;s an (annonymous) autobiography of an average man from 19th centu=\r\nry Russia who began to repeat a Christian &#39;mantra&#39; called the Jesus prayer.=\r\n..&quot;Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me a sinner&quot;...day in and day out (after=\r\n his wife died and he was drawn to the spiritual path). And slowly he expla=\r\nins how the mantra began to repeat itself constantly in his mind without hi=\r\nm having to do anything. He solves the problems of mind-wandering and attai=\r\nns\n&gt;&gt; one-pointedness, and various spiritual truths are slowly revealed to =\r\nhim.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; By the way, is there anyone on the forum who has actually exper=\r\nienced this state? If yes, please can you advise how you got there? How did=\r\n you overcome obstacles such as laziness, boredom, forgetfullness, mind-wan=\r\ndering etc? It would be inspiring to hear your experiences. Reading stories=\r\n of highly exalted God realised beings is fine, but it&#39;s difficult to relat=\r\ne to them (they seem so far advanced). It sometimes helps to hear from some=\r\none who was just like you, and how they worked on themselves.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Coming=\r\n back to the book, in the first chapter, he is a &#39;spiritual baby&#39; just star=\r\nting out on the path and completely ignorant (was an ordinary householder, =\r\nbut then wife died and his house burnt down and he became poor) He reads in=\r\n the Bible &quot;pray unceasingly&quot; and becomes fascinated with this idea.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n He meets a Guru (an elderly monk) and said &quot;I want to pray unceasingly but=\r\n I don&#39;t know how&quot;. Guru taught him the Jesus prayer and said do 3000 repet=\r\nions a day of the prayer for one week, 6000 a day the week after, and 12000=\r\n a day the week after that! After 12000 repetitions a day, he says his tong=\r\nue felt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb were hurting a little from counting=\r\n the beads on his\n&gt;&gt; rosary! But he followed his Guru&#39;s instructions fully.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Later the Guru said, well done...now it&#39;s time to repeat this praye=\r\nr all the time, keeping other thoughts away as much as possible! How is thi=\r\ns possible asks the student (as many of us may also ask). The Guru said jus=\r\nt try. He tries, and succeeds.

But the problem with this method is that, its gains are often limited t=\r\no only the time frame when you are stilling and concentrating. Once you go =\r\nback to teh world, your gains are either lost or frittered away. It takes a=\r\n really long time to get such a one-off experience in focused concentration=\r\n which is powerful enough to change your surface personality even during ot=\r\nher times. For most seekers, such a thing never happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contemplat=\r\nion is when you keep your focus on a mantra or a deity even with engaging i=\r\nn all kinds of activities. This is a process of knowing by becoming. If you=\r\n keep contemplating constantly for days on end on one specific things, you =\r\nwill often gain some knowlege/understanding about it by way of\n association=\r\n. This is a very useful sadhana. Unlike concentration, this can be and is m=\r\nent to be done even while doing all other things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you do both,=\r\n that is focused concentration while keeping the body still, and contemplat=\r\nion of Divine at all points even when engaged in other activities, then a d=\r\nual effect accrues in your system which has a greater chance of changing yo=\r\nur surface daily personality. For all sadhana eventually must do just that.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**realization, the English word, is super vague. In spiritualit=\r\ny, if one does an objective reckoning of scriptures, paths, sadhanas, and e=\r\nxperiences of various legendary sadhakas one will see that there are vast m=\r\nultidimensional number and nature of great spiritual realizations. And they=\r\n are not similar at all. It is a complex and interesting study in itself. T=\r\nhe proverbial reality is One, but it is so complex that few, even among gre=\r\nats, have ever had a complete realization of all aspects\n of the One. &lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D=\r\n&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam ma=\r\nnyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227=\r\n946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_7_2_27_1351102131325_71&quot; style=3D&quot;FON=\r\nT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||=\r\n[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-seri=\r\nf; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york,=\r\n times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vishal vijaywargiya &lt;vishal_vijaywargiya@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, 24 =\r\nOctober 2012 1:34 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: The way of a pilgrim&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1=\r\n649893273&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1649893273ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;table borde=\r\nr=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font:in=\r\nherit;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;Dear Rakeshji and other learned members of the group=\r\n,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had one clarification on the point of being flexible=\r\n with the rules. As per my understanding from other emails in this group, o=\r\nne should always start with a rule and then gradually move over to complete=\r\n surrender wherein there are no rules. A kid who wants to run a marathon ne=\r\neds to follow rules/discipline for practicing daily. Once he has developed =\r\na practice routine, it is ok even if he doesnt follow rules. Similarly for =\r\nthis long journey towards realization.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But how doe=\r\ns one identify the boundary at which you stop following a rule? Many a time=\r\ns, I find keeping count of mantras slightly distracting and feel that I sho=\r\nuld instead just sit and meditate for some time. May be more time some day =\r\nand less time on other days.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any\n advice or\n pract=\r\nical pointers in this regard will be very helpful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vishal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Tue, 23/10/12, rakesh.beha=\r\nl &lt;i&gt;&lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;=\r\nborder-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.=\r\nbehal@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: The way of a pilgrim&lt;br&gt;=\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Tuesday, 23 October, 2012, 11:01 =\r\nAM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1649893273&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1649893273ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear A=\r\nparana,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMantra is done like this : &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nonce while inhaling a=\r\nnd once while exhaling.&lt;br&gt;\nthrough continuous efforts a stage automaticall=\r\ny comes when it gets embeded in our breathing system and then it runs with =\r\nour rhythem.&lt;br&gt;\nIt all depends upon HIS grace, keep on putting efforts.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nBut do not count mantra, it is only for initial stages when u count,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n even while counting ur focus is on numbers which is bad&lt;br&gt;\nit is the only=\r\n  ceaseles pray , japa which is best.through practice it is possible and po=\r\nssible when one has deep love for God.&lt;br&gt;\nEven mantra stops at advance sta=\r\nges as then soul itself travels further.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMantra=3Done which keeps =\r\nmind here in present&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\none can Meet HIM when one does not have any d=\r\nesire and I have seen ur many mails and even this desire should not be ther=\r\ne that when we will relise HIM&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUSKE LIYE ITNI TADAP HO ki WO MAZBO=\r\nOR HO JAYE AANE KE LIYE.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSee Hanuman ji , his body was immersed in=\r\n Ram nam, he never desired anything.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThese is no rule, those who f=\r\nollow rule , they have time to see rules but those who r immersed in HIS LO=\r\nVE , they feel their body is just tool through which HE is working.their   =\r\nI     dies.&lt;br&gt;\nsee Gopis in Love of Krishna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is HIS will, accep=\r\nt in all circumstances, Surrender is the key, Be kid, new born baby, who do=\r\nes not know anything except his mother,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDid Shabri from Ramayan fo=\r\nllowd any rules, rules apply for Sakam Bhakti, means there r desires, avod =\r\nall this, no desire of even realising HIM,it will also bloch.ceasless pray,=\r\n and keep dhayan of HIM &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\none should remeber HIM in Mahkhane or Pak=\r\nhana, where is HE not present, who except HIM is presnt.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRealised =\r\nperson see HIM everywheer and nothing else.becuse theer is no Duality&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nU R DOCTOR, SEE ur patients as LORD , u r also LORD , LORD in form of =\r\n doctor , serving LORD patients.&lt;br&gt;\nwhere r u, HE IS alone.Transform ur th=\r\nought process like this wheer thoughts will reduce to one just GOD.&lt;br&gt;\nTea=\r\nch ur mind this ,when  Mind understands , it starts helping.Donot seek rule=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;\nRule following people can never Realise HIM.What so ever way u can c=\r\nonnect to HIM , do that way, &lt;br&gt;\nHe will guide u  through u only LISTEN to=\r\n HIM , inside u  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHope it helps&lt;br&gt;\nregards&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &l=\r\nt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;They way of a pilgrim&quot; is very interesting book that I have just star=\r\nted to read. It&#39;s about a man who succeeds in constant rememberance of God.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In a nutshell, it&#39;s an (annonymous) autobiography of an=\r\n average man from 19th century Russia who began to repeat a Christian &#39;mant=\r\nra&#39; called the Jesus prayer...&quot;Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me a sinner&quot;=\r\n...day in and day out (after his wife died and he was drawn to the spiritua=\r\nl path). And slowly he explains how the mantra began to repeat itself const=\r\nantly in his mind without him having to do anything. He solves the problems=\r\n of mind-wandering and attains&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one-pointedness, and various spirit=\r\nual truths are slowly revealed to him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; By the way, is th=\r\nere anyone on the forum who has actually experienced this state? If yes, pl=\r\nease can you advise how you got there? How did you overcome obstacles such =\r\nas laziness, boredom, forgetfullness, mind-wandering etc? It would be inspi=\r\nring to hear your experiences. Reading stories of highly exalted God realis=\r\ned beings is fine, but it&#39;s difficult to relate to them (they seem so far a=\r\ndvanced). It sometimes helps to hear from someone who was just like you, an=\r\nd how they worked on themselves.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Coming back to the book=\r\n, in the first chapter, he is a &#39;spiritual baby&#39; just starting out on the p=\r\nath and completely ignorant (was an ordinary householder, but then wife die=\r\nd and his house burnt down and he became poor) He reads in the Bible &quot;pray =\r\nunceasingly&quot; and becomes fascinated with this idea.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He m=\r\neets a Guru (an elderly monk) and said &quot;I want to pray unceasingly but I do=\r\nn&#39;t know how&quot;. Guru taught him the Jesus prayer and said do 3000 repetions =\r\na day of the prayer for one week, 6000 a day the week after, and 12000 a da=\r\ny the week after that! After 12000 repetitions a day, he says his tongue fe=\r\nlt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb were hurting a little from counting the =\r\nbeads on his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rosary! But he followed his Guru&#39;s instructions fully=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Later the Guru said, well done...now it&#39;s time to repe=\r\nat this prayer all the time, keeping other thoughts away as much as possibl=\r\ne! How is this possible asks the student (as many of us may also ask). The =\r\nGuru said just try. He tries, and succeeds.
