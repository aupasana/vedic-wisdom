That fire will be quite sufficient to burn some =\r\nunburnt coconut peices if any and other materials offered in the Kunda. \n\nY=\r\nou will not need to then open your eyes or worry. everything will be burnt =\r\ncompletely.\n\ntry it once and see if it happens.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jitender Dahiya&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Utpal and KK for such a prompt reply. \n&gt; @Utpal--=\r\nBut the problem i face is even if there is unburnt coconut in fire i need t=\r\noo add ghee from time to time otherwise that extra ghee added before medita=\r\ntion goes and gets accumulated in the bottom.\n&gt; The fire would go off after=\r\n 5-7 minutes of starting my mediattion if i dont give some attentiion to it=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; @KK-- as far as i doing another homam as quickly  is possible, i try=\r\n to do that everyday.
