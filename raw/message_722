Doing it in the open is actually\n&gt; better than doing it in clos=\r\ned space. But realize that a rain can\n&gt; cause problems. Keep an umbrella ar=\r\nound to protect the fire if it\n&gt; rains while you are doing homam. It is not=\r\n good if fire is\n&gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nYes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the\n&gt; bottom. =\r\nUse a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam usi=\r\nng the mp3 audio file, should one\n&gt; repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along=\r\n with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while listening attentive=\r\nly (not casually).\n&gt; Actually, even listening to mantras with all the atten=\r\ntion focused is\n&gt; as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suppose person X =\r\nis chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane\n&gt; matter in the mind. Sup=\r\npose person Y is listening to it with focus and\n&gt; thinking of the mantra an=\r\nd its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing\n&gt; for person X and yet person Y=\r\n may benefit from the mantra. The word\n&gt; mantra means &quot;one that protects th=\r\ne mind&quot;. One can say a mantra or\n&gt; listen to a mantra, to be protected. The=\r\n key is control over the mind\n&gt; and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mant=\r\nra\n&gt; is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in=\r\n\n&gt; the external fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound\n&gt; (e=\r\nven if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just\n&gt; liste=\r\nning. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Hom=\r\nam? Any Other\n&gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from=\r\n having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thr=\r\nead ceremony) has been\n&gt; performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrele=\r\nvant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. W=\r\nhatever\n&gt; rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the\n&gt; =\r\nminimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and\n&gt; take=\r\n a bath before homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid\n&gt; eating an=\r\ny solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sa=\r\ncred thread wants to do homam for\n&gt; spiritual progress, I am willing to tak=\r\ne responsibility and allow them\n&gt; to do it. Such a person can think of me o=\r\nr my guru as guru and perform\n&gt; homam. I am willing to take on any karma in=\r\ncurred in the process until\n&gt; the person crosses some minimum threshhold of=\r\n purity through homam and\n&gt; other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no =\r\nsacred thread,\n&gt; mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after =\r\na while,\n&gt; when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upan=\r\nayanam\n&gt; and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up and make the pe=\r\nrson\n&gt; cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As long as one desires no s=\r\npecific material benefits (and ready to\n&gt; receive whatever god gives) and d=\r\noes homam for spiritual progress, I\n&gt; am willing to help, even if it means =\r\nsome suffering for me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or an=\r\ny day would be fine?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chatur=\r\nthi morning. But any\n&gt; day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mentioni=\r\nng rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I wen=\r\nt to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled\n&gt; together to several=\r\n places (on a specific project). We ended up doing\n&gt; homam in the morning i=\r\nn several places (wherever we were). Before the\n&gt; trip, my guru told me to =\r\ncarry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come\n&gt; only in June/July in India, I=\r\n did not take it seriously. We were in\n&gt; New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded=\r\n to the rooftop of the apartment\n&gt; complex we were in, to do a homam. Manis=\r\nh told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is\n&gt; going to rain heavily in this city after our=\r\n homam finishes&quot;. I just\n&gt; smiled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as =\r\nsoon as our homas finished. After we\n&gt; offered poornaahuti, it suddenly sta=\r\nrted raining with really big\n&gt; drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blan=\r\nket on the rooftop close\n&gt; to us. Together, we held it on top of the two sm=\r\nall homa kundas,\n&gt; closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover o=\r\nn the homa\n&gt; kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and then pac=\r\nked\n&gt; everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but=\r\n\n&gt; we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi.\n&gt; =\r\nIn fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the north, east\n&gt; and =\r\nwest of India. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished\n&gt; our ta=\r\nsk in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimp=\r\nle@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doin=\r\ng Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few\n&gt; questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) ?=\r\n\n&gt; Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be=\r\n used\n&gt; instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam u=\r\nsing the mp3 audio file, should one\n&gt; repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally alo=\r\nng with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam?
