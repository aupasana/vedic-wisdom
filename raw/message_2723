At least I unders=\r\ntand it in a consistent framework now. Technically speaking, to unify both =\r\nframeworks into a common ground, both frameworks seem to agree that the chi=\r\ntta of sookshma-sarira is not the pure chitta of brahman. The chitta of soo=\r\nkshma sarira has material impurity in it/has a material carrier. Your frame=\r\nwork calls this material carrier the 6th tattwa, whereas in the VC framewor=\r\nk, it seems logical to infer that the material carrier is some combination =\r\nof the 5 tattwas. Also, your framework (by your own words), seems to imply =\r\nthat the 6th tattwa is the source of all the other 5, which are formed out =\r\nof it *in parallel*, so to say. To cut a long line of reasoning short and g=\r\net to the meat of the matter, I have one more question (so I can continue t=\r\no unify the frameworks): (a) Is there a level of realization in which the 5=\r\n tattwas are calm, and only the 6th is active (b) Does this state have Aham=\r\nkara or not/does it correspond to any well known chakra?\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yeeahoo_99&quot; &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; \n&gt;    I have not read VC, no use =\r\ntelling me all that.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Enumerating what I know about it :\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. &quot;Su=\r\nperEther&quot; - a term coined by Paramahansa Yogananda for\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. an infinitel=\r\ny finer &quot;non-material&quot; tattwa, of which the causal cosmos - Isvara - is com=\r\nposed of.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. It dissolves and creates Aakash tattwa, which constitutes=\r\n and separates various layers of vibratroy material as the astral and physi=\r\ncal cosmos.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. It is supported by Sankhya in the creation of the 4 ant=\r\nahkarana principles - Buddhi, Manas, Ahamkara, and Chitta. These are non-ma=\r\nterial conscious principles, while any of the rest of 20 principles do not =\r\ncarry consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. It is created as a result of &quot;Satvic-Tamas&quot; Gu=\r\nna Combination.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Whether you find a mention to this non-material tat=\r\ntwa or not, is immaterial. The indescribable consciousness of Soul, reflect=\r\ns through the help of this tattwa alone - you call it Mind-ether as Sri Ram=\r\nana Maharishi or superEther as Yogananda, it doesn&#39;t matter. Thats it.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 7.  For your interest, I am giving you the reference of talks with Sri Ram=\r\nana Maharishi - please, don&#39;t drag me in a discussion because am clear abou=\r\nt it, but you may resolve all your doubts by reading the talks. Here is an =\r\nExcerpt (Page 560):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...Chidakasa (chit-ether) is Pure Knowledge only,=\r\n It is the source\n&gt; of mind. Just at the moment of rising up, the mind is o=\r\nnly light;\n&gt; only afterwards the thought &quot;I am this&quot; rises up; this `I-thou=\r\nght&#39;\n&gt; forms the jiva and the world.\n&gt; \n&gt;    The first light is the pure mi=\r\nnd, the mind ether or Isvara. Its modes manifest as objects. Because it con=\r\ntains all these objects within itself it is called the mind-ether. Why ethe=\r\nr? Like ether containing objects it contains the thoughts, therefore it is =\r\nthe mind-ether.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Again, just as the physical ether though accommodat=\r\ning all the gross objects (the whole universe) is itself the content of the=\r\n mind-ether, so also the latter is itself the content of Chit-ether. The la=\r\nst one is Chit Itself. There are no things contained in it. It remains as P=\r\nure Knowledge only....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ON 3 GUNAS\n&gt; \n&gt; Satva is the light,\n&gt; Rajas=\r\n is the subject, and\n&gt; Tamas is the object.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Even the satva light is =\r\nonly reflected light. Were it pure, original Light, there would be no modif=\r\nication in it. The manokasa (mind-ether) is reflected as bhootakasa (elemen=\r\nt-ether) and objects are seen as being separate from the subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Nitish\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostude=\r\nnt&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You clearly contra=\r\ndict Adi Sankara&#39;s Vivekacudamani (VC from here on). Please tell us why we =\r\nshould listen to you, not him. Specifically, you insist chitta is a tattwa.=\r\n Whereas when VC uses the word Chitta as a verb, i.e. consciousness, then t=\r\nhis property is only possessed by Brahman because only it is Sat-chitta-ana=\r\nnda. When VC uses this word as a noun, it is used as a modification of anta=\r\nhakarana (whose other three modifications are manas, ahamkara and buddhi). =\r\nSo to put this is context, VC clearly implies that at the material level of=\r\n tattwas, we see the Linga Sarira. One of the constructs of Linga sarira is=\r\n antahakrana. One of its &quot;modifications&quot; is chitta. I take this to mean (si=\r\nnce I take that only Brahman can have true chitta (verb))it is that propert=\r\ny of the antahakarana that, when enlivened by Brahman, gives awareness/cons=\r\nciousness to the Linga sarira.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How exactly am I wrong. Only facts =\r\nand explanations please, no proof by ridicule/intimidation. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRegards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patanjalis&#39; Chitta Vrit=\r\ntis&#39; correspond to the 5 tattwas and are all happening on the background of=\r\n Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tattwa. The normal-human- experience happens=\r\n by the 5 modifications/ movement of Chitta (finest creation).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n How would the Soul become aware of the more material Aakash Tattwa (and th=\r\nus a single coherent self pervading the material physical body), if it were=\r\n not standing behind the Chitta (SuperEther) ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, all our e=\r\nxperiences of matter are through non-material Chitta, and it doesn&#39;t imply =\r\nthat 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist. If you could calm all those modifications of=\r\n Chitta, you would have your self-realized.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Aajnaa chakra=\r\n lies the primordial state of the universe where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is just spac=\r\ne and time, but no five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing comes out from nothi=\r\nng. How can the lower tattwas evolve from higher tattwas, if even their sub=\r\ntle representations are purged from existence altogether ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gre=\r\natest of the Seers have already put down the scriptures in writing, so that=\r\n people like us can benefit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
