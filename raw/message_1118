I have learnt some lessons after this \nshoot.\n&gt;       I h=\r\nave known Narasimhaji for over 10 years, I first met him \nin July 1998. I m=\r\narried his wife&#39;s sister in Jan 1999. I used to \nlive in New Jersey and oft=\r\nen visit Narasimhaji&#39;s family (almost \nevery month) until Nov 2005, when de=\r\nstiny moved me permanently close \nto him (Boston). I lived for 6 months in =\r\nhis home. He looked after \nme as his own brother during those  months. Agai=\r\nn, destiny, I bought \na home just 3 homes away from his. Even though 3 home=\r\ns apart, many \nof our weekends are spent in either of our homes. Since day =\r\none, I \nhad a lot of respect for him. I also admired his in-depth knowledge=\r\n \nin various areas.\n&gt;       On Jan 31st morning, Narasimhaji setup everythi=\r\nng necessary \nfor Homam. I quickly went through various options in the Camc=\r\norder. \nNarasimhaji said &quot;Ravi Shall we start&quot;. I looked at him and was \nme=\r\nsmerized by the look in his face, him sitting in front of the homa \nkundam.=\r\n Even after so many years of association, all of a sudden I \nfelt like an a=\r\nnt at the tip of Mt.Everest that has been just told to \nclimb the Everest, =\r\nthe whole shooting idea looked like an uphill \ntask for me. I was trembling=\r\n, I said yes, let&#39;s start and started \nrecording, my hands still shaking. I=\r\nf you closely look at the first \n10-12 secs of the video, you will notice t=\r\nhe shake in the camera.   \n&gt;       He has lost a lot of weight over the las=\r\nt 5 years or so. \nWith the clothes that he put on in the video, it is not s=\r\neen, but he \nis much thinner and with the beard gone now, he looks much you=\r\nnger, \nmuch different. Internal changes bring about external changes and he=\r\n \nhas gone through ton of them. His actions/words speak all these. I \nam no=\r\nt bored listening him talk on the same topics over and over and \nover and o=\r\nver...  I am not bored reading his writings in this forum \nover and over an=\r\nd over and over...  \n&gt;       As Narayan once said, we are grateful to have =\r\nNarasimhaji \nand Manishji guide us through our lives.\n&gt; \n&gt;       I have lea=\r\nrnt a lot from Masterji and there is lot more to \nlearn.\n&gt; I sincerely bow =\r\ndown to Masterji. I salute him for his dedication \nand\n&gt; unselfish service =\r\nto the world. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Ravi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________=\r\n______\n&gt; From: m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; S=\r\nent: Friday, February 6, 2009 10:21:26 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Regardi=\r\nng Homam video\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; The video is very good, Good work by th=\r\ne video grapher and \nNarasimha.\n&gt; It was a pleasure watching it and I feel =\r\nthat I will watch it a \nfew \n&gt; more times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most importantly I want to =\r\nbring out the fact that when one does a \nlot\n&gt; japams and homams, the good =\r\nwork is reflected in the persons face, \n&gt; the lustre etc. Although I have n=\r\not met Narasimha ever, I have \nseen \n&gt; one picture of him may be from many =\r\nyears ago and now the video. \n&gt; There is a striking difference between the =\r\ntwo.\n&gt; \n&gt; The transformation internally may be more intense and fantanstic.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On a different note, I have heard from a very realized soul that\n&gt; Th=\r\ne Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks is \nreserved \n&gt; for=\r\n them, it is not advisible for people like us married or single \nto \n&gt; put =\r\nit on.
