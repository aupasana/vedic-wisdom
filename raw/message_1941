Ensure the =\r\nprasadam is consumed by the pregnant lady as she also nourishes the fetus. =\r\n\n\nThe devas/devis whom we propitiate and seek blessings from are all ethere=\r\nal beings in subtle forms, and as such they eat/accept prasadams/naivedyam/=\r\nofferings through the sense of smell, which is of a very superior order. He=\r\nnce, it is better to avoid:\n\n1. Smelling the naivedyam/offerings before off=\r\nering to the devas/devis, as this would \n    tantamount to offering soiled =\r\nfood. Would you accept soiled food from your host?\n    The same rules appli=\r\nes to the divine beings too.\n\n2. Women in their periods (mentruating) emana=\r\nte a smell which may not be detected\n    by human beings olfactory senses, =\r\nhowever, the devis/devas can detect it instantly, \n    and are repelled by =\r\nit. Its like you are being invited to dinner at your friends place and\n    =\r\ngarbage and foul smell permeate the house, would you feel respected or even=\r\n \n    comfortable in such an ambience? No. The same is the thing with divin=\r\ne beings.\n\n3. Some basic cleanliness procedure like bathing has to be obser=\r\nved. Even \n    Aghoris/tantriks who do sadhana in smashan (crematorium) obs=\r\nervere basic\n    cleanliness procedure before starting their ritual.\n\nHope =\r\nthis helps.\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, manish=\r\n gour &lt;manishgo_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; Is=\r\n there any restrictions on pregnant woman doing/attending homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns,\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Explore and discover exciting holidays and get=\r\naways with Yahoo!
