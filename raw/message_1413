Again the thought of accruing unnecessary karma..is stopping me. Ca=\r\nn you plese clarify which is a big sin / karma of these two. (karma of not =\r\ngiving alms to those beggars vs getting karma of their misuse).\n\nThanks\nKri=\r\nshna Kanth\n\nP.S: I totally agree with your point of the bad karma becuase o=\r\nf misuse of the money we donate, but this is putting in a fix with the thou=\r\nght that probably i&#39;m not able to help the really needy guys (i typically o=\r\nnly use to give money to very disabled and elderly people). \n\n\n\n\n"}}
