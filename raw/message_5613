This is the =\r\nfirst law of Karma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Giving a potentially life-altering astrological r=\r\neading is an action that will have a reaction. Doing so for financial rewar=\r\nds, pre-determined (fee) or completely left to the client (dakshina), will =\r\nfurther complicate the equation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, giving astrological readings, f=\r\nreely or for a fee (including &quot;recommended&quot; dakshina) or for a dakshina (i.=\r\ne. totally voluntary), is not the only action we engage in. We engage in so=\r\n many actions, some better and some worse.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One with bad vaasanaas (me=\r\nntal conditioning) engages in wrong actions or in correct actions with wron=\r\ng attitude, and pays for it later. Who are we to tell people what to do? Ca=\r\nn we convert the whole world into gods or make everyone god-realized? Peopl=\r\ne will evolve spiritually at their own pace, determined by the the density =\r\nof the kaarmic baggage they carry.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you consider someone to be your=\r\n sishya in Jyotish, you may tell the person what to do. With other people, =\r\nyou have to maintain respect and assert your views gently, delicately and i=\r\nnoffensively.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        * \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a different private threa=\r\nd, someone wrote the following to me yesterday. It may be relevant when we =\r\nare discussing astrology and fees. I am not an emotional person, but this m=\r\nade my eyes wet. If I was there, I would&#39;ve washed the feet of this beggar =\r\nand sprinkled the water on my head. This kind of pure thinking is so diffic=\r\nult to find now-a-days...\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Once when I was in Alandi, I heard two bli=\r\nnd beggars talk inside the temple presmises. One of them said that he has r=\r\necently been initiated by someone into the Varkari path and he can now sing=\r\n Abhags (spiritual songs in Marathi) in the company of other initiates. He =\r\nwas very happy. The other beggar asked him, why don&#39;t you sing the abhangs =\r\nwhen you beg. You will get more money, your singing is terrific. The first =\r\nman replied that he cannot use songs of God for earning money, even if the =\r\nmoney is coming through begging. God is beyond everything else. Begging is =\r\nfor my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not mix the two.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;When =\r\nI heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also there) I was stunned. This coming from a beg=\r\nger! This created a strong impact on my mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Such is the power of G=\r\nyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the consciousness of all who go there.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nBTW, Krishna temple at Alandi, where Gyaneshwar Maharaj is believed to be s=\r\ntill meditating in the underground chamber (I have no doubt about it), is o=\r\nne of the most spiritually charged places I have been to. Tiruvannamalai, G=\r\nirnar, Mayapur and Dakshineshwar are some other places that are alive with =\r\nspiritual energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;   =\r\n   Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
