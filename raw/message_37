Let me try to give a =\r\nsimple (and simplistic) answer.\n\nSupreme cosmic being (Brahman) does not cr=\r\neate or destroy anything. Supreme cosmic being has no gunas (attributes/qua=\r\nlities/properties) whatsoever. Though all possible objects, qualities and a=\r\nttributes lie within Brahman as a pontentiality, Brahman himself/herself/it=\r\nself does not have any attributes. At time minus infinity, there was just B=\r\nrahman and no objects within. The whole universe was filled with Brahman an=\r\nd nothing else.\n\nThen a minute part of Brahman developed an ego (I-ness or =\r\nsense of &quot;I&quot;). Sense of &quot;I&quot; requires some attributes. So, this part of Brah=\r\nman formed an identity based on certain attributes. As a minute part of the=\r\n ocean may form itself as a wave and think of itself as a small wave instea=\r\nd of thinking of itself as ocean (which it really is), this being thinks of=\r\n himself as a different being from Brahman.\n\nThus, several gods with variou=\r\ns attributes come into being. Please note that they are all different from =\r\nBrahman and limited in their scope, bound by the attributes that they have =\r\ngiven to themselves.\n\nThe creator Brahma (different from attribute-less Bra=\r\nhman) comes into being like that from the Supreme Cosmic Being. The attribu=\r\ntes he thinks of when coming into being and forming an ego make him create =\r\nvarious other beings in this world. He sees it as his purpose.\n\nWhen we hav=\r\ne a dream in our sleep, we fashion a small part of Brahman as various dream=\r\n objects with certain attributes. Similarly, Brahma fashions a minute part =\r\nof Brahman as various world objects - such as you and I - with certain attr=\r\nibutes.\n\nThese objects (you and I) have a sense of &quot;I&quot; based on the attribu=\r\ntes imagined by Brahma and they go on interacting with other objects (just =\r\nas objects we see in our dreams interact with each other).\n\nAs we experienc=\r\ne and interact with more and more objects, the sense of &quot;I&quot; becomes very ve=\r\nry dense. After a while, we totally forget that we are actually attribute-l=\r\ness Brahman. We think that we have certain attributes and our attributes de=\r\ntermine our purpose in life.\n\nOne of the purposes dictated by the attribute=\r\ns taken by Brahma when he came into being was to create some other deities.=\r\n Those deities are also made from minute portions of Brahman with several a=\r\nttributes. Those attributes decide some purposes for them. These purposes h=\r\nave been designed so that there is some order in this world.\n\nThe world is =\r\nhence full of beings that are limited by various attributes. The attributes=\r\n decide the purpose of the being. If everybody fulfils their purpose, there=\r\n is some order in the system. Thus, your first answer is valid.\n\nHowever, a=\r\nll these beings are nothing but parts of Brahman, who have forgotten that t=\r\nhey are attribute-less Brahman and fancy themselves as objects with various=\r\n attributes.\n\nBased on the rules made by gods when Brahma was creating all =\r\nthese objects, we keep on accumulating karmas (actions, carried out due to =\r\nthe attributes) and keep on reaping the fruits of those karmas.\n\nThus, we k=\r\neep on moving from one set of attributes to another set, change from one bo=\r\ndy to another, serve one purpose after the other. This is a pontentially en=\r\ndless cycle.\n\nThe conditioning of the mind is weak in gods like Brahma, Vis=\r\nhnu, Shiva etc, who too are serving various purposes dictated by their attr=\r\nibutes, and they can meditate on their true nature for a small time and ful=\r\nly realize that they are just Brahman. We, on the other hand, change so man=\r\ny bodies and go through so many experiences that the conditioning of the mi=\r\nnd becomes so dense that it is difficult to realize the nature of true self=\r\n. The sense that &quot;I am this body and I am different from others&quot; is so stro=\r\nng. Still, it is possible to overcome the conditioning and realize the true=\r\n self.\n\nWhen a yogi reaches samadhi, it is possible to perceive that the en=\r\ntire world, including oneself, is just the attribute-less Brahman and that =\r\nthere are really no objects. In other words, it is possible for us to escap=\r\ne from the dreams/imaginations of Brahma. As as a part of Brahman is stuck =\r\nin our dreams as an object with specific attributes, we too are stuck in th=\r\ne thoughts of Brahma (creator) as objects with certain attributes. We can e=\r\nscape from that and realize our true nature.\n\nTo answer your question on wh=\r\ny Supreme Cosmic Being creates all this confusion, the supreme cosmic being=\r\n does not do or want or think anything. It is the limited manifestation cal=\r\nled Brahma (creator) that does this. He knows no better, because the attrib=\r\nutes he originally thought of for himself compel him to do so. However, he =\r\nleft the scope for all the objects fashioned by him to realize their true n=\r\nature.\n\nTo answer your question at a more practical level, this is what eac=\r\nh person can do: (1) Keep doing the duties that come to you naturally. (2) =\r\nAt a subtler level, question yourself who you actually are. Think &quot;am I thi=\r\ns body? Did I exist before this body existed? Will I exist when this body i=\r\ns given up?&quot; Cultivate detachment to the body and tell yourself that you ar=\r\ne the attribte-less Brahman.\n\nIf you do not understand all that I wrote, do=\r\n not worry. This is actually high level philosophy explained in simple term=\r\ns. It may be difficult for some to understand or appreciate.\n\nBest regards,=\r\n\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish =\r\nlessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006A_01C76985.2AF90C40\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16414&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear K=\r\nishore,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; Is there a purpose for life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \nNarasimha in his initial post wrote &quot;highest purpose (&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of =\r\nVedas) is \nself-knowledge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nIf I derive the \npoint that Vedas have a purpose so should living&lt;BR&gt;&gt; b=\r\neings.
