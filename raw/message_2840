Even after the saint leaves that\n&gt; place or leaves earth altog=\r\nether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it\n&gt; becomes weak and disappea=\r\nrs.\n&gt;\n&gt; In many famous temples these days, priests have become commercial a=\r\nnd do\n&gt; not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed every few years=\r\n to\n&gt; re-energize the idols\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; It is my humble opi=\r\nnion that some famous temples do not have much divine\n&gt; presence today, tho=\r\nugh I do not want to name any names. At the same time,\n&gt; some not-so-well-k=\r\nnown temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was very impres=\r\nsed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office\n&gt; is there), Gir=\r\nnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai\n&gt; (Ramana Maha=\r\nrshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy\n&gt; in those =\r\nplaces. There are several temples where the idol is practically\n&gt; alive. Fo=\r\nr example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the\n&gt; Kaali i=\r\ndol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at\n&gt; the=\r\n famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was one small =\r\ntemple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest\n&gt; who took me to visit=\r\n about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the\n&gt; Shata Chandi homa=\r\nm in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before\n&gt; and it seemed l=\r\nike a small temple. The name of the form of the divine\n&gt; Mother present the=\r\nre was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it.\n&gt; I do not even r=\r\nemember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started\n&gt; meditating w=\r\nith my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of\n&gt; a very f=\r\nierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that\n&gt; there was=\r\n a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the\n&gt; name of =\r\nthe place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the\n&gt; goddes=\r\ns. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof\n&gt; ca=\r\nme down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the\n&gt; go=\r\nddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a\n=\r\n&gt; hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu proba=\r\nbly\n&gt; knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt;\n&gt; Like this, I am sure th=\r\nere are many temples with a powerful divine presence\n&gt; across India.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ap=\r\nart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences\n&gt; wh=\r\nen meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am\n=\r\n&gt; sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamb=\r\ner\n&gt; there.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Even the middle of a busy road in I=\r\nndia is better for meditating than a\n&gt; temple in USA. These western countri=\r\nes are so filled with rajas and tamas.\n&gt; There is rajas in India too, but t=\r\nhere is a good amount of sattwa there.\n&gt; Thus, any temple in India will be =\r\na good place to meditate, but my view is\n&gt; that there is not much left at *=\r\nsome* temples. But some temples are really\n&gt; good.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one has a chance =\r\nto spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a\n&gt; temple, I suggest th=\r\ne following:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, K=\r\nurtaalam,\n&gt; Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tir=\r\nupati) in\n&gt; south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Jun=\r\nagadh) in\n&gt; west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India a=\r\nnd Srisailam\n&gt; and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are m=\r\nany other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a\n&gt; temple o=\r\nnce is one thing and staying there for several months while\n&gt; maintaining a=\r\n simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or\n&gt; japam) the=\r\nre is quite another.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comca=\r\nst.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;ht=\r\ntp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJ=\r\nagannath.org&lt;http://www.srijagannath.org/&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; *Fr=\r\nom:* Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; *Sent:* Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; *Subject:* [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Holy Places\n&gt;\n&gt;   Respected Narsimhaji,\n&gt; I would like to know your opin=\r\nion on holy places (famous temples etc) in\n&gt; today&#39;s time.

Thus, any=\r\n temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that ther=\r\ne is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If one has a chance to spend a few months doi=\r\nng spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;=\r\nArial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, =\r\nKurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam =\r\n(near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girn=\r\nar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh i=\r\nn north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central Indi=\r\na.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;There are many other good places, but t=\r\nhe above come to my mind.
