The initiation he got on the \n&gt; ba=\r\nnk \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has described =\r\nvery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. \n=\r\n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was=\r\n a \n&gt; fantastic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; orator.

This inner guru is=\r\n the same in all humam \n&gt; beings \n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manifests uniquely based on=\r\n each person. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also believe that one needs to get initiated =\r\nby a Guru who is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; present in physical form and seek guidance from him =\r\ntime to \ntime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many instances of other forms of inititation=\r\ns like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiation in dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these form=\r\ns \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiations though very important are very rare or uncommon.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up=\r\n \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind about him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) What was the purpose o=\r\nf his birth? Yes he may have guided \nmany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual aspirants, but th=\r\nere has to be something more unique.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Did he realize the ultimate? =\r\ni.e. he keeps mentioning in the \n&gt; &gt; book\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about it in many places? Wa=\r\ns he satisfied? How did he feel \nafter \n&gt; &gt; that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He did pass away=\r\n abruptly in bombay while in the middle of \n&gt; &gt; giving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirtual talks=\r\n? It seems unusual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have also read somewhere that once a per=\r\nson reaches a \nspiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for mo=\r\nre than few days, \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the case?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; May be othe=\r\nrs who have read this book can share more light.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do recommend to se=\r\nekers of spirutuality to read this book if \n&gt; one \n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, it i=\r\ns available for free to download as a pdf book on his \n&gt; &gt; web site.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment \nand\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown.

There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to \n&gt; &gt; Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nffice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Te=\r\nlephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as =\r\n\nMr. \n&gt; &gt; Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devote=\r\ne of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meet=\r\ning him he was always \n&gt; &gt; talking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We=\r\n came close day by day. There was a weekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhis home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs \n&gt; &gt; created \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkris=\r\nhna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this \n&gt; wee=\r\nkly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old=\r\n. Mr. Patel was \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashor=\r\ne daily at 7 pm after \n&gt; duty \n&gt; &gt; hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only ab=\r\nout Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told =\r\nme--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home =\r\nand my wife is remembering \n&gt; me. \n&gt; &gt; My \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come =\r\nin a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go \n&gt; &gt; now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a \n&gt; &gt; pla=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very muc=\r\nh impressed \n&gt; &gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events.=\r\n One day I had to go to Dwarka \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; Bus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told m=\r\ne not to go through bus, as bus tire will be \n&gt; punctured. \n&gt; &gt; Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nunctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all in=\r\ncidents made me to believe that he had some \n&gt; super \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was \n&gt; &gt; attracted to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple \nof \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nurrendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house=\r\n before Thakur picture. I \n&gt; &gt; prayed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my=\r\n heart to accept me as his follower and \nbestow \n&gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 \n&gt; &gt; mo=\r\nrning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I \n=\r\n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in th=\r\ne morning that I \n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Guru=\r\ndev. My wife was \n&gt; annoyed \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me =\r\na lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a \n&gt; &gt; hasty \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali =\r\nat \nCalcutta. \n&gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru sho=\r\nuld be living one, who can \nguide \n&gt; &gt; us, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantr=\r\na etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram \n&gt; Sharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arg=\r\numents were right at her place as people in \ngeneral \n&gt; &gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I \nhave \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=\r\n=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, \n&gt; &gt; Mr. Patel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never c=\r\nome to our home.
