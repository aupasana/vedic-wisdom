In future, I will move all my non-=\r\nastrological spiritual mails to this yahoogroup and stop posting on the ast=\r\nrology related lists. If you are interested, please subscribe to vedic-wisd=\r\nom yahoogroup.

I will not writ=\r\ne everyday, but only occasionally.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe following Vedi=\r\nc hymn is used at the beginning of several Vedic homas (fire rituals), when=\r\n the Fire god is welcome into the fire pit. It is verse 4.58.3 from RigVeda=\r\n and 12.10 from MahaNarayanopanishad. This text is in ITrans transliteratio=\r\nn.\n\ncatvAri shR^iMgAstrayo asya pAdA dve shIrShe saptahastAso asya |\ntridhA=\r\n baddho vR^iShabho roravIti maho devo martyAm Avivesha ||\n\nLiteral translat=\r\nion: &quot;He has 4 horns, 3 legs, 2 heads and 7 hands. This bull is tied 3-ways=\r\n and roars splendidly. This supreme god possesses all beings.&quot;\n\nObviously, =\r\nthis has to be interpreted figuratively and not literally. Here is my inter=\r\npretation:\n\nThis verse extols the role played by Agni, fire god. The Agni b=\r\nurns within us as the bhootaagni in the subtle body. It burns as jatharaagn=\r\ni and others in the gross body. It drives all our actions.\n\nShringa not onl=\r\ny means a horn, but also a summit or a pinnacle. Agni is the fire witin us =\r\nand is the basis for all our actions. The four purusharthas (purposes of th=\r\ne existence of a being - dharma, artha, kaama and moksha) that we fulfill t=\r\nhrough our actions are the four peaks of the Agni that provokes us to act. =\r\nThe crowns from the actions of Agni within us are these four purusharthas.\n=\r\n\nLegs are the basis on which one stands. They provide the foundation and ba=\r\nsis. The three gunas - sattva, rajas and tamas - are the basis for the Agni=\r\n within us. It stands on the basis of our gunas and provokes us to act. If =\r\nthe three gunas did not exist, the Agni within us could still exist as chid=\r\nagni (the existential fire), but it wouldn&#39;t move (chetana). The three guna=\r\ns are fundamental to the movement (chetana) of chidagni, which enables all =\r\nour actions. That is why this Agni within us that provokes us to act has 3 =\r\nlegs.\n\nSeersha not only means head, but also means the front portion or wha=\r\nt is seen. It basically refers to the identity, how one comes across. The t=\r\nwo fronts of this Agni that provokes all actions within us are Purusha and =\r\nPrakriti - the male and female energies. Surya and Chandra nadis (Pingala a=\r\nnd Ida) within the subtle body represent these two fronts of the Agni that =\r\nmakes us act. They represent actions in the gross body through the sympathe=\r\ntic nervous system and parasympathic nervous system, respectively. One is t=\r\nhe face of objective thinking and actions of an active nature, while the ot=\r\nher is the face of subjective thinking and actions of a passive nature. The=\r\n Agni that burns within us and makes us act results in various actions that=\r\n wear one of these two as the front/face.\n\nHands are the karmendriyas. It i=\r\ns with hands that we act in the world. They are the acting agents. The fire=\r\n that burns within us acts through the physical body and its tissues. The d=\r\nhaatvagnis (fires burning in the seven dhatus or tissues of the vital body)=\r\n are the seven hands of the master fire burning within us and making us act=\r\n. Through them, the fire carries out all its actions.\n\nThis fire of action =\r\nis tied with 3 ropes. The tridoshas of beings - kapha, pitta and vaata - ar=\r\ne the 3 ropes with which it is tied and its actions are restrained and also=\r\n kept in balance by these 3 ropes!\n\nThis fire within us roars like a bull a=\r\nnd is responsible for all our thoughts and actions. It is this fire that is=\r\n responsible for the actions of every being in this creation - from Brahma =\r\nto Vishnu to Shiva to you and I. This fire possesses all beings and make th=\r\nem act in this world.\n\nThus, this hymn eloquently describes the subtle natu=\r\nre of the bhootaagni that burns within us and that is responsible for all o=\r\nur actions. Though we invoke an external fire when performing homam, it is =\r\nsupposed to represent (and strengthen in the course of time) the internal f=\r\nire. No wonder a hymn giving this detailed and symbolic description of the =\r\ninternal fire is chanted when establishing the fire in the homa kundam!\n\nMa=\r\ny the light of Brahman shine within,\nNarasimha \n---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n \nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00B5_01C7515B.C8F98CE0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16414&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namast=\r\ne friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When I found a really nice muhurta a few=\r\n months \nback, I started a yahoogroup called &quot;vedic-wisdom&quot; to discuss the =\r\nhidden \nmeanings in Vedas, Upanishats, Puranas etc. I plan to occasionally =\r\npost my \nrandom thoughts on the list, mostly on spiritual/philosophical \nma=\r\ntters.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Please excuse me for posting this on astrolo=\r\ngy \nlists.
