When lot of his disciples were seen missing from the daily devotional =\r\nservices, Srila Bhakti Siddhantha Saraswati Thakur (Srila Prabhupada&#39;s Guru=\r\n Maharaj) found out that most of them were lying down in the noon. He asked=\r\n them to eat khichdi (grains are not allowed on ekadasi, still he insisted)=\r\n and go ahead with the daily devotional services. He told them it is essent=\r\nial to realize that fasting is important for devotional service, but it is =\r\nnot bigger than devotional service.\n\nregards\nPrasad\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;shankar789&quot; &lt;shankar789@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to do=\r\n fasting for sadhana purposes. I tried fasting on Ekadasi and could not sta=\r\nnd missing any meal. Since I failed on Ekadasi day, I attempted on Pradosha=\r\nm day and ended up eating at 1 am, since I was not able to sleep. Again I t=\r\nried on Full Moon day and ended up in failure. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thankful if any one of=\r\nfers tips for fasting.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
