Bhakti is singing, hearing and writing His name, d=\r\nrawing His picture, living with  people who talk about God. This will not o=\r\nnly make you free from tension and high blood pressure, it will make you im=\r\nmensely happy.&quot;\n\n&quot;Love, devotion, hatred, jealousy, fear, passion, sacrific=\r\ne and anger are feelings. You feel them; you do not see them. Similarly, yo=\r\nu cannot see God. God has to be felt. Feeling makes you like a child, it is=\r\n always pure. Childlike devotion is necessary for bhakti.&quot;\n\n&quot;Bhakti is the =\r\nonly sadhana path free of obstacles. Bhakti is inspired and sustained by Go=\r\nd. It is attained only by the grace of God. It is His prasad. You come to b=\r\nhakti by God&#39;s blessing. You love Him, you become attached to him only when=\r\n and as He wishes. Therefore, when bhakti is His gift, His wish, how can th=\r\nere be an obstacle? &quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
