I used to remember god 24 hors a day. But in 199=\r\n0 I started fearing god and now I hate him so much so that I destroyed my h=\r\nome made temple and his posters. why i did so the reason is as below:\n&gt; I a=\r\nm suffering from ocd (Obsessive compulsive disorder) since 1990. My problem=\r\n is that whenever I am doing some work some part of my mind says that if th=\r\nis work gets done I will go to temple but it is not me and I counter this t=\r\nhought by saying that I will not go to temple. But at the completion of the=\r\n work I am compelled to go to temple. The problem is that I have to go to t=\r\nemple compulsively and many times again and again. Also the temple which co=\r\nmes to my thoughts has to be visited to satisfy my compulsion. Even a simpl=\r\ne thought that if my son answers the question I will go to temple. I am not=\r\n even able to teach him. I cant cross the road where there is a temple. How=\r\n can I avoid that. There are temples all around the world. Please help me o=\r\nut. For past 10 yrs I am taking allopathy medicine. For past 7 months I am =\r\ntaking homeopathy also. But sometimes it goes out of control. Please guide =\r\nme how can I stop hating GOD. \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Dob :16th april,1975\n&gt; Place:=\r\n  kangra (Himachal Pradesh)\n&gt; Time : 8 pm\n&gt; \n&gt; a\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
