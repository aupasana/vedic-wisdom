Someone sent me a few snipp=\r\nets from an \ninterview posted on her website. Please see below.\n\nIt is inte=\r\nresting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It \nis inte=\r\nresting that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and \nshow =\r\nwhat is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This \nis s=\r\nimilar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to \nhim =\r\nduring Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n\nShe told him that many people are an=\r\nd will be born who will perform a short \nfire ritual on a regular basis, es=\r\ntablish sanatana dharma and peace in the \nworld and also make quick spiritu=\r\nal progress individually in that process. \nShree Maa&#39;s statement about what=\r\n Ramakrishna told her is along similar \nlines.\n\nMy guru was also told by Mo=\r\nther that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \nshould be established arou=\r\nnd the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a \nday. These places do no=\r\nt need to be near any temples or famous places and \ncan be anywhere. The ri=\r\ntual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no \nneed to offer silk sa=\r\nrees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum \nofferings is enough, b=\r\nut it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a \nfew such centres are =\r\nestablished, it will apparently lead to a chain of \nevents that will help r=\r\ne-establish sanatana dharma.\n\nThough not 3 times a day, these people have d=\r\none a Chandi homam everyday for \n3 years in the same place and finished 100=\r\n0 such homas. That is fantastic! \nIt is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas =\r\nthat creates energy and brings \ndeities to a place. While several ancient t=\r\nemples are without any divine \npresence these days, new places of divine pr=\r\nesence may be created by pure \nsouls engaged in selfless sadhana for establ=\r\nishing dharma in the world.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Sh=\r\nata Chandi homam during which \nMother appeared and gave instructions to my =\r\nguru on spreading homam was \ntaken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and =\r\nthe time of sankalpa was within \na few minutes from the actual Tithi Praves=\r\nha time of the birth anniversary. \nAll of this was a coincidence and we wer=\r\ne unaware of this significance when \nwe decided the muhurta. It is interest=\r\ning to know that Ramakrishna did \nmention fire ceremonies specifically to s=\r\nomebody and that his words are \nsimilar to the words of Mother.\n\nBest regar=\r\nds,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ - \n\n&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; Master, has a small as=\r\nhram here near the Bay Area\n&gt;\n&gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snip=\r\npets from her website\n&gt; pasted for your benefit), from an interview found h=\r\nere\n&gt; http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Sh=\r\nree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go now for\n&gt; our c=\r\nountry, and all other country, you have to go do fire ceremonies\n&gt; and show=\r\n what is truth, what is dignity, and at that time the whole\n&gt; world will be=\r\n peace.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of =\r\nAmerican descent),\n&gt; that same page describes his background, how he met he=\r\nr and all that;\n&gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;At=\r\n a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at best,\n&gt; he ha=\r\nd traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he studied\n&gt; with a n=\r\number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi and\n&gt; the sacred fi=\r\nre ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of worship\n&gt; and meditation, =\r\nwhile undertaking great austerities in the process.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They under=\r\ntook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremony\n&gt; and worship of =\r\nthe Goddess, without setting foot outside from the\n&gt; humble temple grounds =\r\nthey established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     =\r\n Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
