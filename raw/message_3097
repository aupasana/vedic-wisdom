The real faith also =\r\nneeds to be earned after a lot of struggle.\n \nSwami Vivekananda has said in=\r\n one of his works which means that in every sect, immature Bhaktas are the =\r\nreal recruit which can be easily molded in to the fanaticism.\n\nI know one s=\r\nuch Fanatic. He said that so and so person was saved in the Mumbai Train Bl=\r\nast even when he was in the same train because he was a devotee of Art of L=\r\niving. The others died......\n\nI know another fanatic who says that Krishna =\r\nis the only supreme God and if somebody is praying to Shiva, he is ignorant=\r\n and fool. He must pray directly to the supreme God and not the lesser Gods=\r\n.....\n\nAnother class of Fanatics believes in total that all the others who =\r\ndon&#39;t believe in Islam will go to hell....and same class in another faith b=\r\nelieves that Jesus is the ONLY savior. \n\nAnd the Joke is that they are all =\r\nso called Faithful (Actually it&#39;s an abuse to the real meaning of Faith).\n\n=\r\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n \n\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chaudhuri.=\r\nkrishnendu&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; \n&gt; These are my p=\r\nersonal views and they maybe wrong and egoistic so i appeal of forgiveness =\r\nbefore:\n&gt; \n&gt; If you think your GURU to be GOD know that for sure that HE IS=\r\n GOD\n&gt; and let not the view of the world shake your faith.\n&gt; One more thing=\r\n friend spirituality is not a subject of debate or discussion but OF REALIS=\r\nATION as i feel.\n&gt; You have taken your GURU or i think we take our GURU as =\r\na ladder to reach GOD&#39;S house.When you are climbing never look down to what=\r\n others are saying.If you want to hear and see from someone let that be ONL=\r\nY and ONLY your GURU.Either you will reach hell or you will reach heaven.Bu=\r\nt you will reach somewhere and will not be stranded with those persons shou=\r\nting below.\n&gt; Wishing all the luck in your spiritual journey and may Lord S=\r\nhiva guide you through.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pa=\r\nthak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&#39;s views =\r\nare to Fight/debate/disagree/question without PASSION. so this is an apt th=\r\nread to do some progress in that attitude.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am sorry if you feel =\r\nsad or insulting when Sri Sri is criticized but understand that So many mil=\r\nlions of Hindus would have felt the same feeling in that debate. I personal=\r\nly admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel and have placed them to=\r\n the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one for whom i have same lov=\r\ne and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Narasimha. Why? B=\r\necause all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud not only by effe=\r\nctively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY OPERATED IN T=\r\nHE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATTACHED TO THE=\r\nM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of Sanatan Dharma=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about him initi=\r\nally. a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i switched on TV =\r\nwhere in i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of=\r\n a gathering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go through.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his lectu=\r\nre. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christianity=\r\n for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sanskaa=\r\nr&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus)  =\r\ncome for discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in they have =\r\nattacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of Sanat=\r\nan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.\n&gt; &gt; after that first lecture,=\r\n i watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced that this person is not=\r\n a true spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a f=\r\nanatic and then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debat=\r\ne at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debat=\r\ned on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking =\r\nhim that does he really believe that other religions and faith are also tru=\r\ne. I must say that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more tolera=\r\nnce and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; The unfortunate part is that =\r\nthe broad minded people of today&#39;s generations are getting corrupted by suc=\r\nh fanatic leaders.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Friend=\r\ns (Really good friends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -&quot;The =\r\ntime has come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious faiths bu=\r\nt also we must belive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is t=\r\nrue and we must never try to convert people of other religion to our religi=\r\non but on the contrary we must discourage a person who wants to formally co=\r\nnvert by telling him/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to such =\r\ntheatrics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are pat=\r\nhs, as many opinion are there&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i=\r\n believe him as a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which =\r\nmakes me believe that. Now that is the reason i wish to know his views on t=\r\nhis particular debate episode. I know he has a great knowledge and he also =\r\nis a scholar but then why he did not counter Dr. Zakir?. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Siva wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silver jubilee with over 2 million people me=\r\nditating and doing Sudarshan Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006.

The actions of an englightened master established in =\r\nSahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things s=\r\nhould be. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the h=\r\nighest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura=\r\n instead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh.

Can we give a sati=\r\nsfying intellectual answer to it if people raise questions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: I=\r\nf Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in =\r\nitself!

I read it long ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anoth=\r\ner instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Mahar=\r\nishi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with e=\r\nquanimity.

Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be expla=\r\nined logically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The bea=\r\nuty about an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot =\r\ncontain them in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that i=\r\ns much higher.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the Mother would say if something is beyond =\r\nour mental understanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I fee=\r\nl I have said everything I had to say. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In hind sight, I reali=\r\nze that I should not have ventured to give an intellectual explanation for =\r\nsomething that I myself have not yet intellectually understood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what =\r\ndo say or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledge o=\r\nr understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri Kri=\r\nshna might judge him differently for several of His acts which could not be=\r\n intellectually explained.

In fact, this is a question that was raised by discip=\r\nles of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if one looks into it=\r\n, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has co=\r\nmmented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an authority on vedanta =\r\nboth by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the Bhagavad Gita w=\r\nhen he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and who gives imprompt=\r\nu discourses in various forums across the world on all topics under the sun=\r\n shy away from explaining some simple questions that are about his home tur=\r\nf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never=\r\n debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can s=\r\nhow the way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not inte=\r\nrested in anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity in the hea=\r\nrt of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and let it p=\r\nass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the questions that were raise=\r\nd in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various comme=\r\nntaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may ask why then di=\r\nd he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was so=\r\nmething like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did just=\r\nice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was suppos=\r\nedly the topic of discussion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from=\r\n the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest =\r\nto everyone, especially those among us that are intellectually curious abou=\r\nt spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always pra=\r\nctices &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. So=\r\nmetimes in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and S=\r\nri Sri will only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laug=\r\nhs, but his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that =\r\nare receptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people tra=\r\nding one mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening=\r\n up to Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happ=\r\nen. Words are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point =\r\nof words is to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not crea=\r\nted, there is no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great priv=\r\nilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whet=\r\nher it is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them f=\r\nrom our Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are inn=\r\numerable examples of very simple people benefiting from his mere looks & pr=\r\nesence while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportuni=\r\nty of a lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakr=\r\nishna would feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate!=\r\n What a disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ra=\r\nmakrishna as an illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without an a=\r\nccompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an e=\r\nxperience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will become y=\r\net another mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. S=\r\nome of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by=\r\n none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Thing=\r\ns like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that wa=\r\ny less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasional=\r\nly visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the bel=\r\now email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritu=\r\nal practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want t=\r\no clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of Sat-=\r\nChit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion,=\r\n etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does no=\r\nt make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo wou=\r\nld call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerg=\r\ne into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly a=\r\nnd the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yo=\r\nga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not=\r\n just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pra=\r\nnayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind =\r\nand preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of contemp=\r\nlation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice o=\r\nf Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana =\r\nsequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar=\r\n) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudar=\r\nshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, ad=\r\nvance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of=\r\n Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat =\r\nGita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the=\r\n above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publ=\r\nicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! =\r\nBesides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended.=\r\n Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that stri=\r\nve to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path =\r\nof AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama =\r\nsankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some won=\r\nder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; L=\r\net me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fu=\r\nlly Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of =\r\nguiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to=\r\n be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself=\r\n had that experience twice), some in person and several via various other w=\r\nays. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is=\r\n essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate =\r\nand in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to guid=\r\ne disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be est=\r\nablished.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (=\r\nmostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order capable of reachin=\r\ng SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. They may be not fu=\r\nlly established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru and =\r\ncan appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achieve=\r\nd highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Ma=\r\nharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are in phys=\r\nical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for it=\r\ns courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL t=\r\neachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the =\r\nproceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of t=\r\nhe full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions wor=\r\nth in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar n=\r\neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have =\r\nwent through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the =\r\nKnowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to=\r\n be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seni=\r\nor AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help =\r\nor guidance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kas=\r\nhmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and D=\r\nivine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, mo=\r\nney is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n 1) Past experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem to fol=\r\nlow the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deservi=\r\nng person should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a=\r\n volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know first han=\r\nd many cases where people took courses for free and were also provided free=\r\n accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go the=\r\nre paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and pr=\r\novide healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of i=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl pos=\r\nition. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who st=\r\nill may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, S=\r\nri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express the =\r\nlove, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a =\r\npath, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
