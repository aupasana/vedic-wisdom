But the fullness of the supramental change is not possible, i=\r\nf the body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, pain, uncons=\r\nciousness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are to remain th=\r\ne descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change of consciou=\r\nsness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine, the Overmi=\r\nnd is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supramental Desce=\r\nnt is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vital and body=\r\n. This would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disappearence of the unconsci=\r\nousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or disease. Tha=\r\nt would mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by which death c=\r\nomes. If a change in the body had to be made, it would be by the will of th=\r\ne inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical\n immortality. If someon=\r\ne wanted to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had the complete si=\r\nddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be no immortality of the body w=\r\nithout supramentalization. &quot;\n=C2=A0\nAgain at another place Sri Aurobindo st=\r\nates that immoratlity is not the aim of Supramental Descent, but one of the=\r\n possibilities.\n=C2=A0\nI did not quite understand, what exactly is this Sup=\r\nramental Descent, if it has nothing to do with physical immortality.Because=\r\n, connecting the and uplifting the ordinary mind to the state of divinity a=\r\nnd functioning from that sphere is something that most self realized Yogis =\r\ndo. Then how is &quot;Supramental Descent&quot; so unique?\n=C2=A0\nAgain if, as we see=\r\n from the above writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken of=\r\nf, that would mean also a transformation of the body. \n=C2=A0\nWell, the Nat=\r\nhs(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane. Is t=\r\nhat what Supramental Descent is?\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\nRama Naa=\r\nma Satya Hai..\n\n--- On Sat, 23/1/10, schinnas &lt;schinnas@...&gt; wrote:\n\n=\r\n\nFrom: schinnas &lt;schinnas@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Part 1- Th=\r\ne Recollections of Ramana Maharshi Devotee N.

It is surprising to see that af=\r\nter being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo&#39;s teachings with physical=\r\n immortality.\n\nIt is also factually incorrect that disciples of Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo and Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Balaram Reddy see=\r\nms to confuse his imaginations for facts.\n\nThere were several instances whe=\r\nn Mother and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away to Ramanashram saying =\r\nthey are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi than the Integral Yog=\r\na. I know of atleast one case (there could be several) where Ramana Maharis=\r\nhi sent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were meant for the path o=\r\nf Integral Yoga. \n\nIt is very possible that Ramana Maharishi might have sai=\r\nd something specific to Balaram Reddy to help him come out of his guilt con=\r\nsciousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram without full consent of his =\r\nGuru. We need to take Balaram Reddy&#39;s recollections and opinions (especiall=\r\ny his assumptions and interpolations) with a big pinch of salt. \n\n-Shiva.\n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@ .=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In 1931, after reading about Sri Aurobindo, and also hearing=\r\n about him from\n&gt; others, I made my way to his ashrama in Pondicherry. Imme=\r\ndiately upon my\n&gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the p=\r\nlace. On August\n&gt; 15th of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobind=\r\no. This was one of\n&gt; three times in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo and Mother\n&gt; to be powerful spiritual personalities, as they se=\r\nemed to have the ability\n&gt; to work on the development of their disciples in=\r\n a silent and invisible\n&gt; manner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings=\r\n cannot convey his or the\n&gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhile I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; disci=\r\nple of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then\n&gt; visiting =\r\nSri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; ashrama. H=\r\nis intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.\n&gt; Narasimhaswam=\r\ni&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit\n&gt; to Ramana=\r\nsramam in 1933.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before this second visit to Ramanasramam I once again =\r\nread Bhagavan&#39;s\n&gt; biography. In it I found a passage relating to the possib=\r\nility of changing\n&gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it t=\r\no the Maharshi. He\n&gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. Wha=\r\nt of that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, wa=\r\ns regulated and\n&gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into=\r\n town we had to\n&gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it w=\r\nas totally\n&gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, info=\r\nrmality and\n&gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the same time e=\r\nlevating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally permitt=\r\ned to visit all\n&gt; other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Maha=\r\nrshi and Sri\n&gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the powe=\r\nr to undo years\n&gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo we=\r\nre effecting on the\n&gt; psyche of their followers. In other words, they consi=\r\ndered the Maharshi too\n&gt; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was aware of this =\r\nand once when I was alone\n&gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place=\r\n. They are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram\n&gt; \n&gt; I had been wit=\r\nh the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years\n&gt; they shower=\r\ned me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the spiritual\n&gt; path. My =\r\ngratitude and regard for them compelled me to obtain their\n&gt; permission and=\r\n blessings before leaving. This turned out to be much more\n&gt; difficult than=\r\n I imagined.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples=\r\n who had doubts or\n&gt; questions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri=\r\n Aurobindo. All the\n&gt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, =\r\nwho would sit with the\n&gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them =\r\nin writing. Sometimes we\n&gt; would see the lights burning all night as they w=\r\nere engaged in this work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote a l=\r\netter stating my desire to\n&gt; receive their blessings and permission to live=\r\n at Ramanasramam. In the\n&gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that since your yoga=\r\n begins with\n&gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me to go to Ramana Maharshi =\r\nwho emphasizes\n&gt; only Self-realization, a state I have not attained, or may=\r\n not even be\n&gt; worthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but=\r\n negative in\n&gt; regards to my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-reali=\r\nzation and the\n&gt; supra-mental state can be simultaneously developed and ach=\r\nieved here. There\n&gt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was extremely d=\r\nisappointed at his response and consequently became\n&gt; frustrated, restless =\r\nand discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights\n&gt; and felt distraugh=\r\nt. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same\n&gt; request. Again=\r\n I was denied permission. It took a long five months and a\n&gt; third letter b=\r\nefore Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their\n&gt; permission=\r\n and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and\n&gt; they saw=\r\n no other recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final lette=\r\nr to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\n&gt; follow a path in which you=\r\n can achieve only partial realization, we give you\n&gt; our blessings, though =\r\nwe believe it would be better if you stayed on here\n&gt; and pursued your sadh=\r\nana where both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was the rule in Auro=\r\nbindo Ashram that any letter written to or received\n&gt; from Aurobindo should=\r\n not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this\n&gt; rule, I burnt all=\r\n my letters, except the final letter I received from\n&gt; Aurobindo. This I ke=\r\npt with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Settling at Sri Ramanasram=\r\nam\n&gt; \n&gt; During the early years there were no houses anywhere near the ashra=\r\nm, as it\n&gt; was mostly jungle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room=\r\n in a\n&gt; brahmin&#39;s house near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I =\r\nwould\n&gt; sometimes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from s=\r\nomewhere\n&gt; outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the\n&gt;=\r\n hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again to th=\r\ne\n&gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on like this durin=\r\ng the\n&gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close to Bhagavan so I =\r\ncould\n&gt; hear all of his precious utterances.\n&gt; \n&gt; S. S. Cohen, after repeat=\r\nedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the\n&gt; Yogi from Pondicherry =\r\nmust have some greatness. Consequently, one day he\n&gt; travelled to Pondicher=\r\nry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\n&gt; describing who he was, what =\r\nhe wanted from life (Self-realization) and where\n&gt; he was then residing (Sr=\r\ni Ramanasramam) . Cohen later showed me the reply he\n&gt; got from Aurobindo. =\r\nIt said, in brief, that all his aspirations could be\n&gt; fulfilled at Sri Ram=\r\nanasramam, where he was then living.\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember during my second visit=\r\n to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day\n&gt; reading a lengthy book review f=\r\nrom a newspaper. The book being reviewed was\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. =\r\nThe reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of\n&gt; this newspaper was Bhaga=\r\nvan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take\n&gt; great interest in th=\r\ne review and would occasionally stop reading and comment\n&gt; on what he had j=\r\nust read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded\n&gt; reading it, s=\r\nomeone who was aware that I had that very book with me, said to\n&gt; Bhagavan,=\r\n &quot;This man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book\n&gt; with h=\r\nim.&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\n&gt; look =\r\nat it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over to=\r\n Bhagavan.\n&gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He kept on rea=\r\nding it well\n&gt; into the night, with the help of a small oil lamp, until he =\r\nfinished it.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I came into the hall the next day he began discussin=\r\ng the book with me,\n&gt; telling me that a certain term used in the book might=\r\n look like something\n&gt; new, but it is actually the equivalent of this other=\r\n term used in such and\n&gt; such ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on disc=\r\nussing and comparing\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan tho=\r\nroughly understood\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also fr=\r\nom the standpoint of\n&gt; experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan that=\r\n the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; teachings is that it professes that =\r\nimmortality of the body can be achieved.\n&gt; Bhagavan made no comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat down, Bhagavan\n&gt; loo=\r\nked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam there was one yogi, C. V. V.\n&gt; =\r\nRao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of the immortality of the\n&gt; b=\r\nody. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a\n&gt; distingui=\r\nshed public and spiritual personality in India) would have to come\n&gt; to him=\r\n to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he had a chance\n&gt; to m=\r\neet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illustrated his\n&gt; =\r\npoint.\n&gt; \n&gt; On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ramanasram=\r\nam, I\n&gt; approached Bhagavan when no one was in the hall and showed him that=\r\n last\n&gt; letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to give it =\r\nto him to\n&gt; read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s han=\r\ndwriting, as\n&gt; it was very illegible and only those who have studied it for=\r\n sometime could\n&gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After=\r\n looking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he\n&gt; ret=\r\nurned it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came\n&gt; =\r\nto the sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which you ca=\r\nn\n&gt; achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it =\r\nis\n&gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This was the final blow that sil=\r\nenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this\n&gt; letter, like all the rest. And=\r\n because of all the discussions I had had with\n&gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfe=\r\nctly established in his teachings, having a clear\n&gt; understanding of where =\r\nthe Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\n&gt; went different ways=\r\n. When all the clouds of doubts and distractions\n&gt; dispersed, so did our di=\r\nscussions. Bhagavan then knew that I understood and\n&gt; the foundation work h=\r\nad been done. The purpose of all our discussions were\n&gt; served and so they =\r\nstopped automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bha=\r\ngavan was the power of his\n&gt; presence.

But the fullness of the supramental change is not possibl=\r\ne, if the body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, pain, un=\r\nconsciousness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are to remai=\r\nn the descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change of cons=\r\nciousness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine, the Ov=\r\nermind is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supramental D=\r\nescent is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vital and =\r\nbody. This would imply as&nbsp;a final result the disappearence of the unco=\r\nnsciousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or disease.=\r\n That would mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by which dea=\r\nth comes. If a change in the body had to be made, it would be by the will o=\r\nf the inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical\n immortality. If so=\r\nmeone wanted to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had the complet=\r\ne siddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be no immortality of the bo=\r\ndy without supramentalization. &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Again at anot=\r\nher place Sri Aurobindo states that immoratlity is not the aim of Suprament=\r\nal Descent, but one of the possibilities.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I di=\r\nd not quite understand, what exactly is this Supramental Descent, if it has=\r\n nothing to do with physical immortality.Because, connecting the and uplift=\r\ning the ordinary mind to the state of divinity and functioning from that sp=\r\nhere is something that most self realized Yogis do. Then how is &quot;Supramenta=\r\nl Descent&quot; so unique?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Again if, as we see from=\r\n the above writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken off, th=\r\nat would mean also a transformation of the body. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Well, the Naths(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in=\r\n this plane.

It is surprising to se=\r\ne that after being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo&#39;s teachings with=\r\n physical immortality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is also factually incorrect that disciples=\r\n of Sri Aurobindo and Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Ba=\r\nlaram Reddy seems to confuse his imaginations for facts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There were =\r\nseveral instances when Mother and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away t=\r\no Ramanashram saying they are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi =\r\nthan the Integral Yoga. I know of atleast one case (there could be several)=\r\n where Ramana Maharishi sent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were=\r\n meant for the path of Integral Yoga. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is very possible that Rama=\r\nna Maharishi might have said something specific to Balaram Reddy to\n help h=\r\nim come out of his guilt consciousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram =\r\nwithout full consent of his Guru.

Immediately upon my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual =\r\natmosphere of the place. On August&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 15th of that year, I had my firs=\r\nt darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; three times in a year t=\r\nhat he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be\n powerf=\r\nul spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to w=\r\nork on the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n manner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his or the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; While I =\r\nwas in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; discip=\r\nle of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; visi=\r\nting Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n ashrama. His intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Narasimhaswami&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first =\r\nvisit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to Ramanasramam in 1933.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before this second =\r\nvisit to Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagavan&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; biography. In it=\r\n I found a passage relating to the possibility of changing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s gu=\r\nru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it to the\n Maharshi. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ntold me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What of that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulat=\r\ned and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into to=\r\nwn we had to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam i=\r\nt was totally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of free=\r\ndom, informality and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at =\r\nthe same time elevating.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disci=\r\nples were generally permitted to visit all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other saints and ashrama=\r\ns, with the exception of the Maharshi and Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramanasramam. It was =\r\nbelieved that the Maharshi had the power to undo years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of spiritual=\r\n preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo were effecting on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ps=\r\nyche of their followers. In other words, they considered the Maharshi too&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was\n aware of this and once when I w=\r\nas alone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. They are =\r\nafraid of me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I=\r\n had been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; they showered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the sp=\r\niritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; path. My gratitude and regard for them compelled me to obta=\r\nin their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; permission and blessings before leaving. This turned out t=\r\no be much more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; difficult than I imagined.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In Aurob=\r\nindo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n questions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit =\r\nwith the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writi=\r\nng. Sometimes we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; would see the lights burning all night as they wer=\r\ne engaged in this work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam =\r\nI wrote a letter stating my desire to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; receive their blessings and p=\r\nermission to live at Ramanasramam. In the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; letter to Aurobindo I wro=\r\nte that since your yoga begins with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Self-realization, kindly permit=\r\n me to go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only Self-realization, =\r\na state I have not attained, or may not even be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; worthy of attaining=\r\n. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but negative in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards to my=\r\n leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-realization and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; supra=\r\n-mental state can be simultaneously developed and achieved here. There&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was extremely disap=\r\npointed at his response and consequently became&lt;BR&gt;&gt; frustrated, restles=\r\ns and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and felt d=\r\nistraught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nrequest. Again I was\n denied permission. It took a long five months and a&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; third letter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving =\r\nme their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; permission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was dete=\r\nrmined to go and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; they saw no other recourse but to grant my request=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final letter to me he wrote, &quot;Since you a=\r\nre determined to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; follow a path in which you can achieve only partia=\r\nl realization, we give you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our blessings, though we believe it woul=\r\nd be better if you stayed on here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and pursued your sadhana where bo=\r\nth the Mother and I can help you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It was the rule in Auro=\r\nbindo Ashram that any letter written to or received&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from Aurobindo =\r\nshould not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rule,=\r\n I burnt all my letters, except the final letter I received from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Au=\r\nrobindo. This I kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Settling\n at Sri Ramanasramam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; During the early years t=\r\nhere were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was mostly jung=\r\nle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; brahmin&#39;s ho=\r\nuse near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someti=\r\nmes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back a=\r\ngain to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on=\r\n like this during the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit c=\r\nlose to Bhagavan so I could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hear all of his precious utterances.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; S. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, d=\r\necided that the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness.\n Co=\r\nnsequently, one day he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; travelled to Pondicherry and while there wro=\r\nte a note to Aurobindo&lt;BR&gt;&gt; describing who he was, what he wanted from l=\r\nife (Self-realization) and where&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he was then residing (Sri Ramanasr=\r\namam) . Cohen later showed me the reply he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; got from Aurobindo. It s=\r\naid, in brief, that all his aspirations could be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fulfilled at Sri R=\r\namanasramam, where he was then living.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I remember during m=\r\ny second visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reading a l=\r\nengthy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Au=\r\nrobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seeme=\r\nd to take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; great interest in the review and would occasionally stop =\r\nreading and comment&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on what he had just read to those sitting aroun=\r\nd him. When he had concluded&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reading it, someone who was\n aware tha=\r\nt I had that very book with me, said to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhagavan, &quot;This man has com=\r\ne from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with him.&quot; Bhagava=\r\nn turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; look at it.=\r\n&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it o=\r\nver to Bhagavan.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He=\r\n kept on reading it well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; into the night, with the help of a small o=\r\nil lamp, until he finished it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I came into the hall t=\r\nhe next day he began discussing the book with me,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; telling me that a=\r\n certain term used in the book might look like something&lt;BR&gt;&gt; new, but i=\r\nt is actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; su=\r\nch ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also\n from the standpo=\r\nint of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan =\r\nthat the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; teachings is that it profe=\r\nsses that immortality of the body can be achieved.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhagavan made no=\r\n comment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall =\r\nand sat down, Bhagavan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakon=\r\nam there was one yogi, C. V. V.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all, hi=\r\ns doctrine of the immortality of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; body. He was even so bold as t=\r\no declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; distinguished public and spiritu=\r\nal personality in India) would have to come&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to him to learn how to =\r\nmake her body immortal. But, before he had a chance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to meet Dr. Ann=\r\nie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illustrated his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; point=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ram=\r\nanasramam, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; approached Bhagavan when no\n one was in the hall and s=\r\nhowed him that last&lt;BR&gt;&gt; letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan =\r\nasked me to give it to him to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; read. I told him he would be unable t=\r\no decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwriting, as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it was very illegible and on=\r\nly those who have studied it for sometime could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; read it. He said, &quot;=\r\nGive it to me. Let me try.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; After looking into it and real=\r\nizing he could only make out a few words, he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; returned it and asked =\r\nme to read it out. I began reading it and when I came&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the senten=\r\nce, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ach=\r\nieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it i=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This was the fi=\r\nnal blow that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; letter,=\r\n like all the rest. And because of all the\n discussions I had had with&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, having a c=\r\nlear&lt;BR&gt;&gt; understanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s pat=\r\nh diverged and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts a=\r\nnd distractions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then kn=\r\new that I understood and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the foundation work had been done. The pur=\r\npose of all our discussions were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; served and so they stopped automat=\r\nically.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagav=\r\nan was the power of his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; presence. Much of what he taught had alread=\r\ny been transmitted to the masses&lt;BR&gt;&gt; down through the ages. In Bhagavan=\r\n we found a being that was surcharged with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Reality to such an e=\r\nxtent that coming into his presence would effect a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dramatic change =\r\nin us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sources:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a) &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmay-jun&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmay-jun&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n b) &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmar-apr&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/?=\r\n pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; c) &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newslette=\r\nrs/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.arunacha l=\r\na.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-aug&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=91&quot;=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=92 =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B8=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=\r\n=BE=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9B =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BD=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=A7=D1=80=\r\n=E2=96=91=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=97 =D1=80=E2=96=\r\n=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=\r\n=90 =D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B3=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BF&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BA=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96=91=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=92=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=\r\n=9D =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=AC=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=93=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=95=\r\n=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=92=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=\r\n=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=92&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96=\r\n=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=97=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BE=\r\n=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=97 =D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=9B=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=91&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1=\r\n&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nYour Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8. &lt;a href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_ie8_new/*http://downloads.yahoo.com/in/intern=\r\netexplorer/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get it NOW!&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n--0-1002060830-1264230364=:66626--\r\n\n"}}
