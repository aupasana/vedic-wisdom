I ness and At=\r\ntachment are the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Chandika attacks Shumbha he becomes uncons=\r\ncious. at that time Nishumbha attacks her. It indicates that the final war =\r\nfor realisation is with our Ahamkaar & Aasakti (I ness & Attachment -me, my=\r\n, mine). it may seem that Ahamkaar is dead but it can be a deception. it ma=\r\ny have been hiding (like Shumbha became unconsious for some time). Aasakti =\r\n(Nishumbha) is ready to attack even if I ness is temporarily sleeping.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n When mother completely destroys Nishumbha (Aasakti), Shumbha is furious an=\r\nd even challenges the mother with the abuses such as Dushte, Anyasa Balamaa=\r\nshrita. he is furious because he lost his brother which is like a soul mate=\r\n. Inseparable. once aasakti is finished, Ahamkaar becomes weaker and then m=\r\nother finally mounts concluding attack on the demon Shumbha to finally libe=\r\nrate the soul. \n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; Raktabeeja -&gt; Vaasanaas (Desires, mental conditi=\r\noning)\n&gt; \n&gt; Raktabeeja is veru dangerous and powerful. He has a capacity to=\r\n multiply and multiply and feel the entire universe. Our desires are also l=\r\nike that. they multiply in no time. they are never finshes even if we satis=\r\nfy them. they keep increasing and multiplying.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most powerful demon=\r\n after Shumbha & Nishumbha is Raktabeeja. it is so powerful that all the va=\r\nrious forms of mothers (such as Indriyaani, Naarasimhi, Vaaraahi, Maaheshwa=\r\nri, Brahmaani) attack him simultaneously but still he is not finished. The =\r\nmultiplication ability of his, ceates danger for the whole world and Devas =\r\nbecomes worried (like Good virutes feel scared of danger from endless desir=\r\nes, like saintly people are always at danger from onslaught of materialisti=\r\nc and wicked people).\n&gt; \n&gt; seeing that Devas are really worried, Chandika a=\r\nnd Chaamunda both attack him and destroy him. Chaamunda (Kali) actually suc=\r\nks the blood of the demon and destroys all the multiplied demons instantly =\r\nto the point that Raktabeeja becomes bloodless and then detroyed completely=\r\n. Hence Kaali has capacity to destroy all the vaasanaas and the beeja of va=\r\nasanaas.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; Chanda and Munda are like Greed & Appeasement. they bot=\r\nh fan the Ego (Shumbha). they lure him to go for possesing everything in th=\r\ne world.\n&gt; They successfully trigger Ahamkaar and propell us to go for the =\r\nwrong things/desires/ possession.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; DhumraLochan -&gt; Krodha (Anger/fur=\r\ny which is unmindful but very weak)\n&gt; \n&gt; Dhumralochan (Krodha) is aggressiv=\r\ne but has feet of clay, that is why Durga destroys Dhumralochan with just a=\r\ns &#39;Hunkaar&#39; (just by a word &#39;Hum&#39;) and the chapter no.6 is over in few vers=\r\nes.\n&gt; ****\n&gt; \n&gt; confused! not your fault. i couldn&#39;t explain it properly :)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. co=\r\nm, rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@ ....&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would be happy if you could explain and elaborate about armies o=\r\nf shumbh and vishumbha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; rajesh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sa=\r\nt, 7/3/09, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: utpal pat=\r\nhak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Reason to Smile for=\r\n Sanatan Dharma !!!\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Saturd=\r\nay, 7 March, 2009, 12:41 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Mitesh,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These are good information=\r\ns which gives us lot of hopes for future of Dharma in general and Sanatan D=\r\nharma in perticular.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let us also join in doing Sadhana a=\r\ns per our best of capabilities and try to reduce our Ahamkaar by each passi=\r\nng month. let us get over our little minds and start hearing call of Big mi=\r\nnd, which will help us individually & collectively, to overcome negativity =\r\nsuch as unnecessary fights of words, pride of everything, anger, selfishnes=\r\ns, haughtyness, endless desires, greedy ness and all the other armies of Sh=\r\numbh and Nishumbha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utp=\r\nal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good information,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; May I add one more place, that is located in Rajkot Gujar=\r\nat,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ranchod Vadi, the Ranchoddasji Maharaj&#39;s ashram.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They are also doing 24 by 7 uninterrupted ram dhun for many man=\r\ny years...
