The entities whi=\r\nch live by fire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They are another class w=\r\nho mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry in=\r\nformation from earth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns f=\r\nor different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hin=\r\ndu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do actua=\r\nlly use Jinns and work out so called miracles.

The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology =\r\n- specially Hindus/Buddism/ Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C3=82 An explan=\r\nation for this maybe digressing and long.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; But generally, if I w=\r\nere born in a muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths da=\r\ny in and day out and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muham=\r\nmed as the perfected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I w=\r\nould consider Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundam=\r\nental that unless one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, the=\r\nre cannot be a reconciliation.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb started memo=\r\nrizing the koran for 9 years. At the end of the nine years he started his t=\r\nemple demolishion campaign.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is no wonder that more than 90 perce=\r\nnt of muslim youth, even those highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a =\r\ngift of Allah to the Ummah and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and &#39;compari=\r\ntive religions&#39; alive on earth.

As you =\r\ncan well understand from his poetry, his realization was quite different fr=\r\nom traditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims o=\r\nf his time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Most people=\r\n consider Sufism or Sufiana=C3=82 to be a branch of Islam. My personal view=\r\n is different. In most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sants like =\r\nJal=C3=84=EF=BF=BDl ad-D=C3=84=C2=ABn Mu=C3=A1=C2=B8=C2=A5ammad Balkh=C3=84=\r\n=C2=AB Rumi convince me that their personal realization was quite different=\r\n from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in pre=\r\n Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of these areas, specially Persia, a=\r\nfter it was over run by Islam, in order to protect their philosophy garbed =\r\nit with Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise they would have faced su=\r\nre shot slaughter. That was a means of self preservation which in turn, ove=\r\nr years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=\r\n=C3=82 than that which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about something similar to=C3=82 reinc=\r\narnation in some of his poems while the following one does talk about commu=\r\nnion with God:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; I searched for God among the Christians and =\r\non the Cross and therein I found Him not.\n&gt; &gt; I went into the ancient templ=\r\nes of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.\n&gt; &gt; I entered the mountain cave =\r\nof Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\n&gt; &gt; With set p=\r\nurpose I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s=\r\n habitation.\n&gt; &gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old =\r\nand young; God was not there even.\n&gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired abo=\r\nut him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range.\n&gt; &gt; I fared then t=\r\no the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation onl=\r\ny a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there even in that=\r\n exalted court.\n&gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him=\r\n; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Communion with God is an idea imposs=\r\nible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always seperate from the crea=\r\ntion.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogiz=\r\ne Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that was an attempt=\r\n at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nperson who changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=82 Sham=\r\ns-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was so =\r\npowerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with h=\r\nim and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In th=\r\ne name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and =\r\nyet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead =\r\nbody woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you c=\r\nannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and execu=\r\nted him.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was e=\r\nxecuted for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. This=\r\n statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India=\r\n. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva for=\r\n a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Generally, except for the f=\r\namous=C3=82 Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis =\r\nsaint. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more subject=\r\nive interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never=\r\n fooled.

Wajid Ali Shah - the nawab of Oudh was one such person. Vim=\r\nalananda says he was a Kinnara who had incarnated on this plane. Quite poss=\r\nible. He used to go mad for love of Krishna and keep playing teh dance of G=\r\nopis for Krishna. Although he used to do his five times=C3=82 Namaz as well=\r\n. There were other such Sufis too I have heard who were devoted to Krishna.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; That is what Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree i=\r\ns God, men are God, hills are God, Sun, moon and everything is God while We=\r\n\n say that everything is of Allah (God).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Trust Dr N=\r\naik when he is speaking on the Koran. Do not trust him when he speaks on an=\r\nything else. He does know his Koran well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Look at t=\r\nhis logically. Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected =\r\nman. If that perfected man could not have a directed communion with Allah e=\r\nver, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermediary,=\r\n=C3=82 why should any=C3=82 other muslim ever have a direct connection with=\r\n Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is=\r\n one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actually as far as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Ang=\r\nel, fallen by ego. The entities which live by fire as per Islam are called =\r\nthe Jinns. They are another class who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes =\r\nfrom fire. They supposedly carry information from earth to the heavens and =\r\nuse fire as a tool\n for the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Often muslim tant=\r\nriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for different purposes. I do=\r\nn&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hindu terminologies for the en=\r\ntity called Jinn, but I know people who do actually use Jinns and work out =\r\nso called miracles. Maybe they are something like spirits or beings of some=\r\n astral plane. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, one who does Homa need for=\r\n a=C3=82 deity need not worry about these in the least. When a deity like M=\r\nahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothing else will dare interfere.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But the real reason why most muslims have an issue with =\r\nfire is because in one Hadith it is mentioned prophet Muhammed disliked fir=\r\ne because it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire to them is a symbol of the fina=\r\nl times where the sinners and the kufrs will be thrown by Allah into a huge=\r\n fire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zak=\r\nir Naik, they run 180 degree\n apart in different directions or actually the=\r\ny try to make it such that they never meet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hmm, I =\r\nwould beg to disagree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I =\r\nsaid he only lies and use half truths when it comes to other religion. For =\r\nIslam he quotes correctly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam and=\r\n non Islamic ideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/ Jainism etc is irreconcil=\r\neable.=C3=82 An explanation for this maybe digressing and long.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But generally, if I were born in a muslim family, and were mad=\r\ne to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day out and trust the Koran as t=\r\nhe perfected word of God and Muhammed as the perfected man, one whose whole=\r\n life was teh Koran in motion, I would consider Zakir Naik to be 100 % corr=\r\nect. The differences are so fundamental that unless one is ready to whitewa=\r\nsh and ignore a LOT of things, there cannot be a reconciliation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb\n started memorizing the koran for 9 yea=\r\nrs. At the end of the nine years he started his temple demolishion campaign=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is no wonder that more than 90 percent of mu=\r\nslim youth, even those highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a gift of =\r\nAllah to the Ummah and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and &#39;comparitive rel=\r\nigions&#39; alive on earth. I am speaking from personal interaction. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At some point I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I =\r\ndon&#39;t. I find them to be a victim more than any one, and a victim who is no=\r\nt even aware of the fact that he is a victim! A victim not of USA=C3=82 or =\r\nZionists or Hindus or anyone. A victim of the idea called Islam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The above statement may seem controversial, but it is not a=\r\n casual remark.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness)\n is Bhairav=\r\na - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;ved=\r\nic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;=\r\nvedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Poetry of Bulle S=\r\nhah - Sufi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?=\r\nto=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, 19 November, 2009, 7:33 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Thank you for these informations on Sufis.

As you can well understand from=\r\n his poetry, his realization was quite different from traditional Islamic l=\r\nearning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his time. He was a pac=\r\nifist and a true saint.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Most people consi=\r\nder Sufism or Sufiana=C3=82 to be a branch of Islam. My personal view is di=\r\nfferent. In most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sants\n like Jal=\r\n=C3=84=EF=BF=BDl ad-D=C3=84=C2=ABn Mu=C3=A1=C2=B8=C2=A5ammad Balkh=C3=84=C2=\r\n=AB Rumi convince me that their personal realization was quite different fr=\r\nom Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in pre Is=\r\nlamic Persian and India. The mystics of these areas, specially Persia, afte=\r\nr it was over run by Islam, in order to protect their philosophy garbed it =\r\nwith Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise they would have faced sure =\r\nshot slaughter. That was a means of self preservation which in turn, over y=\r\nears, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=C3=\r\n=82 than that which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about something similar t=\r\no=C3=82 reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one does tal=\r\nk about communion with God:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I searched fo=\r\nr God among the Christians and on the Cross and therein I found Him not.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I went into the ancient\n temples of idolatry; no trace of Him wa=\r\ns there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went as =\r\nfar as Qandhar but God I found not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; With set purpose I fared t=\r\no the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and you=\r\nng; God was not there even.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired a=\r\nbout him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I f=\r\nared then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manife=\r\nstation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there e=\r\nven in that exalted court.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart=\r\n and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The cr=\r\neator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. T=\r\nhough in later verses Rumi did\n eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpr=\r\netation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic =\r\ngarb. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The person wh=\r\no changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=82 Shams-e-Tabri=\r\nzi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was so powerful =\r\nthat he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and as=\r\nked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of=\r\n Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothi=\r\nng happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke=\r\n up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot inv=\r\noke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj =\r\nwho was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Tr=\r\nuth. This statement is also considered\n Kufr as per traditional Islam. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who=\r\n introduced Qwaalis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shiva=\r\nji to worship lord Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Generally, except for the famous=C3=82 Moinunddin Chis=\r\nti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis saint. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more subjective inter=\r\npretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled. =\r\nMost of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not b=\r\nlame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell you in =\r\nno uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God commun=\r\nion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ails Is=\r\nlam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional and au=\r\nthentic version of Islam is to be\n followed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find the=\r\n fashionably spiritual higher middle class.
