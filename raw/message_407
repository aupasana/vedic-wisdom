I am looking for some punya chakra dat=\r\na - the date, time and place when certain persons left their bodies. I need=\r\n this data for some private research. The data need not be extremely accura=\r\nte upto minute. I only need the rasi chart and not all divisional charts.\n =\r\n\nSuch data is available for 15 of Ramakrishna&#39;s 16 monastic disciples. Most=\r\n of them left their bodies with some level of prior knowledge, in the midst=\r\n of people and while meditating. There were clear external signs when they =\r\nfinally left. Thus, the date and time were noted down by their disciples. T=\r\nhis data is available for Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Sarada Mata also. So =\r\nthe practice of noting the data down is there among them. So it is possible=\r\n that such data is available for some other associated people also. The boo=\r\nks I have do not give such data for the following people and I am hoping th=\r\nat some other book in English or Bengali or Hindi language that one of you =\r\nmay have may contain this data. If anybody has the data, please send it to =\r\nme and mention the book that contains the data. Thank you very much for you=\r\nr help.\n \nThe persons I am interested in are:\n \n(1) Brahmachari Krishnalal =\r\n(Swami Dhirananda). He was a close associate of Swami Yogananda, who was a =\r\ndirect disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and one of the six ishwara kotis=\r\n (ever free ones) among his disciples.\n \n(2) Priest Ramkumar. He was the el=\r\nder brother of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He was the priest at the Kali templ=\r\ne at Dakshineshwar before Ramakrishna and he was the one who brought Ramakr=\r\nishna to that temple.\n \n(3) Dhan Gopal Mukherjee. He was a disciple of Swam=\r\ni Shivananda, who was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and one =\r\nof the six ishwara kotis (ever free ones) among his disciples. Any other pe=\r\nople having a strong attachment to Swami Shivananda are also of interest to=\r\n me.\n \nIf you come across the information I want for any of these, please l=\r\net me know privately.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0249_01C91684.3EAAB9C0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I need some help.
