My assumption until now was \n&gt; that =\r\ngems are tantrik remedies at the level of controlling the body.\n \nGem is an=\r\n external object that contains some energy related to a particular planet. =\r\nIf you make it a part of your body (by wearing it), you are putting yoursel=\r\nf (body and mind) under extra influence of that planet. If that planet&#39;s in=\r\nfluence on your mind is one that makes you elated, the gem may elate you. I=\r\nf that planet&#39;s influence on your mind is one that makes you sad, the gem m=\r\nay sadden you.\n \nOn the other hand, if you invoke a deity in a gem, gem is =\r\nakin to an idol. As the gem contains the energy related to a planet, your i=\r\nnvocation of a deity who is related to that planet will result in some of t=\r\nhat deity&#39;s energy entering the gem for a small time. If you offer a mantra=\r\n related to that deity in the presence of that energy, that will please tha=\r\nt deity and strengthen an aspect of your self represented by that deity. Th=\r\nis in turn makes the planet more favorable to you. As you strengthen, with =\r\nmantra, an aspect of your self represented by a deity associated with a pla=\r\nnet, that planet becomes more favorable. Negative results become smaller in=\r\n magnitude and positive results become magnified.\n \nLet us try an analogy t=\r\no clarify further.\n \nWearing a gem is akin to bringing someone to your hous=\r\ne and keeping him in your house. If he likes you, he will make your life ha=\r\nppy. If he does not like you, he will make your life miserable.\n \nPraying t=\r\no a deity corresponding to a planet is akin to getting help from somebody w=\r\nho has influence on that person, so that the person behaves better with you=\r\n due to that influence\n \nChanting the mantra of a planet or its deity in fr=\r\nont of the gem before wearing the gem is akin to keeping a person in the co=\r\nmpany of somebody who has influence over him before bringing him to your ho=\r\nuse, so that he is influenced sufficiently.\n \nIn your case, Mercury has cer=\r\ntain weaknesses and emerald is a dicey choice for you. However, if you offe=\r\nr enough mantra of Lord Ramachandra in front of that gem, it should become =\r\nmore favorable to you and actually eventually give you the result of the ra=\r\nja yoga between Sun and Mercury. Hence my advice..\n \nThese are my 2 cents.\n=\r\n \n&gt; I dont want to blindly do it, but I am saving this advice \n&gt; for a litt=\r\nle later hopefully when I am a little more spiritually \n&gt; advanced.\n \nLogic=\r\nal. Of course, it is totally upto you.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Dear Nar=\r\nasimhaji,\n&gt;  Thank you for taking the time out to reply to me. Thank you fo=\r\nr the \n&gt; tips about using &quot;shastyamsa like trimsamsa&quot;. Is there an article =\r\n\n&gt; that discusses more deeply the use of shastyamsa like trimsamsa? \n&gt; Beca=\r\nuse I did look at the &quot;Parasara&#39;s trimsamsa&quot; and found Mercury \n&gt; to be qui=\r\nte benefic as it is 1,4L in 5. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Also, in general, I am very confused =\r\nabout gem energies and their \n&gt; relationship to planetary energies in gener=\r\nal. I would welcome an in-\n&gt; depth explanation from you, or perhaps a refer=\r\nence to an article you \n&gt; recommend on the same. Your statement about &quot;wors=\r\nhipping the gem \n&gt; instead&quot; has really gotten me confused. My assumption un=\r\ntil now was \n&gt; that gems are tantrik remedies at the level of controlling t=\r\nhe body. \n&gt; We chant the &quot;more external&quot; perhaps body influencing mantras (=\r\n?)\n&gt; appropriate to the planet signifying the gem in order for the gem to \n=\r\n&gt; be permanently imbued by that energy. Hence by wearing it the gem&#39;s \n&gt; im=\r\nbued energy perhaps affects and removes the obstacles to that \n&gt; planetary =\r\nenergy within us (?). Clearly my understanding is flawed, \n&gt; because if it =\r\nisnt, then what good can worshipping the gem at a \n&gt; distance possibly do? =\r\nDoes it act as a sink to some bad energies \n&gt; around us?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you too=\r\n for the advice about the &quot;Rina Vimochaka Angaaraka \n&gt; Stotram&quot;. I have no =\r\ndoubt it is the correct advice, but I feel I am \n&gt; not quite there yet in t=\r\nerms of mental receptivity to these deeper \n&gt; mantras. I dont want to blind=\r\nly do it, but I am saving this advice \n&gt; for a little later hopefully when =\r\nI am a little more spiritually \n&gt; advanced. Also, I think I wrongly conveye=\r\nd that I was doing the \n&gt; Gayatri mantra to quickly alleviate my financial =\r\nsituation. As you \n&gt; must have noticed the Moon in my chart is in debilitat=\r\ned Navamsa, \n&gt; conjunct Saturn in Rasi, 7th aspect of Mars. My mind tends t=\r\no get \n&gt; troubled quickly. I was unconsciously led to the Gayatri mantra \n&gt;=\r\n somehow, in a very tough moment. And it ended up sort of gently \n&gt; uplifti=\r\nng my mind and somewhat increasing its awareness. I didnt do \n&gt; it with any=\r\n motive at all, and still dont, except this gentle \n&gt; uplifting somewhat ex=\r\npansive feeling. The debts remain, but dont \n&gt; bother me as much. I want to=\r\n address the debts only to not have my \n&gt; wife or kids go through any suffe=\r\nring, thats all. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In sohamsa@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Though Mercury is the 5th lord in 5th, he is also the retrograde \n&gt; 8t=\r\nh \n&gt; &gt; lord. Moreover, he is the 8th lord in trimsamsa (D-30), which \n&gt; sho=\r\nws \n&gt; &gt; suffering and punishment (use &quot;shashtyamsa like trimsamsa&quot;). He is =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; your 22nd drekkana lord too (using Jagannatha drekkana chart, \n&gt; which=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; is the correct drekkana chart for reckoning the 22nd drekkana). \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nUnfortunately, he does not become a benefic in navamsa (which \n&gt; could \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n have protected). When a planet owns 8th in rasi and trimsamsa and \n&gt; &gt; hap=\r\npens to be a rank malefic in navamsa also, it is a bad idea to \n&gt; &gt; wear th=\r\nat planet&#39;s gem.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The muhurta you picked is fine, except for chara=\r\n karaka \n&gt; parivartana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; My advice would be to remove the gem/chai=\r\nn from your body, put it \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; your pooja room and worship it instead.=\r\n After your Gayatri japam \n&gt; &gt; everyday, point your hands at the emerald an=\r\nd say &quot;asmin marakate  \n&gt; &gt; Sree Ramachandram aavaahayaami&quot;, then offer som=\r\ne akshatas on the \n&gt; &gt; emerald and then do japam with the mantra &quot;Om Sree R=\r\naama Raama \n&gt; &gt; Raama&quot;. That will give you much more benefit than actually =\r\nwearing \n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Regarding heavy debts, you have Mars in 8th. Cur=\r\nrent dasa is of \n&gt; &gt; Venus and Venus is in kaaraka sthaana from Mars (using=\r\n Paachakaadi \n&gt; &gt; sambandhas). So he advances the result of Mars in 8th \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (debts/accidents etc). No wonder the debts continue to trouble. \n&gt; For \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Mars, you can do &quot;Rina Vimochaka Angaaraka Stotram&quot;. If you can \n&gt; read =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that stotram for 2 hours continuously everyday for 60 days while \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmaintaining brahmacharya during the 60 days, it should have a \n&gt; &gt; consider=\r\nable impact on your debt situation. If you can commit such \n&gt; &gt; an amount o=\r\nf time, please send a private mail and I will give the \n&gt; &gt; stotra and also=\r\n the procedure. One should remember that serious \n&gt; &gt; karmas require seriou=\r\ns remedies. One cannot expect to do a mantra \n&gt; &gt; 108 times and get rid of =\r\nserious problems.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;vedicastrostud=\r\nent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My birthdata is 23:00pm, 29=\r\n June 1967, +5:30 GMT, 78E46, 22N12. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aquarius ascendant, Mercury 5, =\r\n8L vargottama in 5.

Thank you for the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tips about using=\r\n \n&quot;shastyamsa like trimsamsa&quot;. Is there an article &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that discusses =\r\nmore \ndeeply the use of shastyamsa like trimsamsa? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Because I did l=\r\nook at the \n&quot;Parasara&#39;s trimsamsa&quot; and found Mercury &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be quite b=\r\nenefic as it is \n1,4L in 5. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Also, in general, I am =\r\nvery confused about \ngem energies and their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; relationship to planet=\r\nary energies in general. I \nwould welcome an in-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; depth explanation =\r\nfrom you, or perhaps a reference \nto an article you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; recommend on t=\r\nhe same. Your statement about \n&quot;worshipping the gem &lt;BR&gt;&gt; instead&quot; has r=\r\neally gotten me confused. My \nassumption until now was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that gems a=\r\nre tantrik remedies at the level of \ncontrolling the body. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We chan=\r\nt the &quot;more external&quot; perhaps body \ninfluencing mantras (?)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; appropr=\r\niate to the planet signifying the gem in \norder for the gem to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be =\r\npermanently imbued by that energy. Hence by \nwearing it the gem&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nimbued energy perhaps affects and removes the \nobstacles to that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; p=\r\nlanetary energy within us (?). Clearly my \nunderstanding is flawed, &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; because if it isnt, then what good can \nworshipping the gem at a &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n distance possibly do? Does it act as a sink to \nsome bad energies &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n around us?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you too for the \nadvice about the &quot;Rina =\r\nVimochaka Angaaraka &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Stotram&quot;. I have no doubt it \nis the correct a=\r\ndvice, but I feel I am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not quite there yet in terms of \nmental rec=\r\neptivity to these deeper &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras. I dont want to blindly do \nit, b=\r\nut I am saving this advice &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for a little later hopefully when I am =\r\n\na little more spiritually &lt;BR&gt;&gt; advanced. Also, I think I wrongly conve=\r\nyed \nthat I was doing the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra to quickly alleviate my f=\r\ninancial \nsituation. As you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; must have noticed the Moon in my chart=\r\n is in \ndebilitated Navamsa, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; conjunct Saturn in Rasi, 7th aspect o=\r\nf Mars. My \nmind tends to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; troubled quickly. I was unconsciousl=\r\ny led to the \nGayatri mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; somehow, in a very tough moment. And =\r\nit ended up sort of \ngently &lt;BR&gt;&gt; uplifting my mind and somewhat increas=\r\ning its awareness. I didnt \ndo &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it with any motive at all, and stil=\r\nl dont, except this gentle \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; uplifting somewhat expansive feeling. =\r\nThe debts remain, but dont \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; bother me as much. I want to address t=\r\nhe debts only to not have my \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wife or kids go through any sufferin=\r\ng, thats all. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nThanks again,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sundeep&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;s=\r\nohamsa@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha \nRao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Sundeep,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though M=\r\nercury is the 5th lord in 5th, he is also the \nretrograde &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 8th &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; lord. Moreover, he is the 8th lord in \ntrimsamsa (D-30), which &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; shows &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; suffering and punishment \n(use &quot;shashtyamsa like=\r\n trimsamsa&quot;). He is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your 22nd drekkana lord \ntoo (using Jagan=\r\nnatha drekkana chart, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is the \ncorrect drekkana=\r\n chart for reckoning the 22nd drekkana). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nUnfortunately, he d=\r\noes not become a benefic in navamsa (which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; could \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ha=\r\nve protected). When a planet owns 8th in rasi and trimsamsa and \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; happens to be a rank malefic in navamsa also, it is a bad idea to \n&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; wear that planet&#39;s gem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The \nmuh=\r\nurta you picked is fine, except for chara karaka &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nparivartana.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My advice would be to remove the \ngem/chain f=\r\nrom your body, put it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your pooja room and \nworshi=\r\np it instead. After your Gayatri japam &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everyday, point your \n=\r\nhands at the emerald and say &quot;asmin marakate&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sree \nRama=\r\nchandram aavaahayaami&quot;, then offer some akshatas on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nemer=\r\nald and then do japam with the mantra &quot;Om Sree Raama Raama &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nR=\r\naama&quot;. That will give you much more benefit than actually wearing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \nit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding heavy debts, you have =\r\nMars in \n8th. Current dasa is of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Venus and Venus is in kaarak=\r\na sthaana from \nMars (using Paachakaadi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sambandhas). So he ad=\r\nvances the result of \nMars in 8th &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (debts/accidents etc). No w=\r\nonder the debts continue to \ntrouble. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mars, you =\r\ncan do &quot;Rina Vimochaka Angaaraka \nStotram&quot;. If you can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; read &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; that stotram for 2 hours \ncontinuously everyday for 60 days while &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; maintaining brahmacharya \nduring the 60 days, it should have a=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; considerable impact on your \ndebt situation. If you can comm=\r\nit such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; an amount of time, please \nsend a private mail and I =\r\nwill give the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; stotra and also the \nprocedure. One should reme=\r\nmber that serious &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karmas require serious \nremedies. One canno=\r\nt expect to do a mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 108 times and get rid \nof serious pro=\r\nblems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nNarasim=\r\nha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do \nHomam Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;sohamsa@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;, \n&quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;vedicastrostudent@&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear all,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; My \nbirthdata is 23:00pm, 29 June 1967, +5:30 GMT, 78E46, 22N12.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nAquarius ascendant, Mercury 5, 8L vargottama in 5.
