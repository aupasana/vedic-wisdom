Howev=\r\ner, if one likes chapati and curries, forcing one to eat pasta may not work=\r\n. If one likes grilled sandwiches, forcing one to eat rice and dal may not =\r\nwork.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, do you get more spiritual strength by doing hom=\r\nam with a mantra or japam with a mantra or pranayama with a\n&gt;  mantra or so=\r\n many sadhana paths?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is possible to get balanced spiritual pr=\r\nogress through each path. However, if one likes singing prayers, forcing on=\r\ne to do pranayama may not work. If one likes japam, forcing one to do homam=\r\n may not work.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; What style of food one=\r\n eats, how many times a day one eats, how much food one eats each time is s=\r\necondary (though it matters too). How well one is enjoying food and digesti=\r\nng it is primary.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, what sadhana one does, how many yea=\r\nrs one does sadhana for and how many hours one spends in sadhana everyday i=\r\ns secondary (though it matters too). How involved one is in and how much on=\r\ne is enjoying sadhana is primary.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one finds a sadhana that on=\r\ne can enjoy and engage in without forcing oneself mechanically and if one f=\r\neels love and attachment to the tools, symbols\n&gt;  and steps involved in tha=\r\nt sadhana, one is lucky. Otherwise, one may engage in a sadhana mechanicall=\r\ny for a long time without making much progress.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But, realize tha=\r\nt one may have to try many cuisines before finding what one really loves. S=\r\necondly, one may dislike a cuisine at first and slowly get hooked. All thes=\r\ne variables are there. But, eventually, one needs to enjoy what one is eati=\r\nng, to digest well. Similarly, one needs to eventually start enjoying one&#39;s=\r\n sadhana, to progress spiritually.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ha=\r\nving said that, fire is something separate and special. Almost every ancien=\r\nt culture and civilization worshipped god in sacred fire.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; No mat=\r\nter what kind of food one eats, eating some ginger can provoke one&#39;s appeti=\r\nte and make one digest better. Similarly, no matter what kind of sadhana on=\r\ne does, doing some fire worship can\n&gt;  provoke one&#39;s internal fire and make=\r\n one digest better.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Also, just as a good nutritionist working wi=\r\nth one can help one in picking the right balance of foods, a good guru or m=\r\nentor working with one can help one in picking the right balance of sadhana=\r\ns.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; So a good guru/mentor and company of fire are two things that=\r\n put one in good stead, irrespective of what else one does.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I do not like to comment on specific people or organ=\r\nizations. But, I&#39;d *in general* be suspicious of anyone who says they have =\r\na special and effective spiritual path, then controls and guards the detail=\r\ns tightly and puts a price on it. That is not the way of rishis. That is no=\r\nt the way of Sanatana Dharma.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But if one tries such a path and b=\r\nenefits, good for them.
