This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges =\r\nof energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of k=\r\nundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We=\r\n have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests n=\r\normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people =\r\nwe call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or u=\r\nnwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and re=\r\nsearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patien=\r\nts are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatment=\r\ns for deranged kundalini, we\n struggle to help them.Many yogis try to forci=\r\nbly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling =\r\nthat kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill her=\r\nself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She=\r\n feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from.I wo=\r\nndered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to =\r\npray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the su=\r\nffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bea=\r\nr this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and =\r\nfor others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pi=\r\ntiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this si=\r\ntuation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It i=\r\ns perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini=\r\n rising bit to God&#39;s\n will.Om Dum Durgayai NamahaAparna \n&gt;\r\n--1082104826-1243162743-1362049500=:92377\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: =\r\nauto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly cor=\r\nrect&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the=\r\n ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manth=\r\nra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc =\r\nwith the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are under the protection of&nbsp; a m=\r\nahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wiped=\r\n off .

Moreover, even if such a =\r\ndiagnosis is correctly\n done, very few can have the right knowledge to rect=\r\nify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing m=\r\nore than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have results, sometim=\r\nes not.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a soun=\r\nd mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - &lt;SPAN class=3Dy=\r\niv2144221678st&gt;Mens sana in corpore sano.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;-Regards&lt;WBR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;Rajarshi &lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv2144221678MsoN=\r\normal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; class=3Dyiv2144221678Apple-style-s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(153,153,153)&quot; class=3Dyiv2144221678Apple-s=\r\ntyle-span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman=\r\n, new york, times, serif&quot; class=3Dyiv2144221678yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&gt;=\r\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv2144221=\r\n678yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv2144221678yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv=\r\n2144221678yui_3_7_2_17_1362045432997_73&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 face=3D&quot;Time=\r\ns New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; FONT=\r\n-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, =\r\nserif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING=\r\n-BOTTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0; MARGIN: 5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-R=\r\nIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nRIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3Dhr contentEditable=3Dfalse=\r\n readonly=3D&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;=\r\n/B&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FON=\r\nT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 =\r\nPM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Kundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv2144221678&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv2144221678ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear all,&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent expe=\r\nrience of a patient of mine.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;I am doing a psychiatry job at presen=\r\nt, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has=\r\n had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has i=\r\nnvolved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is no=\r\nt of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms star=\r\nted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anyt=\r\nhing physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this=\r\n is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe th=\r\nemselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini aw=\r\nakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainst=\r\nream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by we=\r\nstern medicine, and as we have no treatments\n for deranged kundalini, we st=\r\nruggle to help them.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalin=\r\ni. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should =\r\nnot be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because =\r\nthe suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume=\r\n her, and it is something she cannot escape from.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;I wondered what =\r\nsolution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the =\r\nDivine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of t=\r\nhis woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May =\r\nI request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others l=\r\nike her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. &lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situ=\r\nation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is =\r\nperhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your\n instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini =\r\nrising bit to God&#39;s will.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Om Dum Durgayai Namaha&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Aparna &lt;=\r\nWBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1082104826-1243162743-1362049500=:92377--\r\n\n"}}
