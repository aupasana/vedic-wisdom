He says (and \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha has many a times repeate=\r\nd) that Karma is only generated \n&gt; &gt; (Binding to one) when one self-identif=\r\nies with it.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually=\r\n, the state is \n&gt; &gt; multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s=\r\n an extremely \n&gt; &gt; important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;=\r\n Important information about Vimalananda which I came to know only \n&gt; &gt; yes=\r\nterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single \n&gt; &gt; day=\r\n passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nof his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting \n&gt; &gt; coin=\r\ncidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also \n&gt; &gt; not=\r\ne an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all \n&gt; &gt; hi=\r\ns audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;=\r\n Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions \n&gt; &gt; y=\r\nou asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are \n&gt; &gt; thoug=\r\nhts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). \n&gt; &gt; Whe=\r\nn we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or \n&gt; &gt; Sainbab=\r\na or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to \n&gt; &gt; forget t=\r\nhat they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of \n&gt; &gt; spirit=\r\nual realization. They are knower of everything or many things in \n&gt; &gt; the u=\r\nniverse. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to \n&gt; &gt; uni=\r\nversal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are \n&gt; &gt; `Trikaa=\r\nl gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say \n&gt; &gt; that if =\r\nthey ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, \n&gt; &gt; they a=\r\nctually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific \n&gt; &gt; pur=\r\npose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they \n&gt; &gt; kn=\r\now complete background behind their each action and\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; moreover their s=\r\nelf identification is missing from the action and \n&gt; &gt; hence it is like Nat=\r\nure operates through them to accomplish a special \n&gt; &gt; purpose without bind=\r\ning them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Ramakrishna used to frequently s=\r\nay to all his disciples that Naren is \n&gt; &gt; very different from others. He h=\r\nas a blazing spiritual fire burning \n&gt; &gt; within him which can consume anyth=\r\ning and everything. A food restriction \n&gt; &gt; does not bind him. He can eat a=\r\nnything without getting spiritually \n&gt; &gt; troubled but for others, a kind of=\r\n food intake is extremely important.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during =\r\nhis stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have \n&gt; &gt; some subtle purpose which is not p=\r\nossible for majority of us to \n&gt; &gt; comprehend unless explained by a person =\r\nof that level. He might be \n&gt; &gt; removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers a=\r\nmongst westerners so that he \n&gt; &gt; can be accepted by them as one of them an=\r\nd then slowly try to eradicate \n&gt; &gt; their habits of meat eating and such ot=\r\nher undesirable habits. It is \n&gt; &gt; also possible at the same time that he i=\r\ns nullifying some balanced \n&gt; &gt; Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat h=\r\ne ate. It is also possible \n&gt; &gt; that he would have showered his unseen bles=\r\nsings on the animal&#39;s soul by \n&gt; &gt; consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that t=\r\nhere were no apparent reasons \n&gt; &gt; for that but just a natural inconsequent=\r\nial act. We&#39;ll not know. Only \n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature =\r\nknow. By the way Vivekananda \n&gt; &gt; saved a boy from drowning in a lake in US=\r\nA while he was still in India \n&gt; &gt; and did not even planned to go to USA. W=\r\nhen the boy, after some\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; years actually met Swami in USA for the firs=\r\nt time, swami immediately \n&gt; &gt; told him to stay away from water and when he=\r\n requested swami to accept \n&gt; &gt; him as his disciple, swami, after a moments=\r\n thought told him that he is \n&gt; &gt; not his guru and his guru will come later=\r\n and will give him Silver Cup \n&gt; &gt; as a gift. That man later became discipl=\r\ne of Paramhansa Yogananda and \n&gt; &gt; after 40 years, he was actually given a =\r\ngift of Silver-cup by Yogananda \n&gt; &gt; which literally fulfilled what swami V=\r\nivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Swami Vivekananda was all =\r\nknowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; So moral of my whole writings=\r\n is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self \n&gt; &gt; deluding to take excuses of the u=\r\nnconventional habits of Swami \n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalanand=\r\na, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami \n&gt; &gt; Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters an=\r\nd justify our completely self \n&gt; &gt; identified and utterly selfish cruel/unj=\r\nust actions.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  &gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2 I was about to ask this ques=\r\ntion \n&gt; &gt; today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2  It is clear from the below pas=\r\nsage meat \n&gt; &gt; eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2 \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; I was=\r\n=C3=82=C2 reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in \n&gt; &gt; Te=\r\nlugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n when he was living in USA also relished it.

That is why you find a \n&gt; &gt; meat-eater reborn either as a predato=\r\nr or prey or as both in succession. \n&gt; &gt; Human beings cry a lot at funerals=\r\n of their own kind but they have \n&gt; &gt; absolutely no thought for the sufferi=\r\nngs of the animals they slaughter. \n&gt; &gt; They never hesitate to kill and eat=\r\n. Just think, first they kill the \n&gt; &gt; chicken. Often they will cut its thr=\r\noat and let it bleed to death, which \n&gt; &gt; is a most painful way to die. The=\r\nn it will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, \n&gt; &gt; and if it happens to be tough =\r\neveryone will curse it for not satisfying \n&gt; &gt; their palates. How many huma=\r\nns would give beautiful tender lean meat if \n&gt; &gt; they were slaughtered, dre=\r\nssed, prepared and served?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that an=\r\nimal mothers too love their \n&gt; &gt; children. Do they ever think of the agony =\r\na hen goes through when her \n&gt; &gt; chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or =\r\na cow, the embodiment of \n&gt; &gt; motherliness, do they consider how much she s=\r\nuffers when she sees the \n&gt; &gt; slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has gr=\r\nown in her own body and \n&gt; &gt; nourished with her milk, whom she loves more t=\r\nhan her own life?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the terr=\r\nible pain they \n&gt; &gt; cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own childr=\r\nen being murdered \n&gt; &gt; before their own eyes?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; How is Ma to teach s=\r\nuch donkeys? They are not humans, whose \n&gt; &gt; intellect is subtle enough to =\r\nself-identify with another being of a \n&gt; &gt; different species and experience=\r\n its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has \n&gt; &gt; no alternative but to make them=\r\n suffer, allowing the animals they have \n&gt; &gt; tortured to torture them in re=\r\nturn. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut \n&gt; &gt; your throat in this birth you h=\r\nave every right to cut mine in the next \n&gt; &gt; or some succeeding birth.
