It had single most focus. Wondering=\r\n and admiring the \nbrightness.\n\nI experience the same kind of focus when I =\r\nsit in front of a bright \nlight or Fire.\n\nSo, I do see and believe, it help=\r\ns me focus my mind to a large extent. \nThe fire offers bright light, and he=\r\nat. When the fire is bigger, the \nbrightness and the patterns it shows to t=\r\nhe closed eyes are more \nenchanting and impressive. So, the other thoughts =\r\ngo out of our mind.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can =\r\nyou please help me reconcile the superiority of homam with the \nplace\n&gt; tha=\r\nt japa finds in the nityahnika procedure?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Obviously, Parasara did no=\r\nt advise japam (meditation) of various \nmantras\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; instead advised h=\r\nomam (fire ritual) with various mantras, for a \nreason.\n&gt; &gt; . . .\n&gt; &gt; If yo=\r\nu do the same meditation in front of an external fire, it \nmakes a big\n&gt; di=\r\nfference.\n&gt; \n&gt; As part of nityahnikam, the prescribed method for dvijas is =\r\nto \nperform japa\n&gt; followed by the nitya homam (in the form of aupasana). T=\r\nhis ordering \nis\n&gt; followed in ahnika texts followed by various communities=\r\n. If homa is \nmuch\n&gt; more effective, I would expect there to be *some* dhar=\r\nma shastra\n&gt; prescription which prefers performing _this_ required daily ja=\r\npa as \nhoma.\n&gt; The rishis / grihya-sutra-kartas would never have left such =\r\nan \nopportunity\n&gt; alone. At the very least, I would expect these texts to p=\r\nrescribe \nthe\n&gt; performance of japa after the aupasana, in front of the kin=\r\ndled \nfire. Do you\n&gt; know of any smriti texts / shishtachara which follows =\r\nsuch a \nprocedure? If\n&gt; not, can you please help me understand such an abse=\r\nnce?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; If you do the same meditation in front of an external fire,=\r\n it \nmakes a\n&gt; big difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any benefit in performing japa=\r\n in front of a lit fireplace, \nwhere\n&gt; no agnimukham has been performed.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; bhavadIyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt;        ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
