His books are not easy reads and appeal more to th=\r\ne intellect. They are not useful for enhancing ones practice since they are=\r\n written from an academic angle. They also refer specifically to the philos=\r\nophies or guided thinking of certain schools of practice. \n\nAS you can see =\r\nmany of these comments are generic and can be applied to a host of other bo=\r\noks.
