If you yourself feel guilty, there is no reason why you sh=\r\nould seek others opinion. If you are open to leave this activity, then aski=\r\nng this question to others makes sense.\n\nYour statement that if you do not =\r\ndo, some one else will do is also wrong in attitude.\n\nIf a act is bad in na=\r\nture, both the following arguments are wrong in attitude:\n1. I know this is=\r\n bad, but I am forced to do\n2. If I don&#39;t do, some else will do. So, this a=\r\nct will any way happen. I can do it and I am only a nimitta.\n\nIf you stop t=\r\nhis activity, you may losse the additional money, and hence loose comforts =\r\nand may have to go through financial problems. You have to make a judgement=\r\n if you are mentally and physically strong to face it. If you are not ready=\r\n for it, try to explore another avenue to get revenue by doing an act that =\r\ndoes not make you guilty.\n\nPersonally, I do not feel writing TV episodes is=\r\n a bad karma. Yes, the characters may be behaving badly, but, I am not real=\r\nly sure, if that results in bad behaviour in the viewers.\n\nMy personal opin=\r\nion and others personal opinions apart, if you feel guilty about, you plan =\r\nfor leaving it. That is my advice.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, uma shanker &lt;aliens19672004@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Do your duty =\r\nand leave the rest to the god.=A0 Sri Krishna himself has advised Arjun abo=\r\nut doing ones=A0 Karma.=A0 We are here only to do things and not to think w=\r\nhether we are doing right or wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 7/15/0=\r\n9, rajesh_rajgor2003 &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: rajesh_rajgo=\r\nr2003 &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Please help me\n&gt; To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, July 15, 2009, 1:16 PM\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             \n&gt;             \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n       \n&gt;       Shri Narsimha Guruji,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure, whether I h=\r\nave right to address you as Narsimha Guruji or not ? I donot know whether i=\r\n have the eligibility to become your Shishya also.  Still, i respect you as=\r\n my Guruji and i am blessed to have found you. I should thank my friend, ut=\r\npal for this.. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I need your help. Professionally i work for priv=\r\nate company in accounts and administration department since past 20 years. =\r\nBesides my profession, i am script writer also.. To earn more money, to lea=\r\nd good standard of life and to pay back my home loans, i have started writi=\r\nng script for Television serial as a part time job. I am doing this script =\r\nwriting work since past 4-5 years. Considering my creative talents and good=\r\n language control (not praising myself)I am getting good assignments of wri=\r\nting TV serials.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All daily soap television serials are glorifyin=\r\ng more negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.. enemities.. Sometimes i am feeling=\r\n guilty of writing scenes which shows  Conflicts between SAAS and BAHU, Con=\r\nflicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts between BROTHER and BROTHER. I am =\r\ncompelled to write harsh dialogues which hurts me sometimes.. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe formula on which TV serials are now based follow this: &quot;More conflicts m=\r\neans more drama and more drama means more TRP(Television rating points)and =\r\nMore TRP means more benefits, more money and popularity to the serial&quot;.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Guruji, I feel that i am doing wrong by writing serials.. I am pass=\r\ning wrong messages to the society.. i feel guilty about it. I am not in a p=\r\nosition to leave this as it gives me more money besides it also gives me go=\r\nod standard of life and good recognition also.. If i would leave this someo=\r\nne else would do it.. What should i do? I am really confused. If i will lea=\r\nve writing this, i will find more difficult to survive in this world with h=\r\nome loan and two small school going children..I need your help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n was fortunate to discuss this with utpal. He guided me to write this mail =\r\nto you.. to seek your guidance..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Waiting anxiously your reply.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Respectful regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
