Spend AS MUCH time as you can, on spiritual sadhana.\n\nApart from the time you spend in formal spiritual sadhana, try to make every \nactivity of life a sadhana. Consider what you do to others around you as an \noffering to the Lord who came in the form of those people. Consider what \nothers do to you as a blessing from the lord. Give whatever you can to \nothers, but do not expect much from others. Happily and gratefully receive \nwhatever you get from others. Take this human life as an opportunity to give \nand pay off debts, rather than taking things from others. Never expect \nanything for yourself.\n\nAlways remember that you are not this body or the mind in it. The tendency \nto be happy about some things and sad about some things is the cause of many \nproblems. Try to be balanced, keep reminding yourself now and then that you \nare not the body or the mind, and not let things done to your body or ideas \nin the mind make you overly happy or sad. All sadhana is meant for getting \ncontrol over emotions and reach a state of equanimity of the mind.\n\nOut of various forms of spiritual sadhana I know, homam is the best. Fire is \nliving god and known as the purifier. Invoking gods in fire and chanting \nmantras in front of fire while making offerings is a great practice. Such \nfire worship was a key part of several ancient religions. We are acting on a \nspecific command from the divine Mother to my spiritual guru Dr Manish \nPandit 3.5 years back, to spread simple homam procedures for various deities \naround the world.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 29, 2009 3:18 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] query\n\n\n&gt; Dear Guru Narsimha ji,\n&gt;                        pranam.\n&gt;\n&gt; We are supposed to face results of our past karamas and to end loop of \n&gt; birth we have to realize God, Many times our destiny is so bad that we \n&gt; have to face a lot of difficulties in life due to our past actions\n&gt;\n&gt; 1] So can u pls tell me how much time one should devote to spiritual \n&gt; activities to pass life in better way and reach main goal of realisation \n&gt; also through some light about sadhna which one should do\n&gt;\n&gt; 2] Can u pls tell me about your spiritual activities in a day , what \n&gt; sadhna  or homam you do, it can be inspiring for me, how is your scedule \n&gt; in a day as you spent alot of time in sadhna and helping others\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; rakesh\n\n\n"}}
