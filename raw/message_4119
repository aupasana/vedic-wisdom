V. Narasimha Swami was the first English biographer of Sri Ramana\nMahar=\r\nshi. He asked many devotees and disciples to write about their lives\nand ex=\r\nperiences with the Master. Yogi Ramiah submitted a 2000 word essay,\nfrom wh=\r\nich B.V.N. extracted a short edited account to print in his book,\ntitled Se=\r\nlf-Realization.\n\nThe following is B. V. Narasimha Swami&#39;s edited account pu=\r\nblished in Self\nRealization, followed by the full autobiographical essay wr=\r\nitten by the Yogi\nhimself. All this text has been printed in Arunachala&#39;s R=\r\namana, Boundless\nOcean of Grace, Book II, published by Sri Ramanasramam and=\r\n available at the\nAshram Bookstall in Tiruvannamalai.\n\nYogi Ramiah belongs =\r\nto the community of Reddiars and was a wealthy land\nproprietor of Annareddi=\r\npalayam, near Buchi Reddipalayam, Nellore District. He\nreceived hardly any =\r\neducation. Being the sole owner of his properties he had\nevery inducement t=\r\no pass his days merrily with his thoughtless companions,\nboys of his own ag=\r\ne. But at about the age of eighteen his thoughts took a\nserious turn and he=\r\n gave up his former associates and took an interest in\nreligion.\n\nA Brahmin=\r\n Guru imparted to him the Rama Taraka Mantram and asked him to\nrepeat it fi=\r\nve thousand times daily. &quot;If the number is exceeded, what then?&quot;\nasked the =\r\nardent youth.\n\n&quot;So much the better,&quot; was the Guru&#39;s reply.\n\n&quot;If I repeat it=\r\n always?&quot; was the next query. The Guru was delighted at the\nkeenness of the=\r\n disciple&#39;s enthusiasm and expressed warm approval.\n\nRamiah went on with hi=\r\ns japam from morning till night, whatever he might be\ndoing. He also began =\r\nto practice pranayanam, breath control. Consequently,\nvairagya, or disgust =\r\nwith his worldly surroundings, grew so strong in his\nbreast that he suddenl=\r\ny left home to go north to perform tapas in holy\nplaces like Kasi, etc.\n\nFo=\r\nr many years he still continued with his life of yoga, with mounam\n(silence=\r\n) and tapas, as its support. He ate little, controlled his breath\nand staye=\r\nd many hours at a stretch in blissful ecstasy, mostly in the\ncottage of his=\r\n own garden. He would also stay for a few months each year\nwith Maharshi at=\r\n Ramanasramam. He loved and was loved by the Maharshi. As\nYogi Ramiah did n=\r\not know Tamil, the Maharshi translated his Tamil poems\n.Upadesa Saram. and =\r\n.Ulladu Narpadu. into Telugu. In appreciation, Yogi\nRamiah helped in repair=\r\ning Palithirtam, in the construction of Asramam hall\nand the Asramam well.\n=\r\n\nThe original manuscript, wherein Yogi Ramiah tells in his own words about\n=\r\nhis life and experiences:\n\nFrom my boyhood I had great devotion (bhakti) to=\r\nwards Sri Rama Namam. Till I\nwas nineteen years old I was generally of a ra=\r\njasic temperament and was\nfearless. I used to listen attentively whenever e=\r\nlders recited stories of\nGod or taught dharma; and I used to make friendshi=\r\np with such elders.Though\nI was not a bhakta from childhood like Kabir, I g=\r\not vairagyam and wanted to\ndo penance (tapas) like Valmiki, until the body =\r\nis covered with ant hills.\nSubsequently love for the body (dehabhimanam) di=\r\nsappeared.\n\nFormerly I had many friends, but the feeling of friendship for =\r\nthem left me.\nI couldn&#39;t leave the continuous dhyanam (meditation) even for=\r\n a minute. I\nused to feel sorry that the nights were being wasted in sleep.=\r\n I used to\nfeel that I was meditating even in my sleep. I used to be in med=\r\nitation when\nI awoke. I used to get up at 3 o.clock in the morning, bathe a=\r\nnd, sitting in\na secluded place, would meditate till 8 o.clock. From 8 a.m.=\r\n to 11 a.m. I\nwould read Bhagavatam. After meals I would listen to Bhagavat=\r\nam read by a\nBrahmin. In the evenings, I would go outside the town and medi=\r\ntate sitting\nalone. Even if such a place be the pathway used by men and cat=\r\ntle, I would\nneither know of or hear anything during meditation. I used to =\r\noffer puja,\nimagining the form of Vishnu in my heart.\n\nWithout telling anyb=\r\nody I wanted to go to Dandaka Forest and do penance like\nValmiki and the ri=\r\nshis. Before traveling north, I got down from the train to\nmeet my Guru at =\r\nBapatla, in the Guntur District. As soon as he saw me he\nasked whether I ha=\r\nd left home after informing my people. I told him the\ntruth, that is, that =\r\nI did not inform anyone. He then told me, &quot;You cannot\nstay there (Dandaka F=\r\norest) and do penance. There are many difficulties\nthere. Have an asramam i=\r\nn your village and do penance there. I will come and\nsee you occasionally. =\r\nGo back home to your village.&quot; Before leaving to\nreturn to my home, he gave=\r\n me upadesam.\n\nThere was no desire to eat anything. In spite of bodily diff=\r\niculties the\nmind was always happy. I was thinking of Rama in saguna aspect=\r\n and offering\npuja to Hari in my heart.\n\nAs the external vision decreased, =\r\nI wanted to go to experienced gurus with\nBrahma Nishta and tell them about =\r\nmy experiences and to find out what their\nexperiences were. By enquiry I fo=\r\nund out that there were many who had read\nbooks only, without experiencing =\r\nthe Self and I could not find any with\nBrahma Nishta. In my boyhood when I =\r\ncame on a pilgrimage to Arunagiri I saw\nBhagavan. Since then, at times, I u=\r\nsed to think of him. Learning that\nBhagavan knows Telugu, I went to him, of=\r\nfered my respects, sat in his\npresence and was looking at him.\n\nI asked him=\r\n some questions:\n\nQ. What is Nirvikalpa Samadhi?\nA. That which has no sanka=\r\nlpam to Nirvikalpa.\nQ. In Samadhi, will there not be even the Brahma Bhava?=\r\n\nA. If there is Bhava, it will not be Nirvikalpa.\nQ. What is meant by Rama?=\r\n\nA. That in which everything takes its origin, exists and disappears, is\nRa=\r\nma.\n\nI then determined that all practices are only means to attain this fin=\r\nal\nstage. I was giving up my former spiritual practices little by little. I=\r\n\nfelt immensely attracted to Bhagavan and felt quite at home in Ramanasrmam=\r\n.\nBhagavan was all love. After meeting Bhagavan I did not go to any other\nG=\r\nuru.\n\nI then read the life of Maharshi. By reading it one acquires vairagya=\r\nm and\ndispassion. Just to see him is upadesam; to sit in his presence gives=\r\n peace.\nThis is my firm belief.\n\nAfter some time, with Bhagavan&#39;s permissio=\r\nn, I went back to my native place.\nI would come twice every year to see him=\r\n.\n\nHe had composed &quot;Upadesa Saram&quot; in Tamil. I prayed that he might transla=\r\nte\nit into Telugu. He rendered it in dwipada (couplets) form in Telugu. I t=\r\nhen\nstayed in the Asramam for some days, went abroad for some time, and the=\r\nn\nreturned to my Asramam. I then gave up everything. When I returned to\nTir=\r\nuvannamalai I would sometimes stay in the Mango Tree Cave near Mulaipal\nThi=\r\nrtham.\n\nAfter Bhagavan had composed &quot;Ulladu Narpadu&quot; in Tamil (.Reality in =\r\nForty\nVerses.), I prayed to him to teach it to me in Telegu. He rendered it=\r\n into\nTelegu prose and taught it to me. Reflecting on what he taught me the=\r\n mind\nwas subdued and dissolved in the Self.Now nothing different from Self=\r\n is\nseen.\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2008/?pg=3Djul-aug=\r\n#article.1\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =\r\n =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd11a1ae9b9790483775e6c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;B.
