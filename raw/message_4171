Some of them are meaningful=\r\n to an extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millenn=\r\nia by intellectuals.\n\nHowever, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for =\r\nthe pleasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.\n\nT=\r\nhere are some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam ev=\r\neryday as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these tech=\r\nnicalities.\n\n* * *\n\nIf Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to =\r\nheavens (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on=\r\n earth. You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow=\r\n of signals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all =\r\ntimes. Even during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certain=\r\nly capable of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and ma=\r\nking them reach various deities.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want to get your father (or=\r\n mother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may=\r\n want to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not=\r\n tired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course=\r\n, even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your=\r\n father may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such age=\r\nndas and only want to tell your father &quot;I love you&quot; and take whatever he gi=\r\nves, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favor=\r\ned by parents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to g=\r\nive.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are s=\r\neveral technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you=\r\n may not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many c=\r\norruptions in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of gettin=\r\ng specific material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best app=\r\nroach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express you=\r\nr love and surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad.=\r\n Such a person will be favored by deities over the long run.\n\n* * *\n\nNamast=\r\ne Ramakishore,\n\nDifferent points of space and different points of time have=\r\n a different quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana =\r\nin Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the sam=\r\ne as sadhana on Pournima.\n\nIf one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally =\r\n(e.g. a monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly=\r\n Krishna homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned wi=\r\nth the energy of that deity.\n\nHowever, one can only make so much progress w=\r\nith occasional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, m=\r\nore intense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra=\r\n/deity, one can do it every day and at all times.\n\n* * *\n\nA lot of beggars =\r\nmay be standing at the gate of a king&#39;s palace, waiting for the king to see=\r\n them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king =\r\nmay be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so=\r\n and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gat=\r\ne on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many =\r\nbeggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the =\r\nother hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king&#39;s eyes may fall =\r\non you someday!\n\nHave the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, kee=\r\np doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity&#39;s gra=\r\nce. That is a sureshot formula for success.\n\n* * *\n\nThe issue of auspicious=\r\n days and times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more=\r\n auspicious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For exampl=\r\ne, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to =\r\ngo there and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, G=\r\nambhir and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you m=\r\nay still get out cheaply.\n\nInstead of helping, sadhana done on a particular=\r\nly good day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I r=\r\nemember one incident.\n\nA few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I w=\r\nanted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for t=\r\nhe whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anythin=\r\ng like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned i=\r\nt to Manish and he said, &quot;excellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated with Gayatri ma=\r\nntra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute break=\r\ns and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day.=\r\n When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.\n\nNext morning, I real=\r\nized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, bir=\r\nthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said th=\r\nat spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective =\r\nthan a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened t=\r\no be an auspicious day.\n\nI mentioned it to Manish. He said, &quot;I knew it was =\r\nAkshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me&quot;. I asked him w=\r\nhy he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;knowing you were d=\r\noing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have i=\r\nnstead distracted you.&quot;\n\nHe was right. As such, I was a little &quot;proud&quot; of t=\r\nhe sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement=\r\n and expectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted=\r\n my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadh=\r\nana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of usel=\r\ness excitement would&#39;ve been higher and distracted me even more!\n\nBottomlin=\r\ne: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of y=\r\nour mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excite=\r\nment and expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and p=\r\natiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foo=\r\nlproof strategy.

But what really matters is the state=\r\n of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create e=\r\nxcitement and expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday =\r\nand patiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and mor=\r\ne foolproof strategy.
