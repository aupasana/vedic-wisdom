The proud and the avaricious m=\r\nan are never\nat rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the\nmultit=\r\nude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self,\nis soon tempted,=\r\n and is overcome in small and trifling matters.\nIt is hard for him who is w=\r\neak in spirit, and still in part\ncarnal and inclined to the pleasures of se=\r\nnse, to withdraw\nhimself altogether from earthly desires.  And therefore, w=\r\nhen he\nwithdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily\nangered =\r\ntoo if any oppose his will.\n\n2. But if, on the other hand, he yield to his =\r\ninclination,\nimmediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his\ncons=\r\ncience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in\nno way attaine=\r\nd the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of\nheart is to be found in =\r\nresisting passion, not in yielding to it.\nAnd therefore there is no peace i=\r\nn the heart of a man who is\ncarnal, nor in him who is given up to the thing=\r\ns that are without\nhim, but only in him who is fervent towards God and livi=\r\nng the\nlife of the Spirit.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOf fleeing from vain hope and pri=\r\nde\n\nVain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in\nany cre=\r\nated Thing.  Be not ashamed to be the servant of others\nfor the love of Jes=\r\nus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this\nlife.  Rest not upon thyself, bu=\r\nt build thy hope in God.  Do what\nlieth in thy power, and God will help thy=\r\n good intent. Trust not\nin thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that =\r\nlives, but\nrather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and\ng=\r\niveth grace to the humble.\n\n2. Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast=\r\n them, nor in thy\nfriends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all t=\r\nhings,\nand in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself.  Be\nnot=\r\n lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with\nonly a sligh=\r\nt sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain\nof thy skilfulness or=\r\n ability, lest thou displease God, from\nwhom cometh every good gift which w=\r\ne have.\n\n3. Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou\nappea=\r\nr worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  Be\nnot proud of t=\r\nhy good works, for God&#39;s judgments are of another\nsort than the judgments o=\r\nf man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes\ndispleasing to Him.  If thou hast =\r\nany good, believe that others\nhave more, and so thou mayest preserve thy hu=\r\nmility. It is no\nharm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but i=\r\nt is\ngreat harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Peace is ever\nwith t=\r\nhe humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is\nenvy and continual wr=\r\nath.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOf the danger of too much familiarity\n\nOpen not thine =\r\nheart to every man, but deal with one who is wise\nand feareth God. Be seldo=\r\nm with the young and with strangers.  Be\nnot a flatterer of the rich; nor w=\r\nillingly seek the society of\nthe great.  Let thy company be the humble and =\r\nthe simple, the\ndevout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning =\r\nthings\nwhich edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good\nw=\r\nomen alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His\nAngels only, an=\r\nd flee from the notice of men.\n\n2. We must love all men, but not make close=\r\n companions of all.\nIt sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us =\r\nis highly\nregarded through good report of him, whose actual person is\nnever=\r\ntheless unpleasing to those who behold it.  We sometimes\nthink to please ot=\r\nhers by our intimacy, and forthwith displease\nthem the more by the faultine=\r\nss of character which they perceive\nin us.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nOf obedience and s=\r\nubjection\n\nIt is verily a great thing to live in obedience, to be under\naut=\r\nhority, and not to be at our own disposal.  Far safer is it to\nlive in subj=\r\nection than in a place of authority.  Many are in\nobedience from necessity =\r\nrather than from love; these take it\namiss, and repine for small cause.  No=\r\nr will they gain freedom of\nspirit, unless with all their heart they submit=\r\n themselves for\nthe love of God.  Though thou run hither and thither, thou =\r\nwilt\nnot find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him\nwho =\r\nis set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them\nhave deceived ma=\r\nny.\n\n2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent,\nand is =\r\nthe more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if\nChrist is amongst us=\r\n, then it is necessary that we sometimes\nyield up our own opinion for the s=\r\nake of peace.  Who is so wise\nas to have perfect knowledge of all things?  =\r\nTherefore trust not\ntoo much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hea=\r\nr the\nopinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for\nthe=\r\n love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another,\nthou shalt t=\r\nhe more profit thereby.\n\n3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to heark=\r\nen and to\nreceive counsel than to give it.  It may also come to pass that\ne=\r\nach opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others when\nreason or =\r\noccasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or\nwilfulness.\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOf th=\r\ne danger of superfluity of words\n\nAvoid as far as thou canst the tumult of =\r\nmen; for talk concerning\nworldly things, though it be innocently undertaken=\r\n, is a\nhindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity.\nMany=\r\n a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone\namongst men.  But=\r\n why do we talk and gossip so continually,\nseeing that we so rarely resume =\r\nour silence without some hurt\ndone to our conscience?  We like talking so m=\r\nuch because we hope\nby our conversations to gain some mutual comfort, and b=\r\necause we\nseek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts.  And\n=\r\nwe very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or\ndesire, o=\r\nr else of those which we most dislike.\n\n2. But alas! it is often to no purp=\r\nose and in vain.  For this\noutward consolation is no small hindrance to the=\r\n inner comfort\nwhich cometh from God.  Therefore must we watch and pray tha=\r\nt\ntime pass not idly away.  If it be right and desirable for thee\nto speak,=\r\n speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and\nneglect of our rea=\r\nl profit tend much to make us heedless of\nwatching over our lips.  Neverthe=\r\nless, devout conversation on\nspiritual things helpeth not a little to spiri=\r\ntual progress, most\nof all where those of kindred mind and spirit find thei=\r\nr ground\nof fellowship in God.\n\n\n\n"}}
