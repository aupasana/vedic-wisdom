Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Jus=\r\nt like \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw v=\r\negetables as well. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human society. \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look =\r\nat REAL \n&gt;&gt; research in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scient=\r\nific papers in \n\n&gt;&gt; clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 jun=\r\ne/july, you would find \n\n&gt;&gt; ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for m=\r\nany milleniums have relied on an \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; omnivorous diet:-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; a) Human  =\r\nancestral diets changed substantially approximately four to five \n&gt;&gt; millio=\r\nn years ago with major climatic changes creating open grassland \n&gt;&gt; environ=\r\nments. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller=\r\n, simpler \n&gt;&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82  requiring=C3=82 foods based aro=\r\nund meat protein and fat. \n&gt;&gt;For \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; example since the time of Australop=\r\nithecus afarensis, some four to five million \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; years ago, brain size h=\r\nas increased threefold - chemical requirement for \n&gt;&gt; long-chain polyunsatu=\r\nrated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a \n&gt;&gt; corresponding increase=\r\n in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with \n&gt;&gt;a \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; diet t=\r\nhat is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain \n&gt;&gt; w=\r\nould not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it not been for=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; c) The gut=\r\n  morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally \n&gt;&gt; equidistan=\r\nt from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because \n&gt;&gt; humans=\r\n are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nrumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82 major part of the l=\r\neafy \n&gt;&gt;vegetable \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the =\r\nother hand, the stomach \n&gt;&gt;lining \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82  th=\r\ne kind of strong acids which is present in a \n&gt;&gt;typical \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; carnivore. T=\r\nhis is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82  the natural \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may further inte=\r\nrest you \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to know that the teeth structure of humans is actually ident=\r\nical to, guess \n&gt;&gt;what, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; d) It ma=\r\ny shock many a preconcieved and  mistaken ideas that=C3=82 research into \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the =\r\nhuman \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; body for=C3=82 w.r.t different foods=C3=82 is highest (not vege=\r\ntables or fruits) for \n&gt;&gt;fish, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. =\r\nInfact the later is considered negative \n&gt;&gt; calorie food, since it requires=\r\n the body to waste more calories in absorving it \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; than the amount it =\r\ngains from them.

Human body is naturally su=\r\nited for an omnivorous diet. Just like &lt;br&gt;&gt; people do not eat raw meat,=\r\n normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. &lt;br&gt;&gt; Cooking is a =\r\nlater addition to human society. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; If you were to =\r\nclear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL &lt;br&gt;&gt; researc=\r\nh in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scientific papers in &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you wou=\r\nld find &lt;br&gt;&gt; ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleni=\r\nums have relied on an &lt;br&gt;&gt; omnivorous diet:-&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; a) Human\n=\r\n ancestral diets changed substantially approximately four to five &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nmillion years ago with major climatic changes creating open grassland &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; environments. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; b) Humans developed a larger b=\r\nrain balanced by a smaller, simpler &lt;br&gt;&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp; requiring=C3=82&nbsp;foods based around meat protein and fat. For &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; example since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to fiv=\r\ne million &lt;br&gt;&gt; years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical=\r\n requirement for &lt;br&gt;&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in t=\r\nhe brain - without a &lt;br&gt;&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic=\r\n Rate. This is possible only with a &lt;br&gt;&gt; diet that is rich is animal pr=\r\notein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain &lt;br&gt;&gt; would not have reach=\r\ned the size and mass as it is today, had it not been for &lt;br&gt;&gt; diet comp=\r\nrising of meat, fruits and vegetables. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; c) The gu=\r\nt\n morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally &lt;br&gt;&gt; equi=\r\ndistant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; humans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caec=\r\num and &lt;br&gt;&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body t=\r\no absorve plant &lt;br&gt;&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;major part of the leafy vegetable &lt;br&gt;&gt; based diet eventually e=\r\nnds up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining &lt;br&gt;&gt; of human=\r\ns do not contain=C3=82&nbsp; the kind of strong acids which is present in a=\r\n typical &lt;br&gt;&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature=\r\n through=C3=82&nbsp; the natural &lt;br&gt;&gt; process of evolution is supposed =\r\nto be omnivorous. It may further interest you &lt;br&gt;&gt; to know that the tee=\r\nth structure of humans is actually identical to, guess what, &lt;br&gt;&gt; rats =\r\nwho also are omnivores.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieve=\r\nd and\n mistaken ideas that=C3=82&nbsp;research into &lt;br&gt;&gt; clinical nutri=\r\ntion very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human &lt;br&gt;&gt; b=\r\nody for=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t different foods=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (not vegetab=\r\nles or fruits) for fish, &lt;br&gt;&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infa=\r\nct the later is considered negative &lt;br&gt;&gt; calorie food, since it require=\r\ns the body to waste more calories in absorving it &lt;br&gt;&gt; than the amount =\r\nit gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. You can &lt;br&gt;&gt; look=\r\n up actual BV (biological value)=C3=82&nbsp;charts for more details.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; All this is science.

So not only heart that is affected in non veg &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\neaters but also sexual reproduction system. this is surprising since non ve=\r\ng &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;foods are supposed to make men more rajasic and active. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;2) for the last 10 years at least the ch=\r\nemicals are being used increasingly to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;make the animals more h=\r\neavier and tasty after cooking. accordingly even fish, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;prawns,=\r\n chickens, goats, buffalo are all being fed with food that would make &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;them grow faster and to make their flesh tastier.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;3) people all over the world are ignoring such facts to their own\n =\r\nperil.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;I am a born vegetarian and i do not know th=\r\ne facts about non veg foods.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Can someone explain t=\r\nhe facts?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks to everyone,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Rajmohan=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1779582267-1291137422=:40770--\r\n\n"}}
