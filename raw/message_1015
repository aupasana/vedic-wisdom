The role of\n&gt; &gt; ishta devata \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is to give moksha. Moksha is the=\r\n state of non-distinction between\n&gt; &gt; objects of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; universe. &quot;Supreme =\r\ncosmic being&quot; (known by various names) is the\n&gt; &gt; observer of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all wi=\r\nth non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Several deities \n&gt; play \n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npecific roles in the universe at the lower level and become one \n&gt; with \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; supreme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, one may start\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npraying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to a specific form of a deity with a specific role in the \n&gt;=\r\n universe,\n&gt; &gt; later \n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize a higher form of the deity and then bec=\r\nome liberated \n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; higher form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For this=\r\n reason, some (especially some gurus at Sri Jagannath\n&gt; &gt; Centre) even \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; say that only Vishnu&#39;s incarnations can be ishta devatas giving\n&gt; &gt; moks=\r\nha and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other deities cannot be. This is partly logical, but based on=\r\n a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; misconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-\n&gt; =\r\npervading \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or=\r\n Surya \n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too =\r\nthat form qualifies as \n&gt; ishta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; devata who enables moksha (liberatio=\r\nn). For example, Ganapathi \n&gt; Atharva \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seersham describes a supreme c=\r\nosmic being form of Ganapathi, from \n&gt; whom \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva=\r\n come. Suryopanishat describes a supreme \n&gt; cosmic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being form of Sur=\r\nya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva come. And \n&gt; so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One =\r\nmay start with the worship of Ganesha who removes obstacles \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; fina=\r\nlly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize a form of Ganesha that is beyond gunas and from whom \n&gt; =\r\nBrahma,\n&gt; &gt; Vishnu, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva, Surya, Agni, Vaayu etc are born. One may =\r\nstart with the\n&gt; &gt; worship of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lakshmi who gives prosperity and money=\r\n and finally realize a form \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who drives the thought=\r\ns and actions of all beings. One may start\n&gt; &gt; with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; worship of S=\r\naraswati who gives knowledge and finally realize a \n&gt; form of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sarasw=\r\nati who is the root of all creation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, one starts worshipp=\r\ning one&#39;s ishta devata and slowly \n&gt; evolves to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping a higher=\r\n all-pervading form of that deity, who may\n&gt; &gt; sometimes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem like a=\r\n different deity to a casual observer. This is the \n&gt; natural \n&gt; &gt; &gt; proces=\r\ns of evolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Saptashati ra=\r\nhasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) \n&gt; describes\n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nrocess of creation. It says that first there was Mahalakshmi with\n&gt; &gt; three=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gunas. She divided herself into 3 parts - Mahakali with tamas \n&gt; (i=\r\nchchhaa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - the force behind desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (j=\r\nnaana\n&gt; &gt; sakti - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the force behind knowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kri=\r\nyaa sakti - the \n&gt; force \n&gt; &gt; &gt; behind action) with rajas. The 3 parts of C=\r\nhandipath are devoted \n&gt; to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; three.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, trigunatmi=\r\nka Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires/thoughts, know=\r\nledge/perception and actions of all beings \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; universe.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath prays to Dev=\r\ni \n&gt; (divine \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother) after all her exploits and addresses Her in the=\r\n prayer as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Naaraayani&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraayan=\r\na as\n&gt; &gt; supreme cosmic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva cam=\r\ne, trigunatmika\n&gt; &gt; Mahalakshami (or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narayani) is his energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the Divine Mother of Chandipath is not really different \n&gt; fro=\r\nm \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahalakshmi I have been worshipping for many years. I originally\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; started out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping Lakshmi with 4 hands who sita on a lotus =\r\nand gives \n&gt; money. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; later realized that a higher form of the same =\r\ndeity is the energy \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narayana (supreme cosmic being) and She is=\r\n responsible for the \n&gt; birth, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sustenance and destruction of all bei=\r\nngs including Brahma, Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; and Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whichever deity you are attached to and worship as your isht=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; devata, please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; try to imagine that deity as the all-pervading =\r\nsupreme cosmic \n&gt; being\n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; whom the entire creation evolves.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.ho=\r\nme.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; =\r\n&lt;rajarshi14@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday=\r\n, January 15, 2009 11:44 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on Istha=\r\n devata to Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n was reading up on the old mail about how your started doign \n&gt; Chandi\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Homa.
