At one moment i am sweet\nlittle thing, at another, a terrible mon=\r\nster, because of variety of\ngratifications of my physical demands of lusts,=\r\n mental demands for\nemotional satisfactions and because of my perturbed int=\r\nellect, tossed by\nits endless mischievous thoughts. somehow, I am aware of =\r\nall this. Yet I\ncannot get out of it. Why this helpless bondage? All this p=\r\nernicious\nsorrows arise because I, the Atman, misunderstand myself to  be t=\r\nhe\nnot-Self (an-atman).\n\nSuppose in a drunken mood you misunderstand yourse=\r\nlf to be your own\nshadow. Terrible suffering must then start for you. You f=\r\nind that you\nare lying down on the road, and the traffic is incessantly pas=\r\nsing over\nyou. Your head is sometimes in the filthy, way-side gutter.  You =\r\nrefuse\nto move because you are being dargged. Thus, all the sufferings of t=\r\nhe\nShadow become your sufferings. A simple misunderstanding that you are\nyo=\r\nur shadow becomes the source of a chain of terrible sufferings.\n\nSimilarly,=\r\n the misunderstanding, &quot;I am the anatman&quot;, is the spring-board\nfor all bond=\r\nages and limitations that are suffered in voiceless agony by\nour personalit=\r\ny. To end this misunderstanding would be redeeming at once\nour personality =\r\nfrom the encrustations of matter and its tyranny. One\nwho is released from =\r\nthe tyrannies of matter is  a God-man on\nearth--Perfect, free, liberated to=\r\ntally from the weaknesses which\ncharacterise a mortal.\n\nGOD, apparently suf=\r\nering the sorrows of persecuting matter is man\n(human)\n\n     In the dream w=\r\nhen i forget my real nature, I identify with the\nthings projected by me in =\r\nthe dream and suffer the consequences. The\nsufferings of the dream last onl=\r\ny till i wake up. The moment i wake up\nand realise my real nature, all the =\r\nsorrows of the dream end. When in a\ndrunken state i forget my real nature, =\r\ni keepthe wrong relationship with\nthe world around me, and consequently, i =\r\ncome to suffer. A mad man,\nbecause of some psycological changes in him, for=\r\ngets himself, and start\nbehaving wrongly in the world around him. In the sa=\r\nme manner I, who am\nGod, the Paramatman, the pure self, not understanding m=\r\nyself, in the\nNon-apprehension of my real nature, start creating misapprehe=\r\nnsions.\nThen, identifying myself with the not-self, which i am not, i come =\r\nto\nsuffer the pains of existence created by myself for myself.\n\nThis identi=\r\nfication with the not-Self in each one of us is the cause of\nour life&#39;s suf=\r\nferings. In a cinema-hall, we identify ourselves with the\nhero or the heroi=\r\nne on the screen.
