Others answered your questions and I will leav=\r\ne them. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on ag=\r\nhora seems to have created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand=\r\n when we are communicating verbally, because one&#39;s own mental conditioning =\r\nhas a role in deciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-te=\r\nxt. It is more so when we are talking about delicate matters.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3. When the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, is it really=\r\n needed\n&gt; &gt; to perform &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Brah=\r\nmacharya is very important in any spiritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan sai=\r\nd, sexual activity results in loss of ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a p=\r\nart of one&#39;s creative essence. Doing sadhana without brahmacharya is like f=\r\nilling a water pot that is leaking through a hole. Even if you succeed in f=\r\nilling the pot with water, it will soon become empty!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just as a fille=\r\nd water pot that is leaking may still satisfy the thirst of someone who tak=\r\nes a glass of water from it, similarly a person doing sadhana without brahm=\r\nacharya may sometimes be able to do his dharma and serve his purpose in the=\r\n world. So, it is a good idea to do sadhana even as one&#39;s brahmacharya is n=\r\not good yet. But, the best will be if the filled water pot is not leaking a=\r\nnd holds all the water. Similarly, a sadhaka who is accumulating some shakt=\r\ni through sadhana and does not leak that energy through acts of lust, anger=\r\n, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serve dharma better.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If there ar=\r\ne 12 people who maintain physical and mental brahmacharya for a few years w=\r\nhile doing homam everyday, I think the world can be changed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If an aghora sits naked with partner and chants mantra, p=\r\nlease remember that the goal isn&#39;t having sex. This practice is by means a =\r\nglorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*. Even if the mind is overwhel=\r\nmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the goal is to=\r\n reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy as someth=\r\ning to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahmacharya ca=\r\nn be maintained despite such provocation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, the true meaning o=\r\nf brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to refrain=\r\n from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be able=\r\n to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain physi=\r\ncal brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain from men=\r\ntal thoughts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; An aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those t=\r\nhoughts in his mind (what Manish called as &quot;sampradaaha&quot;). Mind considers s=\r\nome things as pure and some things as impure. The &quot;impure&quot; objects and circ=\r\numstances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other dis=\r\nturbance to the mind and waver it from god. But an aghora puts them right i=\r\nn the middle of a &quot;pure&quot; activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to dea=\r\nl with them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill or=\r\n other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impu=\r\nre! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure a=\r\nbout it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind a=\r\nnd waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, what=\r\n is impure about it?\n&gt;  \n&gt; That is the basic thinking in this practice. Som=\r\ne yogis may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to=\r\n opposite sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in fron=\r\nt of a naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, h=\r\nis mind may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to inci=\r\nnerate the very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be =\r\naroused by, not by staying away from it but by being with it and yet trying=\r\n to focus the mind on god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: An aghora engaging in this pra=\r\nctice may stray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to atta=\r\nin more perfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to atta=\r\nin brahmacharya.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning o=\r\nf sadhana, it may be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to som=\r\nehow or the other attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The coarse meaning of brahmacharya is phys=\r\nical celibacy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The finer meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy=\r\n and refraining from any sexual thoughts even in the mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The finest=\r\n meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust, anger, greed, delusion, w=\r\nantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in Brahman always. Brahmacharya=\r\n literally means &quot;engaging in Brahman or Self&quot;. One experiences lust, anger=\r\n, greed, jealosy etc only when one&#39;s mind perceives and engages with imperm=\r\nanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful lady, a bad person, a lot of=\r\n money, a person being appreciated more than me etc) and NOT when one&#39;s min=\r\nd engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmacharya comes only on Self-rea=\r\nlization. But one can start with physical celibacy and control over anger.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rome is not built in a day.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: It is very important to=\r\n keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. Start off with som=\r\ne level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes on. Never be fru=\r\nstrated with lack of progress and keep trying.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; BTW, regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire w=\r\nill be burning in the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there co=\r\nnsuming your offerings, even after it seems like there is no fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ke=\r\nep it as cheap as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fall=\r\nen wood sticks collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote: \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; NAMASKAR to all\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama for the=\r\n last three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of th=\r\nis beautiful forum...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now I need some practical approach best suit=\r\nable for me...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.
