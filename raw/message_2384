All children, especially\ngirls, worship Sita. The=\r\n height of a woman&#39;s ambition is to be like Sita,\nthe pure, the devoted, th=\r\ne all-suffering! When you study these characters,\nyou can at once find out =\r\nhow different is the ideal in India from that of\nthe West. For the race, Si=\r\nta stands as the ideal of suffering.\n\nThe West says, &quot;Do! Show your power b=\r\ny doing.&quot; India says, &quot;Show your power\nby suffering.&quot; The West has solved t=\r\nhe problem of how much a man can have:\nIndia has solved the problem of how =\r\nlittle a man can have. The two extremes,\nyou see. Sita is typical of India =\r\n=97 the idealised India. The question is not\nwhether she ever lived, whethe=\r\nr the story is history or not, we know that\nthe ideal is there. There is no=\r\n other Paur=E2nika story that has so permeated\nthe whole nation, so entered=\r\n into its very life, and has so tingled in every\ndrop of blood of the race,=\r\n as this ideal of Sita.\n\nSita is the name in India for everything that is g=\r\nood, pure and holy =97\neverything that in woman we call womanly. If a pries=\r\nt has to bless a woman\nhe says, &quot;Be Sita!&quot; If he blesses a child, he says &quot;=\r\nBe Sita!&quot; They are all\nchildren of Sita, and are struggling to be Sita, the=\r\n patient, the\nall-suffering, the ever-faithful, the ever-pure wife. Through=\r\n all this\nsuffering she experiences, there is not one harsh word against Ra=\r\nma. She\ntakes it as her own duty, and performs her own part in it. Think of=\r\n the\nterrible injustice of her being exiled to the forest! But Sita knows n=\r\no\nbitterness. That is, again, the Indian ideal. Says the ancient Buddha, &quot;W=\r\nhen\na man hurts you, and you turn back to hurt him, that would not cure the=\r\n\nfirst injury; it would only create in the world one more wickedness.&quot; Sita=\r\n\nwas a true Indian by nature; she never returned injury.\n\nWho knows which i=\r\ns the truer ideal? The apparent power and strength, as held\nin the West, or=\r\n the fortitude in suffering, of the East?\n\nThe West says, &quot;We minimise evil=\r\n by conquering it.&quot; India says, &quot;We destroy\nevil by suffering, until evil i=\r\ns nothing to us, it becomes positive\nenjoyment.&quot; Well, both are great ideal=\r\ns. Who knows which will survive in the\nlong run? Who knows which attitude w=\r\nill really most benefit humanity? Who\nknows which will disarm and conquer a=\r\nnimality? Will it be suffering, or\ndoing?\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanay=\r\na\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb57b857f96a0472581ad9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE RAMAYANA (D=\r\nelivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, January 31, 1900)&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Volume 4, Lectures and Disc=\r\nourses&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rama and Sita are the ideals of the Indian nation. =\r\nAll children, especially girls, worship Sita.=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:=\r\nbold&quot;&gt;The height of a woman&#39;s ambition is to be like Sita, the pure, th=\r\ne devoted, the all-suffering!&lt;/span&gt;=A0When you study these characters, you=\r\n can at once find out how different is the ideal in India from that of the =\r\nWest.
