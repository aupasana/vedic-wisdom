Do you know him as a friend and is he a In=\r\ndian? What sort of\n&gt; path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyasin or a =\r\nhouseholder ?Did\n&gt; specific changes happened in his life after  he had thes=\r\ne samadhi and\n&gt; visions.Any other special things about him.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; **\n&gt; Ye=\r\ns he is a friend of mine.  I can only tell you very little about his\n&gt; spir=\r\nitual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is married,\n&gt; =\r\nlives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before I tell you anything more a=\r\nbout his spiritual life that I know, let\n&gt; me say line or two about the nat=\r\nure of this friend of mine. I met him about\n&gt; two years back. What first at=\r\ntracted me to  towards him was his impeccable\n&gt; honestly. I mean, he is a m=\r\naniac when it comes to honestly. If someone were\n&gt; to put a gun to his head=\r\n and ask him to just say a simple, harmless lie,\n&gt; like sun rises in the we=\r\nst, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes\n&gt; with anyone too! He has=\r\n actually never ever spoken even a single lie in his\n&gt; whole life, big or s=\r\nmall. When he was in his school, once his teacher told\n&gt; him that Indian la=\r\nnguages are richer than English, he believed his teacher.\n&gt; Later someone e=\r\nlse told him English is more comprehensive language and the\n&gt; world cannot =\r\ndo with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself\n&gt; two thick =\r\nfat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every\n&gt; day he s=\r\npend one hour reading the English dictionary and one hour reading\n&gt; the Hin=\r\ndi dictionary apart from reading up volumes of Hindi and English\n&gt; literatu=\r\nre. When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to\n&gt; be equa=\r\nlly adept at both the languages so that one day he can take a really\n&gt; deta=\r\nched view to judge the truth about which is more comprehensive language!\n&gt; =\r\nAs I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out\n&gt;=\r\n the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has=\r\n\n&gt; worked in different fields, from banking to education to journalism. He =\r\ndid\n&gt; not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, Engl=\r\nish,\n&gt; Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is l=\r\nearning\n&gt; Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he was=\r\n in\n&gt; college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a job h=\r\ne had\n&gt; kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk who wa=\r\ns\n&gt; supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked my friend&#39;s n=\r\name.\n&gt; Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my frien=\r\nd\n&gt; snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Because, h=\r\ne\n&gt; considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would have =\r\nbeen\n&gt; a lie.\n&gt;\n&gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. A=\r\nll his friends,\n&gt; whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt;\n&gt; One da=\r\ny, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way\n&gt; to =\r\noffice passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in his scooter,\n&gt; s=\r\nuddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still does=\r\n\n&gt; not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o cloc=\r\nk in\n&gt; the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! =\r\nAnd he\n&gt; has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, t=\r\nhe priest\n&gt; said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as h=\r\ne was for the\n&gt; whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt sc=\r\nared to disturb\n&gt; him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He reme=\r\nmbered nothing, as\n&gt; if he was in deep sleep.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then he started meditatin=\r\ng at home, and it was there that he got visions\n&gt; etc of Krishna. He does n=\r\not say much about these, infact most people who\n&gt; know him also do not know=\r\n these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72\n&gt; hours, not moving from h=\r\nis meditation seat, in the exact same place and same\n&gt; position for 3 days =\r\ncontinuously. Only his wife and close relatives know\n&gt; about this incident.=\r\n I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he\n&gt; often enters the =\r\nstate of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during\n&gt; samadhi, he j=\r\nust said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I\n&gt; am the su=\r\nn, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women,\n&gt; children, t=\r\nhe wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger\n&gt; than ever=\r\nything. It cannot be accurately desribed. He considers Sri Krishna\n&gt; to be =\r\nGod and Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the\n&gt; Ra=\r\nmacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri Rama to the level of a\n&gt; G=\r\nod whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as\n=\r\n&gt; an ideal *man, *not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is=\r\n\n&gt; someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to becom=\r\ne\n&gt; like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One canno=\r\nt\n&gt; become Krishna, but one can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argu=\r\ned\n&gt; with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not=\r\n have\n&gt; a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust mos=\r\nt Gurus\n&gt; these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt;\n&gt; L=\r\nater he had once mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the people\n=\r\n&gt; around him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his=\r\n\n&gt; past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on different internet fo=\r\nrums\n&gt; interacting with people, specially with those in the age group of 18=\r\n to 30,\n&gt; discussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politic=\r\ns to Indian\n&gt; history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowl=\r\nedge to young\n&gt; people who will be the future of this country.\n&gt;\n&gt; He is am=\r\n omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I shal=\r\nl refrain from mentioning his name because I had not asked his\n&gt; permission=\r\n before mentioning him.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: I would not like t=\r\nhis mail to be considered as a part of the debate.\n&gt; This mail is just beca=\r\nuse Laxmi Narayan asked for information.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt; The upsurge (of consci=\r\nousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Mon, 14/12/09, Laxmi N=\r\narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shri=\r\njishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

Simple dal/roti and do not even touch onion/gar=\r\nlic/\n&gt; pepper but no such samadhi?\n&gt;\n&gt; When we get burnt, we need to be car=\r\neful.Many years ago I saw in a\n&gt; book/article  about Dayamata who succeded =\r\n Paramhansa Yoganand.

No=\r\n outright solutions for so many difficult\n&gt; questions. Followers of 3 faith=\r\ns which all originated in middle east are\n&gt; fighting each other all the tim=\r\ne. Sometimes I think, from which part of\n&gt; Spiritual Sky these energies are=\r\n coming,Are they also enemies there?? Their\n&gt; Gods said in their holy books=\r\n that animals are their food. So they cannot\n&gt; even think about souls in an=\r\nimals or their pain and emotions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I have read stories about severa=\r\nl people, who follow these faiths and\n&gt; are non-veg and how they exexperien=\r\nce  spiritual highs and other such\n&gt; phenomena.

Do you know him as a f=\r\nriend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he following?? Is he=\r\n a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his life af=\r\nter=A0 he had these samadhi and visions.Any other special things about him.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the Gita Lord is saying whatever you do/eat offer it to me fir=\r\nst. So he is offering all these non-veg to Lord with devotion, Right?? Then=\r\n prasdam all around??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My curious questions are not against your acce=\r\nptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is\n part of hidden =\r\nviolence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome=A0 pain and misery on animals and=\r\n birds on his behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is experiencing al=\r\nl these exotic=A0 visions, But no feeling of kindness towards birds and ani=\r\nmals.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Where did I go wrong? Simple dal/roti and do not even touch =\r\nonion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we get burnt, we nee=\r\nd to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/article=A0 about Dayamata wh=\r\no succeded=A0 Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she went to India and told a Spirit=\r\nual Master that her progress has stopped. Master said, you are eating eggs =\r\nwhich she admitted that she was doing=A0 secretly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is very co=\r\nmplex world. No outright solutions for so many difficult questions. Followe=\r\nrs of 3 faiths which all originated in middle east are fighting each other =\r\nall the time. Sometimes I think, from which part of Spiritual Sky these ene=\r\nrgies are coming,Are they also enemies\n there?? Their Gods said in their ho=\r\nly books that animals are their food. So they cannot even think about souls=\r\n in animals or their pain and emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I have read stories abo=\r\nut several people, who follow these faiths and are non-veg and how they exe=\r\nxperience=A0 spiritual highs and other such phenomena. It is so difficult t=\r\no comprehend.=A0 Would they remain in the cycle of b/d=A0 till they learn a=\r\nbout kindness???&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Kind Regards&lt;br&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-=\r\n-- On Sat, 12/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. &lt;a href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/co.in&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;co.in&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockqu=\r\note&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; \nThe INTERNET n=\r\now has a personality.
