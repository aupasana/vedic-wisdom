But there are still som=\r\ne questions for me that I seem not to get any answers:-\n\n1. Are the macro e=\r\nvents in world history pre-determined ? Like world wars for example.....\n\n2=\r\n. We all know that Yugas are predetermined and the human intelligence (awar=\r\neness) goes down as we move from Satya Yuga to Kali Yuga...So the question =\r\nis at what macro level are events predetermined over which Humans have no c=\r\nontrol.\n\n3. There is a quote - &quot;If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try aga=\r\nin. Then quit. There&#39;s no point in being a damn fool about it.&quot;. Suppose on=\r\ne wants to be a doctor (he has the vasana inclination) and he tries repeate=\r\ndly to clear the entrance test and he fails. At what point of time should h=\r\ne realise that he should stop attempting and look for an alternative profes=\r\nsion..? Is his profession predetermined that he should not become a doctor,=\r\n but a chemist for example?\n\nIn my view the macro world events are pre-dete=\r\nrmined while humans have a free will over micro events...Let me try a crude=\r\n analogy:- The shape of race track and wind conditions are pre-determined a=\r\nnd the racer has no control over them (Macro events), while the obstacles (=\r\nMicro events) one encounters are under control. In the sense that a stone i=\r\ns easier to jump over but a huge boulder is difficult to jump over. But if =\r\none puts in sufficient effort it is still possible to jump over a huge boul=\r\nder.\n\nWhat is the reference point at which events are macro and micro is so=\r\nmething I have not understood still.For eg: Can a huge boulder on the race =\r\ntrack be a macro event or a micro event?\n\nRegards\nRam\n\n\n\n__________________=\r\n______________\n From: priyank_priyank &lt;aks_day@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com \nSent: Friday, December 23, 2011 1:25 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] The Riddle of Fate and Free-Will Solved\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste all, \n\nSha=\r\nring an excellent article, it covers a lot more than what the title suggest=\r\n.

I only stated=\r\n the problem and did not even explain how I find it to be a difficult one.\n=\r\nH.H. : Your difficulty arises in the very statement of the problem. D. : Ho=\r\nw?\nH.H. : A conflict arises only if there are two things. There can be no c=\r\nonflict if there is only one thing.\nD. : But here there are two things, fat=\r\ne and free-will.\nH.H. : Exacly. It is this assumption of yours that is resp=\r\nonsible for your problem.\nD. : It is not my assumption at all. How can I ig=\r\nnore the fact that the two things exist as independent factors, whether I g=\r\nrant their existence or not?\nH.H. : That is where you are wrong again.\nD. :=\r\n How?\n\nH.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you must know that fate=\r\n is nothing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum total of the results o=\r\nf your past actions. As God is but the dispenser of the fruits of actions, =\r\nfate, representing those fruits, is not his creation but only yours. Free-w=\r\nill is what you exercise when you act now.\n\nD. : Still I do not see how the=\r\ny are not two distinct things.\nH.H. : Have it this way. Fate is past karma;=\r\n free-will is present karma. Both are really one, that is, karma, though th=\r\ney may differ in the matter of time. There can be no conflict when they are=\r\n really one.\n\nD. : But the difference in time is a vital difference which w=\r\ne cannot possibly overlook.\nH.H. : I do not want you to overlook it, but on=\r\nly to study it more deeply. The present is before you and, by the exercise =\r\nof free-will, you can attempt to shape it. The past is past and is therefor=\r\ne beyond your vision and is rightly called adrishta, the unseen. You cannot=\r\n reasonably attempt to find out the relative strength of two things unless =\r\nboth of them are before you. But, by our very definition, free-will, the pr=\r\nesent karma, alone is before you and fate, the past karma, is invisible. \n\n=\r\nEven if you see two wrestlers right in front of you, you cannot decide abou=\r\nt their relative strength. For, one may have weight, the other agility; one=\r\n muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit of\npractice and the other =\r\ncoolness of judgment and so on. We can go on building arguments on argument=\r\ns to conclude that a particular wrestler will be the winner.\n\nBut experienc=\r\ne shows that each of these qualifications may fail at any time or may prove=\r\n to be a disqualification. The only practical method of determining their r=\r\nelative strength will be to make them\nwrestle.\n\nWhile this is so, how do yo=\r\nu expect to find by means of arguments a solution to the problem of the rel=\r\native value of fate and free-will when the former by its very nature is uns=\r\neen!\n\nD. : Is there no way then of solving this problem?\nH.H. : There is th=\r\nis way. The wrestlers must fight with each other and prove which of them is=\r\n the stronger.\n\nD. : In other words, the problem of conflict will get solve=\r\nd only at the end of the conflict. But at that time the problem will have c=\r\neased to have any practical significance.\nH.H. : Not only so, it will cease=\r\n to exist.\nD. : That is, before the conflict begins, the problem is incapab=\r\nle of solution; and, after the conflict ends, it is no longer necessary to =\r\nfind a solution.\nH.H. : Just so. In either case, it is profitless to embark=\r\n on the enquiry as to the relative stregth of fate and free-will.\n\n=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nA Guide\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nD. : Does Yor Holiness =\r\nthen mean to say that we must resign ourselves to fate?\nH.H. : Certainly no=\r\nt. On the other hand, you must devote yourself to free-will.\n\nD. : How can =\r\nthat be?\nH.H. : Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exercise =\r\nof your free-will. By exercising your free-will in the past, you brought on=\r\n the resultant fate.\nBy exercising your free-will in the present, I want yo=\r\nu to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find=\r\n it enjoyable.\nI any case. whether for acquiring more happiness or for redu=\r\ncing misery. you have to exercise your free-will in the present.\n\nD. : But =\r\nthe exercise of free-will however well-directed, very often fails to secure=\r\n the desired result, as fate steps in and nullifies the action of free-will=\r\n.\nH.H. : You are again ignoring our definition of fate. It is not an extran=\r\neous and a new thing which steps in to nullify your free-will. On the other=\r\n hand, it is already in yourself.\n\nD. : It may be so, but its existence is =\r\nfelt only when it comes into conflict with free-will. How can we possibly w=\r\nipe out the past record when we do not know nor have the means of knowing w=\r\nhat it is?\nH.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced souls, the past cert=\r\nainly remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is very often an advant=\r\nage to us. For, if we happen to know all the results we have accumulated by=\r\n our actions in this and our past lives, we will be so much shocked as to g=\r\nive up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitigate them. Even in this li=\r\nfe, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful God has been pleased to besto=\r\nw on us, so that we may not be burdened at any moment with a recollection o=\r\nf all that has happened in the past.\n\nSimilarly, the divine spark in us is =\r\never bright with hope and makes it possible for us to confidently exercise =\r\nour free-will. It is not for us to belittle the significance of these two b=\r\noons--\nforgetfulness of the past and hope for the future.\n\nD. : Our ignoran=\r\nce of the past may be useful in not deterring the exercise of the free-will=\r\n, and hope may stimulate that exercise. All the same, it cannot be denied t=\r\nhat fate very often does present a formidable obstacle in the way of such e=\r\nxercise.\n\nH.H. : It is not quite correct to say that fate places obstacles =\r\nin the way of free-will. On the other hand, by seeming to oppose our effort=\r\ns, it tells us what is the extent of free-will that is necessary now to\nbea=\r\nr fruit.\n\nOrdinarily for the purpose of securing a single benefit, a partic=\r\nular activity is prescribed; but we do not know how intensively or how repe=\r\natedly that activity has to be pursued or pesisted in.\n\nIf we do not succed=\r\n at the very first attempt, we can easily deduce that in the past we have e=\r\nxercised our free-will just in the opposite direction, that the resultant o=\r\nf that past activity has first to be eliminated and that our present effort=\r\n must be proportionate to that past activity.\n\nThus, the obstacle which fat=\r\ne seems to offer is just the gauge by which we have to guide our present ac=\r\ntivities.\n\nH.H. : The obstacle is seen only after the exercise of our free-=\r\nwill; how can that help us to guide our activities at the start?\nH.H. : It =\r\nneed not guide us at the start. At the start, you must not be obsessed at a=\r\nll with the idea that there will be any obstacle in your way. Start with bo=\r\nundless hope and with the rpesumption that there is nothing in the way of y=\r\nour exercising the free-will.\n\nIf you do not succeed, tell yourself then th=\r\nat there has been in the past a counter-influence brought on by yourself by=\r\n exercising your free-will in the other direction and, therefore, you must =\r\nnow exercise your free-will with re-doubled vogor and persistence to achiev=\r\ne your object.\n\nTell yourself that, inasmuch as the seeming obstacle is of =\r\nyour own making, it is certainly within your competence to overcome it. If =\r\nyou do not succeed even after this renewed effort, there can be absolutely =\r\nno justification for despair, for fate being but a creature of your free-wi=\r\nll can never be stronger than your free-will.\n\nYour failure only means that=\r\n your present exercise of free-will is not sufficient to counteract the res=\r\nult of the past exercise of it.\n\nIn other words, there is no question of a =\r\nrelative proportion between fate and free-will as distinct factors in life.=\r\n The relative proportion is only as between the intensity of our past actio=\r\nn and\nthe intensity of our present action.\n\nD. : But even so, the relative =\r\nintensity can be realised only at the end of our present effort in a partic=\r\nular direction. \nH.H. : It is always so in the case of everything which is =\r\nadrishta or unseen. Take, for example, a nail driven into a wooden pillar. =\r\nWhen you see it for the first time, you actually see, say, an inch of it\npr=\r\nojecting out of the pillar. The rest of it has gone into the wood and you c=\r\nannot now see what exact length of the nail is imbedded in the wood. That l=\r\nength, therefore, is unseen or adrishta, so far as\nyou are concerned. Beaut=\r\nifully varnished as the pillar is, you do not know what is the composition =\r\nof the wood in which the nail is driven. That also is unseen or adrishta.\n\n=\r\nNow, suppose you want to pull that nail out, can you tell me how many pulls=\r\n will be necessary and how powerful each pull has to be?\n\nD. : How can I? T=\r\nhe number and the intensity of the pulls will depend upon the length which =\r\nhas gone into the wood.\n\nH.H. : Certainly so. And the length which has gone=\r\n into the wood is not arbitrary, but depended upon the number of strokes wh=\r\nich drove it in and the intensity of each of such strokes and the resistanc=\r\ne which the wood offered to them.\nD. : It is so.\nH.H. : The number and inte=\r\nnsity of the pulls needed to take out the nail depend therefore upon the nu=\r\nmber and intensity of the strokes which drove it in.\nD. : Yes.\nH.H. : But t=\r\nhe strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unseeable.\nThey relate=\r\n to the past and are adrishta.\nD. : Yes.\nH.H. : Do we stop from pulling out=\r\n the nail simply because we happen to be ignorant of the length of the nail=\r\n in the wood or of the number and intensity of the strokes which drove it i=\r\nn? Or, do we persist in\npulling it out by increasing our effort?\nD. : Certa=\r\ninly, as practical men we adopt the latter course.\nH.H. : Adopt the same co=\r\nurse in every effort of yours. Exert yourself as much as you can. Your will=\r\n must succeed in the end.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nFunction of Shastras:\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D \nD. : But there certainly are many things wh=\r\nich are impossible to attain even after the utmost exertion.\nH.H. : There y=\r\nou are mistaken. There is nothing which is really unattainable. A thing, ho=\r\nwever, may be unattainable to us at the particular stage at which we are, o=\r\nr with the qualifications that we\npossess. The attainability or otherwise o=\r\nf a particular thing is thus not an absolute characteristic of that thing b=\r\nut is relative and proportionate to our capacity to attain it.\n\nD. : The su=\r\nccess or failure of an effort can be known definitely only at the end. How =\r\nare we then to know beforehand whether with our present capacity we may or =\r\nmay not exert ourselves to attain a\nparticular object, and whether it is th=\r\ne right kind of exertion for the attainment of that object?\n\nH.H. : Your qu=\r\nestion is certainly a pertinent one. The whole aim of our Dharma Shastras i=\r\ns to give a detailed answer to your question. Religion does not fetter man&#39;=\r\ns free-will. It leaves him quite\nfree to act, but tells him at the same tim=\r\ne what is good for him and what is not.\nThe resposibility is entirely and s=\r\nolely his. He cannot escape it by blaming fate, for fate is of his own maki=\r\nng, nor by blaming God, for he is but the dispenser of fruits in accordance=\r\n with the merits of\nactions. You are the master of your own destiny. It is =\r\nfor you to make it, to better it or to mar it. This is your privilege. This=\r\n is your responsibility.\n\nD. : I quite realise this. But often it so happen=\r\ns that I am not really master of myself. I know, for instance, quite well t=\r\nhat a particular act is wrong; at the same time, I feel impelled to do it. =\r\nSimilarly,\nI know that another act is right; at the same time, however, I f=\r\neel powerless to do it. It seems that there is some power which is able to =\r\ncontrol or defy my free-will. So long as that power is potent, how can I be=\r\n called the master of my own destiny? What is that power but fate?\n\nH.H. : =\r\nYou are evidently confusing together two distinct things. Fate is a thing q=\r\nuite different from the other one which you call a power. Suppose you handl=\r\ne an instrument for the first time. You will do it\nvery clumsily and with g=\r\nreat effort. The next time, however, you use it, you will do so less clumsi=\r\nly and with less effort. With repeated uses, you will have learnt to use it=\r\n easily and without any effort. That is, the facility and ease with which y=\r\nou use a particular thing increase with the number of times you use it.\n\nTh=\r\ne first time a man steals, he does so with great effort and much fear; the =\r\nnext time both his effort and fear are much less. As opportunities increase=\r\n, stealing will become a normal habit with him and will require no effort a=\r\nt all. This habit will generate in him a tendency to steal even when there =\r\nis no  necessity to steal. It is this tendency which goes by the name vasan=\r\na. The power which makes you act as if against your will is only the vasana=\r\n which itself is of your own making. This is not fate.\n\nThe punishment or r=\r\neward, in the shape of pain or pleasure, which is the inevitable consequenc=\r\ne of an act, good or bad, is alone the province of fate or destiny.\n\nThe va=\r\nsana which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind in the shape of a =\r\ntaste, a greater facility or a greater tendency for doing the same act once=\r\n again, is quite a different thing. It may be that the punishment or the re=\r\nward of the past act is, in ordinary circumstances, unavoidable, if there i=\r\ns no counter-effort; but the vasana can be easily handled if only we exerci=\r\nse our free-will correctly.\n\nD. : But the number of vasanas or tendencies t=\r\nhat rule our hearts are endless. How can we possibly control them?\nH.H. : T=\r\nhe essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression in outward acts. This=\r\n characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and bad. The stream of vasan=\r\nas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two\ncurrents, the good and the b=\r\nad.\n\nIf you try to dam up the entire stream, there mey be danger. The Shast=\r\nras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On the other hand, they ask=\r\n you to submit yourself to be led by the good vasana current and to resist =\r\nbeing led away by the bad vasana current.\n\nWhen you know that a particular =\r\nvasana is rising up in your mind, you cannot possibly say that you are at i=\r\nts mercy. You have your wits about you and the responsibility of deciding w=\r\nhether you will encourage it or not is entirely yours. The Shastras ennciat=\r\ne in detail what vasanas are good and\nhave to be encouraged and what vasana=\r\ns are bad and have to beovercome.\n\nWhen, by dint of practice, you have made=\r\n all your vasanas good and practically eliminated the charge of any bad vas=\r\nanas leading you astray, the Shastras take upon themselves the function of =\r\nteaching you how to free your free-will even from the need of being led by =\r\ngood vasanas.\n\nYou will gradually be led on to a stage when your free-will =\r\nbe entirely free from any sort of coloring due to any vasanas. \n\nAt that st=\r\nage, your mind will be pure as crystal and all motive for particular action=\r\n will cease to be. Freedom from the results of particular actions is an ine=\r\nvitable consequence. Both fate and vasana disappear. There is freedom for e=\r\nver more and that freedom is called Moksha.\n_______________________________=\r\n___________________________\n\n.. shrii shaN^karaarpaNamastu ..\n\n\n\n \r\n--397762125-909199642-1324622394=:34101\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ta=\r\nhoma, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hi Priyank,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;This really is an interesting a=\r\nrticle.

I only stated the problem and did not even explain how =\r\nI find it to be a difficult one.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Your difficulty arises in the v=\r\nery statement of the problem. D. : How?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : A conflict arises only i=\r\nf there are two things. There can be no conflict if there is only one thing=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\nD. : But here there are two things, fate and free-will.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Ex=\r\nacly. It is this assumption of yours that is responsible for your problem.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nD. : It is not my assumption at all. How can I ignore the fact that the=\r\n two things exist as independent factors, whether I grant their existence o=\r\nr not?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : That is where you are wrong again.&lt;br&gt;\nD. : How?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nH.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you must know that fate is no=\r\nthing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum total of the results of your=\r\n past actions. As God is but the dispenser of the fruits of actions, fate, =\r\nrepresenting those fruits, is not his creation but only yours. Free-will is=\r\n what you exercise when you act now.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : Still I do not see how t=\r\nhey are not two distinct things.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Have it this way. Fate is past =\r\nkarma; free-will is present karma. Both are really one, that is, karma, tho=\r\nugh they may differ in the matter of time. There can be no conflict when th=\r\ney are really one.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : But the difference in time is a vital diff=\r\nerence which we cannot possibly overlook.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : I do not want you to o=\r\nverlook it, but only to study it more deeply. The present is before you and=\r\n, by the exercise of free-will, you can attempt to shape it. The past is pa=\r\nst and is therefore beyond your vision and is rightly called adrishta, the =\r\nunseen. You cannot reasonably attempt to find out the relative strength of =\r\ntwo things unless both of them are before you. But, by our very definition,=\r\n free-will, the present karma, alone is before you and fate, the past karma=\r\n, is invisible. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven if you see two wrestlers right in front of y=\r\nou, you cannot decide about their relative strength. For, one may have weig=\r\nht, the other agility; one muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit =\r\nof&lt;br&gt;\npractice and the other coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on =\r\nbuilding arguments on arguments to conclude that a particular wrestler will=\r\n be the winner.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBut experience shows that each of these qualificat=\r\nions may fail at any time or may prove to be a disqualification. The only p=\r\nractical method of determining their relative strength will be to make them=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nwrestle.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhile this is so, how do you expect to find by means=\r\n of arguments a solution to the problem of the relative value of fate and f=\r\nree-will when the former by its very nature is unseen!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : Is the=\r\nre no way then of solving this problem?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : There is this way. The w=\r\nrestlers must fight with each other and prove which of them is the stronger=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : In other words, the problem of conflict will get solved onl=\r\ny at the end of the conflict. But at that time the problem will have ceased=\r\n to have any practical significance.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Not only so, it will cease =\r\nto exist.&lt;br&gt;\nD. : That is, before the conflict begins, the problem is inca=\r\npable of solution; and, after the conflict ends, it is no longer necessary =\r\nto find a solution.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Just so. In either case, it is profitless to=\r\n embark on the enquiry as to the relative stregth of fate and free-will.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;br&gt;\nA Guide&lt;br&gt;\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nD. : Does Yor Holiness then mean to say that we must resign ourselves to =\r\nfate?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Certainly not. On the other hand, you must devote yourself=\r\n to free-will.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : How can that be?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Fate, as I told yo=\r\nu, is the resultant of the past exercise of your free-will. By exercising y=\r\nour free-will in the past, you brought on the resultant fate.&lt;br&gt;\nBy exerci=\r\nsing your free-will in the present, I want you to wipe out your past record=\r\n if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find it enjoyable.&lt;br&gt;\nI any case.=\r\n whether for acquiring more happiness or for reducing misery. you have to e=\r\nxercise your free-will in the present.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : But the exercise of fr=\r\nee-will however well-directed, very often fails to secure the desired resul=\r\nt, as fate steps in and nullifies the action of free-will.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : You a=\r\nre again ignoring our definition of fate. It is not an extraneous and a new=\r\n thing which steps in to nullify your free-will. On the other hand, it is a=\r\nlready in yourself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : It may be so, but its existence is felt o=\r\nnly when it comes into conflict with free-will. How can we possibly wipe ou=\r\nt the past record when we do not know nor have the means of knowing what it=\r\n is?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced souls, the past certai=\r\nnly remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is very often an advantag=\r\ne to us. For, if we happen to know all the results we have accumulated by o=\r\nur actions in this and our past lives, we will be so much shocked as to giv=\r\ne up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitigate them. Even in this life=\r\n, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful God has been pleased to bestow =\r\non us, so that we may not be burdened at any moment with a recollection of =\r\nall that has happened in the past.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, the divine spark in =\r\nus is ever bright with hope and makes it possible for us to confidently exe=\r\nrcise our free-will. It is not for us to belittle the significance of these=\r\n two boons--&lt;br&gt;\nforgetfulness of the past and hope for the future.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nD. : Our ignorance of the past may be useful in not deterring the exercis=\r\ne of the free-will, and hope may stimulate that exercise. All the same, it =\r\ncannot be denied that fate very often does present a formidable obstacle in=\r\n the way of such exercise.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : It is not quite correct to say t=\r\nhat fate places obstacles in the way of free-will. On the other hand, by se=\r\neming to oppose our efforts, it tells us what is the extent of free-will th=\r\nat is necessary now to&lt;br&gt;\nbear fruit.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOrdinarily for the purpose =\r\nof securing a single benefit, a particular activity is prescribed; but we d=\r\no not know how intensively or how repeatedly that activity has to be pursue=\r\nd or pesisted in.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf we do not succed at the very first attempt, w=\r\ne can easily deduce that in the past we have exercised our free-will just i=\r\nn the opposite direction, that the resultant of that past activity has firs=\r\nt to be eliminated and that our present effort must be proportionate to tha=\r\nt past activity.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThus, the obstacle which fate seems to offer is j=\r\nust the gauge by which we have to guide our present activities.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nH.=\r\nH. : The obstacle is seen only after the exercise of our free-will; how can=\r\n that help us to guide our activities at the start?&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : It need not =\r\nguide us at the start. At the start, you must not be obsessed at all with t=\r\nhe idea that there will be any obstacle in your way. Start with boundless h=\r\nope and with the rpesumption that there is nothing in the way of your exerc=\r\nising the free-will.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you do not succeed, tell yourself then tha=\r\nt there has been in the past a counter-influence brought on by yourself by =\r\nexercising your free-will in the other direction and, therefore, you must n=\r\now exercise your free-will with re-doubled vogor and persistence to achieve=\r\n your object.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTell yourself that, inasmuch as the seeming obstacle=\r\n is of your own making, it is certainly within your competence to overcome =\r\nit. If you do not succeed even after this renewed effort, there can be abso=\r\nlutely no justification for despair, for fate being but a creature of your =\r\nfree-will can never be stronger than your free-will.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYour failure =\r\nonly means that your present exercise of free-will is not sufficient to cou=\r\nnteract the result of the past exercise of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn other words, the=\r\nre is no question of a relative proportion between fate and free-will as di=\r\nstinct factors in life. The relative proportion is only as between the inte=\r\nnsity of our past action and&lt;br&gt;\nthe intensity of our present action.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nD. : But even so, the relative intensity can be realised only at the en=\r\nd of our present effort in a particular direction. &lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : It is always=\r\n so in the case of everything which is adrishta or unseen. Take, for exampl=\r\ne, a nail driven into a wooden pillar. When you see it for the first time, =\r\nyou actually see, say, an inch of it&lt;br&gt;\nprojecting out of the pillar. The =\r\nrest of it has gone into the wood and you cannot now see what exact length =\r\nof the nail is imbedded in the wood. That length, therefore, is unseen or a=\r\ndrishta, so far as&lt;br&gt;\nyou are concerned. Beautifully varnished as the pill=\r\nar is, you do not know what is the composition of the wood in which the nai=\r\nl is driven. That also is unseen or adrishta.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow, suppose you wan=\r\nt to pull that nail out, can you tell me how many pulls will be necessary a=\r\nnd how powerful each pull has to be?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : How can I? The number an=\r\nd the intensity of the pulls will depend upon the length which has gone int=\r\no the wood.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Certainly so. And the length which has gone int=\r\no the wood is not arbitrary, but depended upon the number of strokes which =\r\ndrove it in and the intensity of each of such strokes and the resistance wh=\r\nich the wood offered to them.&lt;br&gt;\nD. : It is so.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : The number and =\r\nintensity of the pulls needed to take out the nail depend therefore upon th=\r\ne number and intensity of the strokes which drove it in.&lt;br&gt;\nD. : Yes.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nH.H. : But the strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unseeable.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThey relate to the past and are adrishta.&lt;br&gt;\nD. : Yes.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Do =\r\nwe stop from pulling out the nail simply because we happen to be ignorant o=\r\nf the length of the nail in the wood or of the number and intensity of the =\r\nstrokes which drove it in? Or, do we persist in&lt;br&gt;\npulling it out by incre=\r\nasing our effort?&lt;br&gt;\nD. : Certainly, as practical men we adopt the latter =\r\ncourse.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : Adopt the same course in every effort of yours. Exert yo=\r\nurself as much as you can. Your will must succeed in the end.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;br&gt;\nFunctio=\r\nn of Shastras:&lt;br&gt;\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D &lt;br&gt;\nD. : But there certainly are many things which are impossibl=\r\ne to attain even after the utmost exertion.&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : There you are mistak=\r\nen. There is nothing which is really unattainable. A thing, however, may be=\r\n unattainable to us at the particular stage at which we are, or with the qu=\r\nalifications that we&lt;br&gt;\npossess. The attainability or otherwise of a parti=\r\ncular thing is thus not an absolute characteristic of that thing but is rel=\r\native and proportionate to our capacity to attain it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : The suc=\r\ncess or failure of an effort can be known definitely only at the end. How a=\r\nre we then to know beforehand whether with our present capacity we may or m=\r\nay not exert ourselves to attain a&lt;br&gt;\nparticular object, and whether it is=\r\n the right kind of exertion for the attainment of that object?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nH.H=\r\n. : Your question is certainly a pertinent one. The whole aim of our Dharma=\r\n Shastras is to give a detailed answer to your question. Religion does not =\r\nfetter man&#39;s free-will. It leaves him quite&lt;br&gt;\nfree to act, but tells him =\r\nat the same time what is good for him and what is not.&lt;br&gt;\nThe resposibilit=\r\ny is entirely and solely his. He cannot escape it by blaming fate, for fate=\r\n is of his own making, nor by blaming God, for he is but the dispenser of f=\r\nruits in accordance with the merits of&lt;br&gt;\nactions. You are the master of y=\r\nour own destiny. It is for you to make it, to better it or to mar it. This =\r\nis your privilege. This is your responsibility.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : I quite reali=\r\nse this. But often it so happens that I am not really master of myself. I k=\r\nnow, for instance, quite well that a particular act is wrong; at the same t=\r\nime, I feel impelled to do it. Similarly,&lt;br&gt;\nI know that another act is ri=\r\nght; at the same time, however, I feel powerless to do it. It seems that th=\r\nere is some power which is able to control or defy my free-will. So long as=\r\n that power is potent, how can I be called the master of my own destiny? Wh=\r\nat is that power but fate?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nH.H. : You are evidently confusing toge=\r\nther two distinct things. Fate is a thing quite different from the other on=\r\ne which you call a power. Suppose you handle an instrument for the first ti=\r\nme. You will do it&lt;br&gt;\nvery clumsily and with great effort. The next time, =\r\nhowever, you use it, you will do so less clumsily and with less effort. Wit=\r\nh repeated uses, you will have learnt to use it easily and without any effo=\r\nrt. That is, the facility and ease with which you use a particular thing in=\r\ncrease with the number of times you use it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe first time a man s=\r\nteals, he does so with great effort and much fear; the next time both his e=\r\nffort and fear are much less. As opportunities increase, stealing will beco=\r\nme a normal habit with him and will require no effort at all. This habit wi=\r\nll generate in him a tendency to steal even when there is no  necessity to =\r\nsteal. It is this tendency which goes by the name vasana. The power which m=\r\nakes you act as if against your will is only the vasana which itself is of =\r\nyour own making. This is not fate.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe punishment or reward, in th=\r\ne shape of pain or pleasure, which is the inevitable consequence of an act,=\r\n good or bad, is alone the province of fate or destiny.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe vasana=\r\n which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind in the shape of a tast=\r\ne, a greater facility or a greater tendency for doing the same act once aga=\r\nin, is quite a different thing. It may be that the punishment or the reward=\r\n of the past act is, in ordinary circumstances, unavoidable, if there is no=\r\n counter-effort; but the vasana can be easily handled if only we exercise o=\r\nur free-will correctly.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nD. : But the number of vasanas or tendenci=\r\nes that rule our hearts are endless. How can we possibly control them?&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nH.H. : The essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression in outward ac=\r\nts. This characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and bad. The stream =\r\nof vasanas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two&lt;br&gt;\ncurrents, the go=\r\nod and the bad.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you try to dam up the entire stream, there mey =\r\nbe danger. The Shastras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On the =\r\nother hand, they ask you to submit yourself to be led by the good vasana cu=\r\nrrent and to resist being led away by the bad vasana current.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen=\r\n you know that a particular vasana is rising up in your mind, you cannot po=\r\nssibly say that you are at its mercy. You have your wits about you and the =\r\nresponsibility of deciding whether you will encourage it or not is entirely=\r\n yours. The Shastras ennciate in detail what vasanas are good and&lt;br&gt;\nhave =\r\nto be encouraged and what vasanas are bad and have to beovercome.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nWhen, by dint of practice, you have made all your vasanas good and practica=\r\nlly eliminated the charge of any bad vasanas leading you astray, the Shastr=\r\nas take upon themselves the function of teaching you how to free your free-=\r\nwill even from the need of being led by good vasanas.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou will gra=\r\ndually be led on to a stage when your free-will be entirely free from any s=\r\nort of coloring due to any vasanas. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt that stage, your mind will=\r\n be pure as crystal and all motive for particular action will cease to be. =\r\nFreedom from the results of particular actions is an inevitable consequence=\r\n. Both fate and vasana disappear. There is freedom for ever more and that f=\r\nreedom is called Moksha.&lt;br&gt;\n______________________________________________=\r\n____________&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n.. shrii shaN^karaarpaNamastu ..&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b=\r\nody&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--397762125-909199642-1324622394=:34101--\r\n\n"}}
