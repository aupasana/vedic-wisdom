Whether the prie=\r\nst has accumulated spiritual sakthi or not, if he is sincere and has the co=\r\nrrect attitude it may be worthwhile.\n\n\n\nWhen I do my homam, some times, my =\r\nson joins and does abhishekam to Shiv linga. One day, we went to attend hou=\r\nse warming function of my sister and I carried my basic stuff for my homam =\r\nbut did not carry Shiv ling. My son felt like joining and he asked if I hav=\r\ne the Shiv ling. He was not happy when I answered in negative and kept argu=\r\neing that I should have brought it too. I told him, God is every where and =\r\nhe can even treat a stone as Shiv ling. I told him, if you are sincere and =\r\npure at hearth and assume Shiv is infront of you, Shiv will accept your off=\r\nering.l Well, I know this is true. Is there any place where Shiv is not the=\r\nre? Whether or not, I invoked him or not, Shiv or any God for that matter i=\r\ns just by our side. My son, went out, found a round shaped stone and did mR=\r\ntyunjaya mantra japa along with abhishekam. As far he is concerned, he beli=\r\neved me and there are no questions in his mind. When such believe is bestor=\r\ned in your priest, YOU CAN BECOME\n PURE momentarily and what ever you offer=\r\n in full trust that god is accepting it, is accepted by God. There is no do=\r\nubt in it.\n\n\n\nAs per the impact it create, what impact you want? If you wan=\r\nted an impact, they you attempted business with God. When you do not want a=\r\nny thing in return, then you are already getting the impact. Otherwise, how=\r\n, living in this material world, you did not expect any thing for what you =\r\ndo?\n\n\n\nThe result, you will get is to improve your attitude. That WILL happ=\r\nen if you offered sincerely.\n\n\n\nThe mythology is full of stories that sugge=\r\nst, in complete surrender or otherwise, if the call to God is sincere, God =\r\nwill always answer the same. It is another thing if we realized that God ha=\r\ns already answered us!\n\n\n\nThe very fact, that we are finding time to read/w=\r\nrite message like this shows that we are trying to correct our attitude and=\r\n seek god. This itself is the result of what ever little sadhana we are doi=\r\nng.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nVijay\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_=\r\npathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Namaste Satish Ji,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; First of =\r\nall i must say that I was happy & impressed to see your message and the hon=\r\nesty with which you went about writing such detailed critique.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 1) Na=\r\nrasimha Garu says that &quot;Accumulated Shakti&quot; is the primary pre-requisite to=\r\n bring about the specific result of any specific ritual.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; you are of =\r\nthe opinion that It is not so and he is a mere Technician who is expert of =\r\nperforming ritual as prescribed and result is entirely because of the invok=\r\ned deity.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Both the views are correct to me only the subtle understan=\r\nding is needed. I am of the opinion that if the priest does not posses at l=\r\neast a little spiritual power, He can not invoke deity&#39;s presence however e=\r\nxpert and perfectionist he is in performing a ritual.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Yes, i agree w=\r\nith you that &quot;Results&quot; are given because Deity is pleased by the ritual and=\r\n offerings BUT can a divine deity will even be present if invoked by a pers=\r\non who is not capable?. Pleasing of deity is even far away.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It is we=\r\nll known that Brahamana&#39;s of yore were following very stringent, discipline=\r\nd, Unselfish and God-oriented life. They everyday used to devote good amoun=\r\nt of time in their personal sadhanas. (I am talking about Majority of them.=\r\n every Yuga has every yuga present as you correctly said). I think, because=\r\n of that highly evolved life style and off course equipped with expertise o=\r\nf performing various rituals, they were fit to become mediators between Yaj=\r\namana and Devata. A real brahmana would therefore capable of invoking Devin=\r\ne preence to the best of his ability and get the results for the Yajamana.\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So here i am sure you&#39;ll see point of &quot;caliber&quot; factor for person pe=\r\nrforming the ritual for &quot;Materialistic Desires&quot; of 3rd party (i.e. Yajamana=\r\n).\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 2) You have mis-understood &quot;Bagging bawl&quot; &quot;Beggars&quot; etc... With t=\r\nhe term beggars, He basically means most of us who are &quot;Helpless & hopeless=\r\nly Trapped&quot; &quot;Aspirants&quot; who cry to mother for the release. It is not to be =\r\nmeant as a degrading term for the &quot;Imperishable Self&quot;.\n\n&gt; &quot;Tamupeihi Mahaar=\r\naja Sharanam Tvam Parameshwari&quot;\n\n&gt; &quot;Aaaraadhitaa Saivanrunaam bhog swargaap=\r\navargadaa&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Request you to understand Narasimha a little deeper. Plea=\r\nse do not take words literally. And in reality, to be blunt, most of us are=\r\n &quot;Beggars&quot;. We pray (beg) for good life, good Job, good Money, good House, =\r\nbest of this and best of that and best of all that. we seldomly say to god =\r\n&quot;without&quot; folded hands that God tussi great Ho. Mujhe kuch nahi chahiye....=\r\ntujhe kuch chahiye to bol...chal tujhe main mera pyaar deta hu tu bhi kyaa =\r\nyaad karega ki kis rais se paalaa pada tha&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 3) I am very happy that =\r\nyou gave indirect answer to my earlier question to a different Gentleman, w=\r\nhen you said this about Homa:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; [Yes, as this concept is blessed by di=\r\nvine mother homa is going to be popular sadhana in coming years.]\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Ye=\r\ns Narasimha is in Hurry. He has a finite life and there is a lot to start j=\r\nust like Vivekananda was in a hurry! But rest assured that hurry is also du=\r\ne to wish of Chandi and Narasimha, in my opinion, has become one of the bes=\r\nt instruments of Jagadamba!!!\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; But Again, i really appreciated your p=\r\nointing apprehensions. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Warm Regards,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Utpal\n\n&gt; Namaschand=\r\nikayei!\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Satish Deshpand=\r\ne &lt;satishdesh@&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji and all respec=\r\nted members          - Namaste\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Astrologe=\r\nrs routinely recommend remedial measures involving mantras and\n\n&gt; &gt; poojas =\r\nand people spend a lot of money on them.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Do they work? I will gi=\r\nve my 2 cents of views based on my experience and\n\n&gt; &gt; insights. I will be =\r\nhonest, straight-forward and blunt.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Like\n\n&gt; &gt; me and all others who respect Shri PVR Narsimhaji as a no=\r\nble, honest,\n\n&gt; &gt; intelligent, spiritual person and Sanskrit scholar must b=\r\ne feeling sad after\n\n&gt; &gt; reading contents in the post heading efficacy of a=\r\nstro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really\n\n&gt; &gt; painful to read such thing from a p=\r\nerson of his status whom lot of people\n\n&gt; &gt; considered as a good astro-spir=\r\nitual personality. Though I am not having\n\n&gt; &gt; scripture references i=E2=80=\r\n=99ll try to post my humble protest and request to all\n\n&gt; &gt; members to unde=\r\nrstand and study shastra deeply for better understanding. \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Thoug=\r\nh believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their\n\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nroblems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing any\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a=\r\n pudding\n\n&gt; &gt; exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout li=\r\nfe. And some\n\n&gt; &gt; intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedi=\r\nes. Let me first address\n\n&gt; &gt; why this has come to be and then talk about w=\r\nhat we should do. \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Results\n\n&gt; &gt; are produced rather bestowed upo=\r\nn the yajamana by presiding devata or deity and\n\n&gt; &gt; blessings are called =\r\n=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [\n\n&gt; &gt; krupA] Here we think results ar=\r\ne produced; so let us understand the method. If\n\n&gt; &gt; somebody wants good ma=\r\ntch for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to\n\n&gt; &gt; perform remedy a=\r\nnd in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the\n\n&gt; &gt; focal point=\r\n is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=99s\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire and=\r\n in return get\n\n&gt; &gt; paid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediat=\r\nor or a technician who\n\n&gt; &gt; can interact with both parties. And interaction=\r\n means correct rituals with\n\n&gt; &gt; appropriate mantras. So his spiritual or m=\r\nental strength is not required but\n\n&gt; &gt; his skill and knowledge is of prime=\r\n importance. Can we consider a mortal priest\n\n&gt; &gt; to bless a yajamana? And =\r\nif a priest can bless yajamana what is the role of\n\n&gt; &gt; rituals, mantras? T=\r\nhe truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the human beings by\n\n&gt; &gt; devatas a=\r\ns only divinity is capable of this. And many times fruits are not\n\n&gt; &gt; rece=\r\nived due to karmic blockages of yajamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87\n\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=\r\n=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [ in kaliyuga four\n\n&gt; &gt; times ef=\r\nforts are needed] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for doing\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy\n\n&gt; &gt; task on the pa=\r\nrt of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of\n\n&gt; &gt; yajamana.\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given=\r\n by one\n\n&gt; &gt; for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is e=\r\nmpty, what good\n\n&gt; &gt; is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounc=\r\ne. Similarly, poojas done\n\n&gt; &gt; and blessings given by a priest without enou=\r\ngh spiritual energy cannot bring\n\n&gt; &gt; one any benefits.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Yajamana get fruits of the rituals from the inbuilt bank balance =\r\nof deities\n\n&gt; &gt; and not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine energy, called =\r\ndevata can give\n\n&gt; &gt; million dollar check to unlimited no of people as GOD =\r\nhas sanctioned rather\n\n&gt; &gt; appointed them for this work. In Rugveda traditi=\r\non in vedic rituals in any\n\n&gt; &gt; pooja with or without homa in the beginning=\r\n there is one ritual called\n\n&gt; &gt; aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=\r\n=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means yajamana n=\r\nominate a\n\n&gt; &gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf and in=\r\n the end before\n\n&gt; &gt; visarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is perfo=\r\nrmed\n\n&gt; &gt; in which priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual =\r\nto yajamana.\n\n&gt; &gt; Here we can clearly understand the role of priest and the=\r\n role of deity. As per\n\n&gt; &gt; karmic law if you bless some body you lose your=\r\n punya and blessed one get that\n\n&gt; &gt; share of punya reducing your strength =\r\non all levels. Can a mortal though highly\n\n&gt; &gt; qualified priest blessed man=\r\ny yajamanas as he interacts with many in his lifetime?\n\n&gt; &gt; This could be p=\r\nossible only for highly evolved soul like saints and yogis as\n\n&gt; &gt; due to g=\r\nreat penance they do have such powers. But even for them also some time\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; loss of spiritual energy leads for further penance. We read lot of storie=\r\ns in\n\n&gt; &gt; ancient mythology of sages enticed by apsarAs [superhuman beautif=\r\nul lady] or if\n\n&gt; &gt; they cursed some body results in renewed penances to re=\r\ngain there status.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; One important note: The pow=\r\ner is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)\n\n&gt; &gt; or a sequence of phys=\r\nical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that\n\n&gt; &gt; FOCUSES on a comb=\r\nination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical\n\n&gt; &gt; actions (ritua=\r\nl). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to\n\n&gt; &gt; wander and=\r\n instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Wi=\r\nthout\n\n&gt; &gt; it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lo=\r\nt of practice.\n\n&gt; &gt; Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when =\r\nthey go and do poojas.\n\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana an=\r\nd brought that energy to the\n\n&gt; &gt; table when they did rituals at the houses=\r\n of people or in temples.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=\r\n=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 [ science of pathway to GOD] and=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; [science of full feeling desires through devata] i.e. =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 =C2=A0are two different things. This science of\n\n&gt; &gt; man=\r\ntra and devata is not easy to understand. Divinity is beyond logic and huma=\r\nn\n\n&gt; &gt; mind is not capable to experience it easily.

The subtle seat of paravak is at naval and creator\n\n&gt; &gt; brahma creates th=\r\nis world with the help of saraswati and sarsawati is nothing\n\n&gt; &gt; but 52 sy=\r\nllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=\r\n=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of syllables. When two unknown person meets=\r\n first\n\n&gt; &gt; time how they get connected? Through communication and thought =\r\nis a form of\n\n&gt; &gt; vak, pashyanti. First there is desire to know each other =\r\nand then communication\n\n&gt; &gt; starts. And in communication if some body expre=\r\nss negativity communication\n\n&gt; &gt; stops. So for communication soft speech, g=\r\nood words, etc are imp. So how can we\n\n&gt; &gt; assume that mantra or rituals ar=\r\ne of no importance? These show qualities, tools\n\n&gt; &gt; necessary to get conne=\r\ncted with devatas in right perspective. In scriptures\n\n&gt; &gt; every syllable i=\r\ns assigned colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of that\n\n&gt; &gt; syllabl=\r\ne resulting in typical energy. To be precise power rest with desire and\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; mind is a mere tool to channalise that power and strength of desire will =\r\ndecide\n\n&gt; &gt; depth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana, mind is of p=\r\nriest and\n\n&gt; &gt; blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro treat=\r\ny like BPHS, sage\n\n&gt; &gt; parAsharA recommended various rituals of various dev=\r\natas for removing bad\n\n&gt; &gt; effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placement=\r\ns. I wonder if mantra and\n\n&gt; &gt; rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is havin=\r\ng so many homa manuals. \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; To consider spiritual aspect of it, per=\r\nsons like saint or yogis who do have\n\n&gt; &gt; dharanA like a solid rock who alw=\r\nays rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not\n\n&gt; &gt; require mantra or tantra, r=\r\nituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can\n\n&gt; &gt; do work. Normal pe=\r\nople like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of\n\n&gt; &gt; patanjal=\r\ni like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, ta=\r\nntra,\n\n&gt; &gt; nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many many=\r\n things count. =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0This whole confusi=\r\non is due to\n\n&gt; &gt; Narsimhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality =\r\nand he is doing this with pure\n\n&gt; &gt; heart. Yes, focus mind is one of the fa=\r\nctors in this whole exercise. Many have\n\n&gt; &gt; seen shatachandI or mahArudra =\r\nanushathAna where many priest at a time read or\n\n&gt; &gt; chant mantras with dif=\r\nferent level of mind focus still yajamana get fruits of\n\n&gt; &gt; it in terms of=\r\n desires. This is because devata is pleased by offerings, japa\n\n&gt; &gt; and hOm=\r\ne which in turn bless the yajamana with HIS blessings.=C2=A0 For spirituali=\r\nty focus, pure heart and\n\n&gt; &gt; continuous efforts are of prime importance bu=\r\nt for getting our desires to be\n\n&gt; &gt; fulfilled we need correct procedure, a=\r\nppropriate deity and correct mantra.\n\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=\r\n=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 is a love relationship BTW jiva =\r\nand parmAtmA =E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 =E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=\r\n=BE =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=\r\n=AE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE; where as =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=\r\n=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=B0 or mantrashAshtra is a give and take relationship =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=\r\n=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=A8\n\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=9E=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A4.

The proce=\r\ndures have evolved to become quite\n\n&gt; &gt; complicated over the time too! Howe=\r\nver, complexity of rituals should never be a\n\n&gt; &gt; deterrent. Suppose rules =\r\ndictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams\n\n&gt; &gt; of protein,=\r\n so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such\n\n&gt; &gt; ba=\r\nlanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or wil=\r\nl\n\n&gt; &gt; you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (l=\r\nentil soup)\n\n&gt; &gt; and rice,\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; you will simply eat it. You atleast g=\r\net some energy. Similarly, if you do\n\n&gt; &gt; not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do =\r\na mantra/ritual, you need not wait\n\n&gt; &gt; till you know the perfect way. You =\r\ncan start with what you know. It will only\n\n&gt; &gt; give you energy.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the\n\n&gt; &gt; not=\r\nion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; baseless, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to focus the mind=\r\n on some\n\n&gt; &gt; mantras and rituals and get specific results. When used by so=\r\nmeone with a high\n\n&gt; &gt; level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals =\r\nmay work very fast and give\n\n&gt; &gt; specific powerful results. However, Nature=\r\n has purposely hidden (almost) such\n\n&gt; &gt; things in this age.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and should be done by=\r\n experts only\n\n&gt; &gt; as these are for special purposes and should be done by =\r\ntrained people. There\n\n&gt; &gt; are hundreds of ways for GOD realization and a s=\r\ningle way to fulfill our\n\n&gt; &gt; desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know how to dri=\r\nve a car why opt for a fighter plane? =C2=A0=C2=A0Only if you elders, gurus=\r\n have sanctioned it\n\n&gt; &gt; then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden anyth=\r\ning but due to loss of energy\n\n&gt; &gt; in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. =\r\nfor removing karmic blocks we feel we\n\n&gt; &gt; need more energy and we are not =\r\ngetting it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect\n\n&gt; &gt; thing as perfection is=\r\n subjective matter but we must read study, think, analyze\n\n&gt; &gt; before accep=\r\nting any concept. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as\n\n&gt; &gt; this i=\r\ns one of the best ways for acceleration according to my experiences in my\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; twenties but it is for spirituality and for desires to get full filled =\r\nthrough\n\n&gt; &gt; deities every thing counts.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of diff=\r\nerent shapes.\n\n&gt; &gt; They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a be=\r\ngging bowl you use, you\n\n&gt; &gt; may be given different kind of alms. But it is=\r\n important to start begging with\n\n&gt; &gt; some begging bowl or the other, inste=\r\nad of spending years looking for the\n\n&gt; &gt; perfect begging bowl. Instead of =\r\nwaiting for astrologers with half-baked or\n\n&gt; &gt; ill-conceived knowledge to =\r\ntell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your\n\n&gt; &gt; heart tells you or=\r\n what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; &gt; WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but anshA of GOD. =E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=\r\n=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Human being is the best creativity\n\n&gt; &gt; of HIM, the di=\r\nvine. The sole aim of manushyayOnI is to realize HIM. In this\n\n&gt; &gt; journey =\r\nwe may face many types of different obstacles due to our karma and to\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsurpass them HE has given us power and rights to use our intellect, mind fo=\r\nr\n\n&gt; &gt; healthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And whole karma done for this in=\r\n a pious\n\n&gt; &gt; manner is a sattvic karma. Even for getting fulfilled our des=\r\nires we do have a\n\n&gt; &gt; relationship of respect, love, gratitude with devata=\r\ns. Beggars don=E2=80=99t have any\n\n&gt; &gt; feelings for donors instead they eve=\r\nn don=E2=80=99t remember them.

And for everybody,\n\n&gt; &gt; karma counts re=\r\nsulting in happenings of life.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Mantras l=\r\nike Gayatri mantra, Shiva\n\n&gt; &gt; panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama sto=\r\ntra, Ganapathi atharva seersha,\n\n&gt; &gt; Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman st=\r\notra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari\n\n&gt; &gt; mantra, Venkatesw=\r\nara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra,\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Cha=\r\nndipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama\n\n&gt; &gt; sto=\r\ntra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam,\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi ashtotta=\r\nrashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for\n\n&gt; &gt; anyone for any =\r\npurpose.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; There\n\n&gt; &gt; are many generic mantras (see my original ma=\r\nil at the bottom for a sample list)\n\n&gt; &gt; that are appliable to everybody an=\r\nd can\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; solve\n\n&gt; &gt; ALL problems. For example, Vishnu sahasranaama =\r\nstotra explicitly says it can\n\n&gt; &gt; solve ANY problem. Instead of looking fo=\r\nr a\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;perfect\n\n&gt; &gt; mantra recommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic=\r\n mantra like that and start\n\n&gt; &gt; sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; If\n\n&gt; &gt; your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amou=\r\nnt energy may be enough\n\n&gt; &gt; to move it away. If it is the size of a big\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; boulder\n\n&gt; &gt; on the other hand, much more energy may be needed.\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; It\n\n&gt; &gt; seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to =\r\nspread concept of homa in this world.\n\n&gt; &gt; Yes, as this concept is blessed =\r\nby divine mother homa is going to be popular\n\n&gt; &gt; sadhana in coming years. =\r\nIn his anxiety to spread this blessing he is\n\n&gt; &gt; contradicting his own wor=\r\nds. Mantras do have vargabheda and can be broadly\n\n&gt; &gt; categorized as=C2=A0=\r\n shrutimantra,\n\n&gt; &gt; smritimantra, puranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex. We=\r\n can broadly classify savitur\n\n&gt; &gt; gayatri as shrutimantra; chandipatha as =\r\nsmrutinmantra; vishnusahastranam as\n\n&gt; &gt; puranmantra and shabarimantra[crea=\r\nted by great navanath yogis] as varadamantra.\n\n&gt; &gt; The term generic is itse=\r\nlf illusive. Every devata, every mantra is assigned\n\n&gt; &gt; different power, d=\r\nifferent work by cosmic mother.

Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by\n\n&gt; &gt; remov=\r\ning karmic blocks we can get this, by doing various correct procedures we\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; can achieve this and this happens due to generated punya in this whole\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; exercise. For full filling desires we should know the depth of karma, =\r\nto remove\n\n&gt; &gt; karmic blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we=\r\n must have exact\n\n&gt; &gt; tools in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and=\r\n at last generation of\n\n&gt; &gt; punya in real timeframe. \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Let us hav=\r\ne a quick look at Narsimhji=E2=80=99s post on\n\n&gt; &gt; remedy for begetting a c=\r\nhild. He has suggested main remedy as santangopal\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; mantra a well =\r\nknown proven remedy. Why he suggested\n\n&gt; &gt; that? If every mantra from his g=\r\neneric list can do this he should have suggested\n\n&gt; &gt; any one. As per the s=\r\nhashtra the analogy should be like this. Here we will\n\n&gt; &gt; sidetrack depth =\r\nof karma as this is near impossible to understand =E0=A4=97=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=\r\n=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=\r\n=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a\n\n&gt; &gt; childless couple=\r\n aged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately need\n\n&gt; &gt; a baby.=\r\n Snatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity responsible for\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; sustenance of universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the mantra itsel=\r\nf is\n\n&gt; &gt; self explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the most imp=\r\n it will\n\n&gt; &gt; generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called ge=\r\nneric mantra is\n\n&gt; &gt; capable of giving everything to everybody but the main=\r\n hurdle is timeframe. If\n\n&gt; &gt; we do any sadhana for long time we accumulate=\r\n punya; energy to have all\n\n&gt; &gt; pleasures in the world whereas the use of t=\r\nhis punya depends upon the\n\n&gt; &gt; individual. In this case punya required to =\r\nbeget a child is missing so we need\n\n&gt; &gt; that energy in real time frame as =\r\nafter 45/50 it is unlikely that lady will be\n\n&gt; &gt; capable of begetting a ch=\r\nild. Yes, all generic mantra will give child but in\n\n&gt; &gt; next birth as spec=\r\nific form of punya required to beget a baby will be\n\n&gt; &gt; accumulated after =\r\ndoing generic mantra for long time rather whole life time. As\n\n&gt; &gt; said in =\r\nvishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next birth including\n\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\naby and major part of that punya will be consumed for said cause of baby\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; leaving small part for other pleasures.

Whether the priest has accumulated spiritual sakthi or not, if he is =\r\nsincere and has the correct attitude it may be worthwhile.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen I =\r\ndo my homam, some times, my son joins and does abhishekam to Shiv linga. On=\r\ne day, we went to attend house warming function of my sister and I carried =\r\nmy basic stuff for my homam but did not carry Shiv ling. My son felt like j=\r\noining and he asked if I have the Shiv ling. He was not happy when I answer=\r\ned in negative and kept argueing that I should have brought it too. I told =\r\nhim, God is every where and he can even treat a stone as Shiv ling. I told =\r\nhim, if you are sincere and pure at hearth and assume Shiv is infront of yo=\r\nu, Shiv will accept your offering.l Well, I know this is true. Is there any=\r\n place where Shiv is not there? Whether or not, I invoked him or not, Shiv =\r\nor any God for that matter is just by our side. My son, went out, found a r=\r\nound shaped stone and did mRtyunjaya mantra japa along with abhishekam. As =\r\nfar he is concerned, he believed me and there are no questions in his mind.=\r\n When such believe is bestored in your priest, YOU CAN BECOME\n PURE momenta=\r\nrily and what ever you offer in full trust that god is accepting it, is acc=\r\nepted by God. There is no doubt in it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs per the impact it create=\r\n, what impact you want? If you wanted an impact, they you attempted busines=\r\ns with God. When you do not want any thing in return, then you are already =\r\ngetting the impact. Otherwise, how, living in this material world, you did =\r\nnot expect any thing for what you do?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe result, you will get is =\r\nto improve your attitude. That WILL happen if you offered sincerely.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nThe mythology is full of stories that suggest, in complete surrender or =\r\notherwise, if the call to God is sincere, God will always answer the same. =\r\nIt is another thing if we realized that God has already answered us!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nThe very fact, that we are finding time to read/write message like this =\r\nshows that we are trying to correct our attitude and seek god.

I am of the opinion that if the priest does not posses at least a little =\r\nspiritual power, He can not invoke deity&#39;s presence however expert and perf=\r\nectionist he is in performing a ritual.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yes, i agree wit=\r\nh you that &quot;Results&quot; are given because Deity is pleased by the ritual and o=\r\nfferings BUT can a divine deity will even be present if invoked by a person=\r\n who is not capable?. Pleasing of deity is even far away.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; It is well known that Brahamana&#39;s of yore were following very stringent, =\r\ndisciplined, Unselfish and God-oriented life. They everyday used to devote =\r\ngood amount of time in their personal sadhanas. (I am talking about Majorit=\r\ny of them. every Yuga has every yuga present as you correctly said). I thin=\r\nk, because of that highly evolved life style and off course equipped with e=\r\nxpertise of performing various rituals, they were fit to become mediators b=\r\netween Yajamana and Devata. A real brahmana would therefore capable of invo=\r\nking Devine preence to the best of his ability and get the results for the =\r\nYajamana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So here i am sure you&#39;ll see point of &quot;caliber=\r\n&quot; factor for person performing the ritual for &quot;Materialistic Desires&quot; of 3r=\r\nd party (i.e. Yajamana).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2) You have mis-understood &quot;Bag=\r\nging bawl&quot; &quot;Beggars&quot; etc... With the term beggars, He basically means most =\r\nof us who are &quot;Helpless &amp; hopelessly Trapped&quot; &quot;Aspirants&quot; who cry to mo=\r\nther for the release.

It=E2=80=99s really&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; painful to=\r\n read such thing from a person of his status whom lot of people&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; considered as a good astro-spiritual personality. Though I am not having=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; scripture references i=E2=80=99ll try to post my humble prot=\r\nest and request to all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; members to understand and study shastr=\r\na deeply for better understanding. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though bel=\r\nievers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; problems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing a=\r\nny&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to acc=\r\nepting that a pudding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; exists even without eating it and remai=\r\nn hungry throughout life. And some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; intelligent people stopped=\r\n believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; why t=\r\nhis has come to be and then talk about what we should do. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Results&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are produced rather bestowed upon the ya=\r\njamana by presiding devata or deity and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; blessings are called =\r\n=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; krupA] Here we think r=\r\nesults are produced; so let us understand the method. If&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; some=\r\nbody wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; perform remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest=\r\n. Here the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; focal point is devata, a supreme authority for thi=\r\ns ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=99s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; behalf priest pray to deva=\r\nta to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire and in return get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\naid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediator or a technician wh=\r\no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; can interact with both parties. And interaction means corre=\r\nct rituals with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; appropriate mantras. So his spiritual or ment=\r\nal strength is not required but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; his skill and knowledge is of=\r\n prime importance. Can we consider a mortal priest&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to bless a=\r\n yajamana? And if a priest can bless yajamana what is the role of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; rituals, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the human =\r\nbeings by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; devatas as only divinity is capable of this. And ma=\r\nny times fruits are not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; received due to karmic blockages of y=\r\najamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=\r\n=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [ in kaliyuga four&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; times efforts are neede=\r\nd] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for doing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bhushu=\r\ndhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; task on the=\r\n part of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; y=\r\najamana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one=\r\n&#39;s bank account, a check given by one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; for thousand dollars is=\r\n meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is a t=\r\nhousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energ=\r\ny cannot bring&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; one any benefits.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yajamana get fruits of the rituals fro=\r\nm the inbuilt bank balance of deities&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and not of a priest. A =\r\npowerhouse of divine energy, called devata can give&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; million d=\r\nollar check to unlimited no of people as GOD has sanctioned rather&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tradition in vedic rituals i=\r\nn any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pooja with or without homa in the beginning there is on=\r\ne ritual called&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BE=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means yajamana nomi=\r\nnate a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf =\r\nand in the end before&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; visarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn =\r\nritual is performed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in which priest gives all shreyas i.e. pu=\r\nnya generated in ritual to yajamana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here we can clearly unde=\r\nrstand the role of priest and the role of deity. As per&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karmi=\r\nc law if you bless some body you lose your punya and blessed one get that&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; share of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can a mor=\r\ntal though highly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as =\r\nhe interacts with many in his lifetime?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This could be possibl=\r\ne only for highly evolved soul like saints and yogis as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; due t=\r\no great penance they do have such powers. But even for them also some time&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; loss of spiritual energy leads for further penance. We read l=\r\not of stories in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ancient mythology of sages enticed by apsarA=\r\ns [superhuman beautiful lady] or if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; they cursed some body res=\r\nults in renewed penances to regain there status.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One important note: The power is not=\r\n in a combination of syllables (mantra)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; or a sequence of phys=\r\nical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; FOCUSES =\r\non a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency =\r\nto&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras=\r\n and rituals as the focus&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; points may generate different kinds=\r\n of energy, but the key is focus. Without&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; it, no mantra or ri=\r\ntual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nost priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought th=\r\nat energy to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; table when they did rituals at the houses of=\r\n people or in temples.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=\r\n [ science of pathway to GOD] and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [science of full feeling de=\r\nsires through devata] i.e. =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=\r\n=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 &nbsp;are two =\r\ndifferent things.

This is puran based&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are having same concept w=\r\nith&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; different terminology. The subtle seat of paravak is at n=\r\naval and creator&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; brahma creates this world with the help of s=\r\naraswati and sarsawati is nothing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati =\r\nis embodiment of syllables. When two unknown person meets first&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; time how they get connected? Through communication and thought is a form=\r\n of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; vak, pashyanti. First there is desire to know each other =\r\nand then communication&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; starts. And in communication if some b=\r\nody express negativity communication&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stops. So for communicat=\r\nion soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; assum=\r\ne that mantra or rituals are of no importance? These show qualities, tools&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; necessary to get connected with devatas in right perspective.=\r\n In scriptures&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. =\r\nwhich denotes the nature of that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; syllable resulting in typica=\r\nl energy. To be precise power rest with desire and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mind is a =\r\nmere tool to channalise that power and strength of desire will decide&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; depth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana, mind is of prie=\r\nst and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro=\r\n treaty like BPHS, sage&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; parAsharA recommended various rituals=\r\n of various devatas for removing bad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; effects of bad dashas or=\r\n bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rituals do =\r\nnot count why Narsimhaji is having so many homa manuals. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To consider spiritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis=\r\n who do have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; dharanA like a solid rock who always rest in Tra=\r\nns or dhyanavashtA need not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; require mantra or tantra, rituals=\r\n for creating energy. A mere wish of them can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; do work. Normal=\r\n people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; patanjali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. A=\r\nnd these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja tra=\r\nditions as mantra, tantra,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; nyas, etc. So for wish to be get f=\r\null filled by devata many many things count. &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;This whole confusion is due=\r\n to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narsimhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality =\r\nand he is doing this with pure&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; heart. Yes, focus mind is one =\r\nof the factors in this whole exercise. Many have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; seen shatach=\r\nandI or mahArudra anushathAna where many priest at a time read or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; chant mantras with different level of mind focus still yajamana get fr=\r\nuits of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; it in terms of desires. This is because devata is ple=\r\nased by offerings, japa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and hOme which in turn bless the yaja=\r\nmana with HIS blessings.&nbsp; For spirituality focus, pure heart and&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; continuous efforts are of prime importance but for getting our des=\r\nires to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fulfilled we need correct procedure, appropriate d=\r\neity and correct mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 is a love relationship BTW jiva and=\r\n parmAtmA =E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 =E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=BE =\r\n=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AE=E0=\r\n=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE; where as =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=\r\n=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=B0 or mantrashAshtra is a give and take relationship =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=A8&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=9E=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A4. In love&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karma =\r\nis not imp but in give and take it is the most imp factor. If someone is&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; named rAm and we call him as ramyA will he be pleased with you?=\r\n Lord krUshna&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; worshiped for begetting child as santangopAla a=\r\nnd same krUshana for bhakti are totally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; different.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;It is a hype o=\r\nf old great priests which we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; constantly hear but there were m=\r\nillions of greedy, money minded priest all the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; time; its huma=\r\nn nature. In every satyayuga we have kaliyuga and that is why&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n RAVANA a great dashgranthi brahmana ran away with sitA. &nbsp;Narsimhaji f=\r\nreely distributing astrology&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; software, lectures, homA manuals=\r\n is a satyayuga in kaliyuga. So don=E2=80=99t blame&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; today=E2=\r\n=80=99s priest; to become perfect in karmakAndA a priest at least give his =\r\nten&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; yeas to become perfect in rituals. In old golden days lif=\r\ne was simple, there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; was =E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=\r\n=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AF and =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AF to bramhana. Kings have had sanctioned =E0=\r\n=A4=85=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0 [some fertile =\r\nland] to all priests in old golden&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; days. &nbsp;And most imp i=\r\nn old golden days&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; also always fruits were given by pleased de=\r\nvatas due to offerings, japa,homA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; etc. and not by personal sa=\r\ndhana of priest. BTW, Sadhana of priest was and is a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; personal=\r\n advantage due to punyakarma [past birth=E2=80=99s good deeds] of yajamana.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;We must&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have gratitude for whole&nbsp; past&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ngenerations &nbsp;for maintaining such a divine&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; science in or=\r\nal tradition for thousands of years with such a accuracy[ they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; know power of syllables, so they maintained sanctity of akashrA, =E0=A4=\r\n=85=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0- =E0=A4=A8 =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=B7=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BF -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; non-perishable ] due to whic=\r\nh we can proclaim ourselves as vedic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; astrologers, yoga gurus,=\r\n vedic healers, vedic mathematicians etc. Yes, we must&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mould =\r\n/ change according to [ =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B6, =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=\r\n=A4=B2, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A4=BF=E0=\r\n=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 ] surroundings, time and environments but we must not let g=\r\no real ethics,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; morals, rules of our ancient proved traditions=\r\n. &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Many people think that poojas to gods=\r\n are a serious matter and only a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; trained priest should do the=\r\nm. The procedures have evolved to become quite&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; complicated ov=\r\ner the time too! However, complexity of rituals should never be a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories every=\r\nday, 40 grams&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Sup=\r\npose you have no access to such&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; balanced food. Will you starv=\r\ne yourself until you find a balanced meal or will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you manage =\r\nwith whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; and rice,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you will simply eat it. You =\r\natleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not know the &quot;p=\r\nerfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; till you=\r\n know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; give you energy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The fear to do ritua=\r\nls without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; notion that som=\r\ne mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; baseless, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to focus the mind on=\r\n some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mantras and rituals and get specific results. When used=\r\n by someone with a high&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; level of spiritual energy, some mantr=\r\nas and rituals may work very fast and give&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; specific powerful =\r\nresults. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhings in this age.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and should be done by exper=\r\nts only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; as these are for special purposes and should be done =\r\nby trained people. There&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are hundreds of ways for GOD realiza=\r\ntion and a single way to fulfill our&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; desires. If you don=E2=\r\n=80=99t know how to drive a car why opt for a fighter plane? &nbsp;&nbsp;On=\r\nly if you elders, gurus have sanctioned it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; then its ok. Natur=\r\ne has not purposely hidden anything but due to loss of energy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. for removing karmic blocks we feel=\r\n we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; need more energy and we are not getting it. Yes, we shoul=\r\nd not wait for perfect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; thing as perfection is subjective matt=\r\ner but we must read study, think, analyze&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; before accepting an=\r\ny concept. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this=\r\n is one of the best ways for acceleration according to my experiences in my=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; twenties but it is for spirituality and for desires to get f=\r\null filled through&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deities every thing counts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of differe=\r\nnt shapes.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; They matter only so much. Depending on what kind o=\r\nf a begging bowl you use, you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; may be given different kind of =\r\nalms. But it is important to start begging with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; some begging =\r\nbowl or the other, instead of spending years looking for the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nperfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ri=\r\ntual, do what your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; heart tells you or what your guru (or an e=\r\nlder you respect) tells you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but anshA of GOD. =E0=A4=\r\n=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=\r\n=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Human being is the best creativity&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; of HIM, the divine. The sole aim of manushyayOnI is to realize HIM. =\r\nIn this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; journey we may face many types of different obstacles=\r\n due to our karma and to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; surpass them HE has given us power a=\r\nnd rights to use our intellect, mind for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; healthy, wealthy and=\r\n peaceful life. And whole karma done for this in a pious&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mann=\r\ner is a sattvic karma. Even for getting fulfilled our desires we do have a&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; relationship of respect, love, gratitude with devatas. Beggar=\r\ns don=E2=80=99t have any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; feelings for donors instead they eve=\r\nn don=E2=80=99t remember them. We are =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=A4=\r\n=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=\r\n=E0=A4=BE; children of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; divinity. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; Yes, unfortunately there are lot of fake astrologers, gurus etc. who are&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; misguiding people;but again there is satyuga in kaliyuga. And=\r\n for everybody,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karma counts resulting in happenings of life.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;Man=\r\ntras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; panchakshari mantra, Vishnu s=\r\nahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hanuman chalis=\r\na, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshar=\r\ni&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, ha=\r\nre krishna mantra,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chandipath (Durga saptashat=\r\ni), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stotra, Vyasa&#39;s na=\r\nvagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi ashto=\r\nttarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; any=\r\none for any purpose.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are m=\r\nany generic mantras (see my original mail at the bottom for a sample list)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that are appliable to everybody and can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; solve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ALL problems. For example, Vishnu sahasranaama =\r\nstotra explicitly says it can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; solve ANY problem. Instead of l=\r\nooking for a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;perfect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mantra rec=\r\nommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic mantra like that and start&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIf&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount =\r\nenergy may be enough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to move it away. If it is the size of a =\r\nbig&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; boulder&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on the other hand, m=\r\nuch more energy may be needed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry =\r\nto spread concept of homa in this world.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, as this concept=\r\n is blessed by divine mother homa is going to be popular&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sadh=\r\nana in coming years. In his anxiety to spread this blessing he is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; contradicting his own words. Mantras do have vargabheda and can be bro=\r\nadly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; categorized as&nbsp; shrutimantra,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; smritim=\r\nantra, puranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex. We can broadly classify savit=\r\nur&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; gayatri as shrutimantra; chandipatha as smrutinmantra; vis=\r\nhnusahastranam as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; puranmantra and shabarimantra[created by gr=\r\neat navanath yogis] as varadamantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The term generic is itse=\r\nlf illusive. Every devata, every mantra is assigned&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; different=\r\n power, different work by cosmic mother.
