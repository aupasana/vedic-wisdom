The place of puja =\r\nis either a Mahapitha or a Devi temple. The text lists the different maiden=\r\ns including Nati (actress), Kapaliki, Rajaki, Napita, Gopala, Brahmani, Vai=\r\nshya, Shudra and Chandala. The girls should be given sweets and other pleas=\r\nant things and treated as forms of the goddess incarnate. The mantras of th=\r\ne Kumaris are given. \n_____________________________________________________=\r\n________________\n\nFurther to this what is of particular interest to me is t=\r\nhat the worship of the goddess as a gopala. \n\nMy humble request to you frie=\r\nnds...would be to throw some light on this aspect. \n\nKind regards\nArunisha\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
