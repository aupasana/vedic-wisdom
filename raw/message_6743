It is lethal, catastrophic mistake and will \n&gt; destroy equilibrium\n&gt; of the cosmos.\n\nMy friend, you have some weird notions. Agni permeates the 14 worlds and \nis responsible for their smooth running. He can take your offering \nanywhere and not just to &quot;heaven&quot;. In homam/yajna, we make offerings to \nvarious beings living in various worlds. For example, in jayadi homam \ndone at the end of various homas, we make offerings to pitris, parvatas, \nbhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.\n\nSecondly, to one who sees Shiva as the supreme being, Shiva does not \n&quot;live in&quot; one place, but he is the underlying reality of everything.\n\nThough Shiva is depicted as living in smashana (cemetary) with spirits, \nit has esoteric significance. I elaborated this in a Sanskrit shloka I \ncomposed just a few days back and you can read it, its meaning and \ncommentary at that: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/6719\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. \n&gt; Not a single\n&gt; scriptural reference could be found out\n\nParasara mentioned making offerings to Shiva in fire with &quot;tryambakam \nyajaamahe&quot; mantra (Mrityunjaya mantra) as a remedy to several horoscopic \nproblems!!\n\nVishnu Dharmottara Purana mentioned Rudra Yajna. Agni Purana also \nmentioned Rudra homam. Mrityunjaya homam to Shiva with Mrityunjaya \nmantra is also mentioned and popular in tradition.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; However there are many references in purans that Lord Shiva was not \n&gt; invited to\n&gt; fire sacrifice conducted by Duksha Prajapati.\n\nIn any homam, the final offerings made are those to Vishnu and Rudra, \nirrespective of what homam it is. What Daksha did was to break the rules \nby doing a &quot;Nirishwara yajna&quot;. He was trying to insult Shiva and he paid \nfor it. It is foolish to take his foolish act as an example to conclude \nthat offerings should not be made to Shiva in fire.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All those \n&gt; who perform\n&gt; such irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTED BY EVERYONE.\n\nIf you think it is &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;, please do not do it! Do homam to \nGanapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody \nelse. Or don&#39;t do homam at all if you please.\n\nBTW, I personally know people doing homam to Shiva and making brisk \nspiritual progress.\n\nIf you really want to &quot;insult and reject&quot; someone, you will be better \noff picking someone killing and raping in the name of god or spreading \nintolerance and hatred in the name of god and religion. Or people \nengaging in so many worse evils on earth today. Why target poor people \nworshipping Shiva in fire!\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself from \n&gt; self titled\n&gt; kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes to you is not a true \n&gt; guru. Don&#39;t\n&gt; fall pray to marketing.\n\nJust for the record, I do not consider myself a guru. If someone \nvoluntarily (and mentally) considers me a guru for the purpose of \nperforming homam, I do not mind it. However, my main role is not to be a \nguru, but to show people their guru. Let me elaborate.\n\nPeople who have access to a good external guru to give a push to one&#39;s \nspiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Otherwise, I am giving \nthem access to a superb external guru who will remain on earth in a \nphysical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), the original \npreceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life \nas your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him everyday \nwith reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the correct \ndirection. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you \nfor better.\n\nAnd, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don&#39;t worry about &quot;falling prey to \nmarketing&quot;. Try homam if you want to and continue if you like it. \nPeriod. No strings attached.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Arun Yadav&quot; &lt;aruninthecity@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jai Shree Rama,\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear List,\n&gt;\n&gt; I usually talk about the degeneration of intellect in kali yuga. In \n&gt; this yuga tamo guna exists in predominance and sattva exists in very \n&gt; marginal potency. As is it impossible to see anything in darkness, \n&gt; people in kali yuga engage themselves in all kind of stupid and \n&gt; foolish things since these their intellect is blinded by the kalyugi \n&gt; darkness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Things like erecting huge buildings which are destined to be shattered \n&gt; and ruined by natural calamities are being considered as object of \n&gt; pride. Even people feel proud to create weapons which are capable of \n&gt; destroying whole humanity within fractions of seconds. If one wants to \n&gt; be proud of anything be proud of an achievement which is not destined \n&gt; to be devastated by eternal time.\n&gt;\n&gt; People are digging deep into earth to set free all evil sprits \n&gt; sleeping in deep realms of hell and using it as fuel as the cost of \n&gt; bringing hell on earth. To compensate for the loss these people have \n&gt; come up with a solution of wearing black, consuming alcohol, tobacco, \n&gt; tea, coffee, chocolate and other such products.\n&gt;\n&gt; Degenerated intellect has bring us to verge in the history that some \n&gt; people are promoting SHIVA HOMA since years and no one of these so \n&gt; called intellectual, scholars and people with wisdom (if anyone left) \n&gt; is coming forward and asking to stop this irreligious practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s very unfortunate that people with no knowledge and understanding \n&gt; of divinity are promoting their irreligious believes without doing any \n&gt; research of ancient Indian scriptures and gullible people are easily \n&gt; falling pray, more pathetic is that no one is coming forward and say \n&gt; that stop this nonsense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. \n&gt; Not a single scriptural reference could be found out where nativity \n&gt; performs Shiva homa to please lord Shiva. However there are many \n&gt; references in purans that Lord Shiva was not invited to fire sacrifice \n&gt; conducted by Duksha Prajapati.\n&gt; Why is it so?\n&gt; It is so because lord Shiva will be accompanied by his ganas who are \n&gt; nothing but demons and evil sprits and presence of anything impure \n&gt; will destroy the fire sacrifice. Things which are pure and sacred in \n&gt; nature are to be offered into homam pit since it is believed that \n&gt; these things will ultimately reach devtas in heaven and nothing impure \n&gt; is ever offered to homam pit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva didn&#39;t live in heaven; by performing fire sacrifice one in \n&gt; try to send lord shiva to heaven. It is lethal, catastrophic mistake \n&gt; and will destroy equilibrium of the cosmos.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva lives in Kalasha parvata and the only way to reach it to \n&gt; try to offer flowers, raw milk, fruits and sweets to shiva lingam. \n&gt; Performing rudrabhishakam is the only correct way to please lord \n&gt; shiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even in Ramayana lord Rama tries to please lord Shiva by worshiping to \n&gt; Shiva lingam. Why didn&#39;t he perform homa?\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All those \n&gt; who perform such irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTED BY \n&gt; EVERYONE.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is good if someone is promoting vedic tradition of homam but before \n&gt; doing so one must properly read religious scripture to understand that \n&gt; which deity can be pleased by performing homa. One should also \n&gt; understand that since pure cow ghee is not easily available and it&#39;s \n&gt; rare to find any people with fully activated Pingala nadi; any homam \n&gt; will not yield satisfactory results. Purity of material offered into \n&gt; homa and purity of the person performing the homa is essential.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a person accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perform homa \n&gt; will only experience malefic results same is true if homam is \n&gt; performed with adulterated butter.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a person not corrupted by vice perform homam with pure cow ghee and \n&gt; tries to please deities living in heaven such as indra, varuna, soma, \n&gt; agni, prajapati etc then such a native is equivalent(or will soon \n&gt; become) to demigods.\n&gt;\n&gt; Same is true for a brahmachari or a yogi who perform internal homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spiritual practices should be \n&gt; followed under the guidance of a bonafide guru. A native without a \n&gt; capable guru is like god without power.\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself from \n&gt; self titled kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes to you is \n&gt; not a true guru. Don&#39;t fall pray to marketing.\n&gt;  Its rare fortune, that native found a true guru. Before that one \n&gt; should build a fort strong enough so that one not fall prey to kalyugi \n&gt; gurus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Arun\n\n"}}
