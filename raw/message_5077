Moreover, it is to=\r\nugh to capture some of these ideas in words, as words convey slightly diffe=\r\nrent meaning to different people, based on their life experiences and predi=\r\nspositions.\n \nYes, there is no formula that ensures self-realization in a c=\r\nertain amount of time and it comes to one through the grace of God. However=\r\n, grace of God does not come to just about anyone - it comes to one who is =\r\n*ready* to receive it. One becomes ready to receive it, through the effort =\r\nput in this life and all previous lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditi=\r\noning. So effort and sadhana are not useless. The effort we are talking abo=\r\nut here is not effort to acquire something, but effort to give up something=\r\n.\n \nThough it is not incorrect, the view that things are given only by God&#39;=\r\ns grace can, when misunderstood, promote inaction. God&#39;s grace does not com=\r\ne to a lazy person doing nothing and waiting for God&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace d=\r\noes not work arbitrarily. God&#39;s grace comes to one who has perfect surrende=\r\nr to God. Perfect surrender does not come automatically. Though effort and =\r\nsadhana do not guarantee perfect surrender in a certain amount of time, the=\r\ny do bring it eventually.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; whatever one does it is=\r\n based on past karmas only\n \nFruits of past karmas decide one&#39;s current sit=\r\nuation and constrain one&#39;s current karmas (actions). But they do not comple=\r\ntely decide one&#39;s current karmas. One&#39;s current karma is in one&#39;s hands (wi=\r\nthin the constraints).\n \nOf course, one can ask: Does one have a free will =\r\nthat acts or does an all-pervading shakti act through one? I am quoting a s=\r\nmall portion from vedic-wisdom message 5009 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:\n \nAll pervading shakti works through all =\r\nof us and expresses through all of our desires, actions and knowledge. But =\r\nthen, some universal rules of action and reaction govern how this works. Un=\r\nder the push of one&#39;s own previous karmas, one is placed in situations that=\r\n are conducive to certain desires, actions and awareness. The current karma=\r\ns in those situations may further modify the momentum of the push (reaction=\r\n) from previous actions. Though one&#39;s current desires, actions and awarenes=\r\ns are actually the work of the all pervading shakti, they are also one&#39;s wo=\r\nrk in a way. It depends on how we look at it and how we abstract it. Though=\r\n Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in a small cup, Ganges water in a c=\r\nup in hot weather and Ganges water in a cup in freezing weather are all Gan=\r\nges water, they are different too. One is more, one is less, one is warm an=\r\nd one is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading shakti is\ndifferent when=\r\n expressed through different vessels (people) in different situations.\n\nAs =\r\nlong as one actually feels internally (despite what one may say or pretend =\r\nexternally) that one&#39;s desires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s own, one is=\r\n performing karmas and is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. Only wh=\r\nen the\nrealization that it is all the work of the all pervading shakti beco=\r\nmes full and completely internalized, does one become free from the cycle o=\r\nf actions and reactions. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one =\r\nto give appropriate reactions to actions one thinks one is performing.\n \n* =\r\n       *        *\n \nIn astrological terms, horoscope is the sum total of pr=\r\nevious karmas, whose fruits one will have to face. They show the circumstan=\r\nces faced by one. They do not and cannot determine what actions one engages=\r\n in, though certain actions are more likely in certain circumstances.\n \nDes=\r\ntiny is the sum total of the reactions to the actions committed by one&#39;s fr=\r\nee will. Today&#39;s actions of free will become destiny tomorrow (i.e. on a fu=\r\nture date or in a future life).\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Softwar=\r\ne, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; r=\r\nitual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://Sarasw=\r\natiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- h=\r\nramalingam@... wrote: \n&gt; Samadi state is not like getting a degree by=\r\n hardwork It comes to certain people by the Grace of GOD Till GOD or Soul d=\r\necides to reveal the Samadi state whatever one does it is based on past kar=\r\nmas only\n&gt; Ramanapatham\n&gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile,=\r\n India&#39;s No. 1 Network.

However, we cannot compare ourselve=\r\ns with special beings and we should follow rules and austerities laid out i=\r\nn tradition. Tendulkar may score a century with a terrible backache, but we=\r\n should not walk out to bat with a backache and should try to be healthy. A=\r\nfter all, we may not be able to score runs well even when in perfect health=\r\n!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; By the way, it must be realized that exte=\r\nrnal rules are only meant as a *catalyst* in enabling internal transformati=\r\non. The goal of all sadhana - meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, service to =\r\nothers etc - is internal transformation. If the internal attitude is not ge=\r\ntting refined, sadhana is yet to work.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If a=\r\n room has a window outside of which there is heavy wind that is constantly =\r\nblowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweeping the room with a broom does no=\r\nt eliminate dirt. First close the window or stop the wind. Similarly, praan=\r\naayaama is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental purity, if mind (=\r\nroom) is attached to the objects perceived by senses (window).\n&gt;  \n&gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one reads scriptures and teachings of saints, contem=\r\nplates on them, constantly analyzes inner motives behind various actions by=\r\n oneself and tries to change one&#39;s own thinking slowly, this process of con=\r\ntemplation and introspection will augment one&#39;s external sadhana (such as m=\r\neditation, japam, homam, bhajan, service etc) and purifies one faster.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; By the way, it is useless to think in terms of =\r\nKundalini, awakening Kundalini and raising Kundalini. Such thoughts are alm=\r\nost guaranteed to either block Kundalini from rising or from reaching the h=\r\nighest it can.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbol of one&#39;s own =\r\nself-awareness. Though one is the infinite Self (Purusha), one is &quot;aware&quot; o=\r\nf a limited object in the field of duality (Shakti) springing in Self as &quot;s=\r\nelf&quot;. That is why Kundalini shakti is worshipped as a form of the divine Mo=\r\nther (Shakti). This self-awareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes=\r\n that one is so and so person and so and so body without questioning &quot;who a=\r\nm I&quot;. That is why Kundalini is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (=\r\nbhuloka or physical realm). As Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras=\r\n (other lokas or realms of awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who one is ge=\r\nts refined. When Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true Self.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at so and so=\r\n point in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in this body&quot;, i=\r\nt will focus and limit one&#39;s self-awareness to the *physical body* and henc=\r\ne one&#39;s Kundalini will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise,=\r\n one needs to completely forget about the physical body and stop thinking i=\r\nn terms of it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; By the way, *very few* people actually experience Kund=\r\nalini in higher chakras, though many talk about it. Kundalini is in Moolaad=\r\nhaara chakra or atmost Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even advanced an=\r\nd awakened ones. When praana vaayu flows in some higher chakras, that too c=\r\nan result in a powerful experience. Some may mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you want a good score in the examination, s=\r\ntudy well. Stop thinking too much about (and anticipating) the examination =\r\nand focus on the subject instead. Study, study, study. Similarly, forget ab=\r\nout kundalini, forget about chakras, forget about the body even. Do sadhana=\r\n, do sadhana and do sadhana. Read scriptures and teachings of great saints.=\r\n Instead of looking externally and judging others, observe your own actions=\r\n and thoughts, analyze what is driving them and consciously try to eliminat=\r\ne wrong motives that stem from false ego, adharma and arishadvarga (lust, a=\r\nnger, greed, delusion, wantonness, jealosy), i.e. put to use the knowledge =\r\nof scriptures and the teachings of saints. Oneday, Kundalini will rise auto=\r\nmatically.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                     http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &quot;For instance, without a vegetarian diet, a=\r\nsana siddhi is impossible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Nothing is impossible.
