Yet they had to do whatever was\npo=\r\nssible in a spirit of detachment leaving the result to the Lord. As long\nas=\r\n she was conscious, Bhagavan gave her spiritual instructions. When she\nlost=\r\n consciousness Ganapati Muni\nand others commenced vedic chants, some others=\r\n chanted the Rama-nama.\n\nAfter the violent gasps (urdhva-swasa) began, Bhag=\r\navan placed his right hand\non her heaving heart and the left one on her hea=\r\nd. He looked at her\nintently. The day passed that way. Subsequently Bhagava=\r\nn himself narrated\nwhat had happened thus:\n\nThe latent tendencies and thoug=\r\nhts which are the cause of future births\nflared up. She had just then lost =\r\nconsciousness of the external world. Hence\nin the subtle world her subtle b=\r\nody was witnessing scene after scene of what\nwas to happen. By this sequenc=\r\ne of experiences, the soul went through the\nfuture births and travelled tow=\r\nards the highest.\n\nHow could she experience this? It was because of the cur=\r\nrent of Bhagavan&#39;s\nspiritual power transmitted by touch that she experience=\r\nd all within\nherself, without having to be born over and over again. There =\r\nwas a battle\nbetween her soul forces and Bhagavan&#39;s spiritual power in whic=\r\nh her latent\ntendencies gradually weakened and ultimately got vanquished. B=\r\nhagavan\nactually described the scenes she witnessed in the subtle state inc=\r\nluding\ntheir intensity.\n\nThe end came peacefully by eight in the night. Amo=\r\nng those present, Ganapati\nand Niranjanananda Swami heard a sound indicativ=\r\ne of the mother&#39;s death.\n\nIn this manner, the mother&#39;s individuality submer=\r\nged in Atma, God. She\nattained mahanirvana. She had no more births. Due to =\r\nher son, who was\nArunachala in human form, she attained mukti or became est=\r\nablished in the\nAtma.\n\nMother&#39;s body acquired a new brilliance which persis=\r\nted till the abhisheka\non the following day As the mother&#39;s end was nearing=\r\n nobody in the ashram\nate anything that day. After her end, the Maharshi go=\r\nt up, and with no trace\nof grief said, &quot;We may now eat. There is no polluti=\r\non.&quot; How could there be\nany pollution when they were in the presence of the=\r\n Lord in whom the holy\nlady merged? Such a body was a holy shrine in itself=\r\n. The ashramites had a\nquiet meal.\n\n\nThe entire night passed in the singing=\r\n of devotional songs. According to\nManavasi Ramaswamy Iyer, &quot;Bhagavan had n=\r\no grief whatever. On the other hand,\nhe appeared to be relieved like a bird=\r\n released from a cage.&quot; These words\nwere recorded in his diary. True, why d=\r\nid he have to grieve?\n\nThe mother attained the supreme state. Some days aft=\r\ner the event somebody\nremarked to the Maharshi, &quot;Mother has passed away.&quot; I=\r\nmmediately Bhagavan\ncorrected him saying &quot;No, mother has merged, she has be=\r\ncome one.&quot;\n\nOn another occasion, when the matter of his according mukti to =\r\nthe mother\ncame up, Bhagavan said, &quot;Yes my attempt in her case was successf=\r\nul. Earlier,\nin the case of Palaniswami I attempted the same. Thinking that=\r\n he had\nattained the ultimate I removed my hand, thereupon he opened his ey=\r\nes. The\nprana passed through the eyes. That is how my attempt at that time =\r\nfailed.&quot;\nOn still another occasion, Bhagavan said, &quot;Where has mother gone? =\r\nShe is\nhere.&quot; Hence there need be no doubt as to where Alagammal had depart=\r\ned. The\nMaharashi meant that she merged in Easwara and was with him (as he =\r\nalso was\nabiding in the atma).\n\nMother has not passed away. She has merged.=\r\n She has become one.\n\nThe question as to whether the body was to be cremate=\r\nd or buried came up on\nthe very night of mother&#39;s expiry.\n\nBhagavan pointed=\r\n out that according to chapter 13 of Ramana Gita the body of\none who attain=\r\ned mukti was to be buried and not cremated. The disciples\ndecided to bury t=\r\nhe body. Early next dawn, they carried the body from\nSkandasramam down the =\r\nhill to a spot near Paliteertham.\n\nMeanwhile, some relatives from other pla=\r\nces came and though they argued in\nfavour of a cremation, they were overrul=\r\ned. The news of the mother&#39;s death\npassed round the town, in spite of every=\r\n effort to keep it private. As a\nresult, numerous people turned up at the b=\r\nurial ground.Your text goes here.\n\nA pit was dug below an aswatha tree. The=\r\n body was lowered into it. The pit\nwas filled with camphor, vibhuti, salt a=\r\nnd other aromatic materials and\nlater covered. The disciples erected a bric=\r\nk samadhi and by some\ncoincidence, a Siva linga from Kasi arrived just then=\r\n. It was placed atop\nthe samadhi and named, Matrubhuteswara (Mother who was=\r\n Easwara).\n\nThe Swami was watching the proceedings as a mere witness.With t=\r\nhe samadhi of\nthe mother the son&#39;s filial duty ended.\n\nAs Swami had entreat=\r\ned Arunachala in 1914, the mother was consumed not by\nthe fire of cremation=\r\n but by the fire of Jnana .\n\nFor the Mahapooja day, Ganapati Muni wrote six=\r\n verses entitled Soundaryamba\nshatkam (Six verses on Soundaryamba) ? (Sound=\r\naryamba has the same meaning as\nAlagamma). This is the substance of the ver=\r\nses:\n\n1. In the first quarter of the night of Friday, the ninth day of the =\r\ndark\nfortnight of Vaisakha month, Dundubhi year\n\n2. Wife of Sundaram born i=\r\nn the exalted lineage of Bharadwaja, Parasara and\nmother of Ramana Maharshi=\r\n born as an avatara of Guruguha (Subrahmanya), the\nblessed lady,\n\n3. One de=\r\nvoid of any attachment, one cleansed by bhakti to Siva, one whose\nprana was=\r\n arrested by the touch of Guha (Ramana Maharshi), one whose\ntendencies were=\r\n all destroyed that very moment\n\n4. She, Soundaryamba, became that Light wh=\r\nich can be known only by the\nVedantic Vakyas, which is all-pervasive, and w=\r\nhich was known by her son.\n\n5. At that samadhi of Soundaryamba the stream w=\r\nhich poured out of the lotus\npalms of Ramana Maharshi became a new teertha,=\r\n the Aghasamana teertha (the\nteertha which removes all sins).\n\n6. Glory to =\r\nthe holy mother of sacred Ramana!\nGlory to the samadhi!\nGlory to the linga =\r\nconsecrated by the Maharshi!\nGlory to the new Aghasamana teertha!\n\nThe Maha=\r\nrshi later said something interesting. After her passing away,\nAlagammal&#39;s =\r\nbody acquired a new brilliance which persisted till the\nabhisheka on the fo=\r\nllowing\nday at the time of samadhi; it disappeared soon after water was pou=\r\nred.\nFurther, at the last breath in all cases a faint sound emanates. In th=\r\ne\nmother&#39;s case, Bhagavan did not notice it but others present did.\n\nEvery =\r\nyear, to commemorate the anniversary, pooja is performed to\nMatrubhuteswara=\r\n.
