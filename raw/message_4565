My idea of =\r\nhow politics ought to be is so way out of the radar of\nexisting ideas that =\r\nI would place it somewhere about two thousand years in the\nfuture.&nbsp; Wh=\r\nen I was three I felt sure\nthat I had been born either on the wrong world o=\r\nr the right world at the wrong\ntime. I still feel like that seventy years l=\r\nater :- )&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align=\r\n: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;times new roman&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt; \n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Ap=\r\nple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;times new roman&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;So, I am not the most popular\ncritter that eve=\r\nr walked the face of the globe.
