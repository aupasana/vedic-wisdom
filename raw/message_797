His reasoning was that an \n*Imaginery creation* of some poet can never=\r\n Inspire & attract \nmillions of people for thousans of years.\n\n2) If Mahars=\r\nhi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat to \nsatisfy his poetic =\r\ngenious then how come he himself features in the \nstory? if let&#39;s consider =\r\neven that as a possibility but then WHY \nhe&#39;ll write another book just on S=\r\nhri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why \nhe&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik =\r\nPaatra&#39;.\n\n3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so many Saints o=\r\nf \nyesteryears, saw his form.\nOne can argue that becuase of their intense w=\r\norship of that \nperticular Form, they could see the same form of the suprem=\r\ne \nreality...the supreme power can take any form for the Bhakta.\nThe solid =\r\ncounter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and \nMaharshi Aurobindo, it =\r\nseems, never were a Devotee of that form of \nShri Krishna, then how come in=\r\n their case, without devotion & desire \nthey got to see the form of Shri Kr=\r\nushna?\n\n!....!....!\n\nAny thoughts about this? How to conclusively establish=\r\n the Truth in \nthis case?\n\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
