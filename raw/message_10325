One thinks to shift house to g=\r\net better amenities, more comfort, peace, happiness, security and good neig=\r\nhborhood etc. so in any event the change must bring betterment and not a re=\r\nverse progress.\nIf you wanted to learn to ride a bicycle, can you start at =\r\nany time, any where, any manner? \nObviously no. The time should be such tha=\r\nt there is plenty of light, no stormy wind, no dust, no rain, no traffic ob=\r\nstruction. The place should not be an up-elevated road or area, because tha=\r\nt requires cycling with more effort . It should be sloping, so that the cyc=\r\nle goes freely and you can concentrate on road and balancing. So you need t=\r\no select a time, place and procedure.\nSimilarly for anything to be done the=\r\nre are right times, right procedures, right places etc.\nIn a new house( whe=\r\nre you are going to shift) there may be some families or individuals before=\r\n you enter. The premises get used to the behavior of those, the negative op=\r\nposite energy is likely to be present there. So you have to neutralize thes=\r\ne negative unwanted energies from the premises by chanting of Vedic hymns, =\r\nFire and Water rituals etc. the timings are linked with the motion of plane=\r\nts out of which everyone knows about Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury,Mar=\r\ns, Saturn eats. The individually and as a group create certain energies and=\r\n situations. So the person moving there should get compatibility with such =\r\ngroup activity.\nSo is always better that we choose a time, a day, a manner =\r\nof entering and c,\nLeaning before entering.\nHence it is advisable that to l=\r\nook for an auspicious time which to some extent reduce the unnecessary prob=\r\nlems and start a prosperous future life.\nHouse warming is to create such po=\r\nsitive energies and also to clear the previous pollution by the earlier dwe=\r\nllers. It may as convenient as possible. A Fire ritual called Homa, a water=\r\n ritual called abhishekam, a cleaning ritual called Punyahavachanam,  a poo=\r\nja with chanting Vedic hymns etc.\nIt is also dependent on the purpose of th=\r\ne entering the house. When you wanted to stay for  a longer duration , you =\r\nhave to enter at a time when Sun is in A fixed sign like Leo. A cardinal or=\r\n moving sign results in quick shift from that event. If you wanted to go to=\r\n a hospital at your choice, select a  movable sign for hospital admission, =\r\nif you can wait, so that you will not be fixed to hospital.\nIf you want to =\r\nstrike it wrong on the face of it, you will loose lot of the facility and h=\r\nappiness given by nature.\nSo final answer is chose an auspicious time, do s=\r\nome kind do house warming, get to the type of previous dwellers, and if you=\r\n want to stay for long duration do it in a fixed sign, I.e. Sun in a fixed =\r\nsign like Leo. From 21st June to 21st July Sun will be in cancer a cardinal=\r\n sign and later after July 22nd, in Leo and Sravana Masa please shift.\nIf y=\r\nou have strong will and leadership qualities and strength, you can do it on=\r\n any day, provided your good nature, service, sacred character, love and he=\r\nlping nature and disciplined life will assist you in all measures of good w=\r\nork in spite of any day.\nLoving blessings\nKBKM.\n\nSent from my iPad\n\n&gt; On Ju=\r\nn 17, 2014, at 5:31 PM, &quot;jvsrilatha@...
