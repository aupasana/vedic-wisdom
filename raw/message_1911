He is a doctor \nworking as a nuclear medicine consultant. He does not have many sishyas. He \ncontacted me a few years back with a message, I reluctantly kept in touch, I \nfinally started the sadhana he asked me to do, I went through a spiritual \ntransformation and slowly understood him better. Several mystical \nexperiences, some of which I shared here in the past, made the skeptic in me \nrealize some important things about him. But, it is possible that people \nliving close to him and interacting with him everyday do not know about his \nspiritual attainment.\n\nHe wanted to stay out of limelight, but the command of the Divine Mother on \nspreading homam brought him into indirect limelight. I do not know what the \nMother wants in future.\n\nThere is no literature on him, except some mails in the past on \nvedic-wisdom. In fact, he will laugh if I mention this mail to him.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 01, 2009 4:31 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Touched by Shirdi Sai Baba: A true story\n\n&gt; Posts like this are rare on the net .Simply reading it charges one\n&gt; divinely.\n&gt;\n&gt; Narasimhaji is there any book on the life history of Dr.Manish Pandit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thnks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned my guru Dr Manish Pandit and the command of the Divine Mother\n&gt;&gt; when she appeared before him in March 2006 regarding teaching simple\n&gt;&gt; homam procedures to people. I want to mention a small story about his\n&gt;&gt; past. This is an incident that had a profound impact on his spiritual\n&gt;&gt; evolution in this life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When Manish was young, he was not exactly spiritual. His mother was\n&gt;&gt; highly spiritual and religious and he naturally knew some prayers, but\n&gt;&gt; did not do much spiritual sadhana. He would race motor bikes outside Pune\n&gt;&gt; with friends and lead a licentious lifestyle.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When in college, he got bad marks in one subject in exams and wanted to\n&gt;&gt; go to college oneday to fight and increase his marks. When he was about\n&gt;&gt; to leave house, a teenaged Brahmin in orange clothes and having good\n&gt;&gt; tejas in face came to his house. He asked Manish where he was going. He\n&gt;&gt; then said, &quot;do not go out today. Going out today will ruin your life.\n&gt;&gt; Just stay home and think of god. I will make sure that your marks with be\n&gt;&gt; increased. Leave it to me and don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He then strongly\n&gt;&gt; suggested to Manish that he should wear a diamond ring on his right hand\n&gt;&gt; index finger and it would change his life. Interestingly, Manish has\n&gt;&gt; Meena lagna and Venus is a malefic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th\n&gt;&gt; house) with 3 other planets, people would normally avoid diamond in this\n&gt;&gt; case to be safe. Moreover, most people do not put diamond on index\n&gt;&gt; finger, which is associated with Jupiter, an enemy of Venus. So nobody\n&gt;&gt; would normally recommend him diamond, that too on the index finger. This\n&gt;&gt; is an unusual suggestion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That brahmin boy then asked Manish to give him tea or sugar with his hand\n&gt;&gt; and said that this act would do him good. There was no tea at their house\n&gt;&gt; and Manish fed him some sugar. He ate it and left after saying, &quot;when you\n&gt;&gt; come to Shirdi next, come to so and so room in so and so place. That is\n&gt;&gt; where I live. Also, I need to give a glass of water to your mother.\n&gt;&gt; Please come to Shirdi with her.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Barely a minute after he left, Manish had a question and ran to the door\n&gt;&gt; of his compound wall. He found no person in orange clothes walking on the\n&gt;&gt; road. He asked the persons standing outside whether they could tell him\n&gt;&gt; in which direction a person who came out of the house in orange clothes\n&gt;&gt; had gone. They said nobody went in or came out of the house in an hour.\n&gt;&gt; Manish went around the area to check if anybody saw a young Brahmin in\n&gt;&gt; orange clothes. Nobody in that area saw anyone like that. So this seemed\n&gt;&gt; like a miracle. Manish was puzzled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Later his marks in the exam were automatically increased and his problem\n&gt;&gt; was solved by itself, without his doing anything.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A few months later, they went to Shirdi. They wanted to meet that young\n&gt;&gt; Brahmin. They went to the place he mentioned. Manish&#39;s mother was waiting\n&gt;&gt; downstairs and they went upstairs to the room number mentioned by him to\n&gt;&gt; find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody in that room and there was a\n&gt;&gt; life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wall. When they asked, they\n&gt;&gt; were told that that room had always been empty and only the picture was\n&gt;&gt; there. Nobody ever lived in that room.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When they came downstairs, Manish&#39;s mother told them that she suddenly\n&gt;&gt; became very thirsty and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink\n&gt;&gt; some water from his hands and left in a hurry.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After this, Manish did buy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine\n&gt;&gt; visitor and wore it on his right hand index finger. He still wears it.\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps wearing a strong moksha trikona lord&#39;s gem on the moksha finger\n&gt;&gt; (the four fingers represent the 4 purusharthas and thumb shows self)\n&gt;&gt; strengthens moksha trikona. Though this was an unusual (and risky)\n&gt;&gt; suggestion, perhaps this is very appropriate in this case for spiritual\n&gt;&gt; progress.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Soon after this, another miraculous incident involving a deity happened,\n&gt;&gt; which I do not want to mention now. Then started his spiritual\n&gt;&gt; transformation. Manish became very serious about spiritual sadhana after\n&gt;&gt; that and started spending many hours everyday in spiritual sadhana. He\n&gt;&gt; had visions - internal and external - of many deities and special beings,\n&gt;&gt; including Shirdi Sai Baba too, and had many experiences. His life changed\n&gt;&gt; completely after this experience.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Today many people do not believe that miraculous and magical things can\n&gt;&gt; happen. When they hear unbelievable stories about saints like Sai Baba,\n&gt;&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Mahavatar\n&gt;&gt; Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds trained in rational\n&gt;&gt; thinking assume that the stories are made up by someone. Healthy\n&gt;&gt; skepticism is justified because many fake people are there today, who\n&gt;&gt; abuse people&#39;s faith. However, absolute cynicism is wrong. Such things\n&gt;&gt; are possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But one word on miracles and siddhis. Miracles and siddhis are secondary\n&gt;&gt; to self-realization. The important thing is to do spiritual sadhana,\n&gt;&gt; realize self, and live as a liberated person (jeevanmukta) continuing to\n&gt;&gt; discharge the job assigned to one by Nature, with an equanimous mind and\n&gt;&gt; neither attraction nor repulsion to anything. Nature assigns different\n&gt;&gt; jobs to different persons. Personalities like Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi,\n&gt;&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar\n&gt;&gt; Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramanujacharya,\n&gt;&gt; Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did different jobs on this earth, but what\n&gt;&gt; is common between them is that they completely overcame their limited\n&gt;&gt; personalities, became realized and then went on to fulfill the tasks\n&gt;&gt; given to them by the Power that runs the universe, with an equanimous\n&gt;&gt; mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
