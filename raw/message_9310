If one wants to u=\r\nse=A0 puranas but ignore vedangas, or use tantras but ignore puranas or use=\r\n upanishads but ignore tantras, etc, one may miss some clues and may not be=\r\n able to put it all together.\n=A0\nJyotisha is a vedanga and said to be the =\r\n&quot;eye&quot; of Veda. It supplies a framwework to understand this creation and how=\r\n One Self relates to many selves. It is not a wise idea to dump Parasara&#39;s =\r\nteachings on core philosophy just because they do not seem to fit one&#39;s vie=\r\nws. Instead, I suggest trying harder to understand.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIf one is uncomfortable with Rama-Sun and =\r\nKrishna-Moon link and thinks it belittles Krishna, perhaps one misunderstoo=\r\nd something. Let me try to address a few possible misconceptions.\n=A0\nSun s=\r\nhows soul and Moon shows mind, but that soul is not the same as &quot;Aatman&quot;. A=\r\natman or Brahman is The Self that manifests as everything that exists. Indi=\r\nvidual soul and mind are both specific and limited manifestations of Self a=\r\nnd one cannot say which is superior. In fact, they are incomplete without t=\r\nhe other and are a team that work *together*. In fact, they are two sides o=\r\nf the same thing.\n=A0\nSame is true with Shiva tattva and Shakti tattva repr=\r\nesented by soul (Sun) and mind (Moon). Neither is complete without the othe=\r\nr.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFirst, let us as=\r\nk: What is Shiva tattva and what is Shakti tattva?\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;I understand Shiva=\r\n tattwa as detachment. Shakti tattwa is any form and manner and display of =\r\nShakti (this is the most fluid definition).&gt;&gt;\n=A0\nRajarshi, that is not a &quot;=\r\nfluid definition&quot; but a NON-definition - defining Shakti as Shakti.\n=A0\nIf =\r\nShiva tattva is detachment, is Shakti tattva attachment?? If Shakti tattva =\r\nis about display of shakti, is Shiva tattva about hiding of Shakti or havin=\r\ng no Shakti? I think these cliched definitions are not particularly insight=\r\nful.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;Shiva is Unm=\r\nanifested Absolute&gt;&gt;\n=A0\nThough people sometimes say that Shiva is the unma=\r\nnifested Self, it is just a manner of speaking and not accurate. Shiva and =\r\nShakti are both *manifestations* arising from Self, whose play manifests so=\r\n many other beings. Neither is really identical to unmanifested Self.\n=A0\nT=\r\nhis is my &quot;fluid definition&quot;: Shiva tattva is the cosmic *potential* energy=\r\n of manifested consciousness and Shakti tattva is its cosmic *kinetic* ener=\r\ngy.\n=A0\nAs Shiva tattva allows one close to being established in Self to re=\r\nmain so, while Shakti tattva may draw one away from it, people loosely say =\r\nthat Shiva is the unmanifested Self. But that is not accurate. Also, Shakti=\r\n tattva has 2 aspects. The force of this kinetic energy can work in two way=\r\ns - the force of Maya Shakti pulls beings away from Self and creates many b=\r\nusy selves, whereas the force of Chit Shakti takes one back.\n=A0\nPotential =\r\nenergy is the reservoir from which kinetic energy is generated/increased. T=\r\nhus, Shiva is the source of Shakti and there is no Shakti without Shiva. On=\r\n the other hand, unless it is converted to kinetic energy and put to use, p=\r\notential energy has no meaning or purpose. Even its existence may be questi=\r\noned. Just as sunrays do not exist without Sun while Sun has no meaning or =\r\npurpose without sunrays (even his existence may be questioned then), Shiva =\r\nand Shakti are incomplete without the other. Just as Sun and sunrays illumi=\r\nne everything together, Shiva and Shakti manifest this entire cosmos *toget=\r\nher*.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOne may imagi=\r\nne Shiva as a detached person sitting in smashan and meditating. But that i=\r\ns just one aspect and one imagery. Detachment does not mean disinterest or =\r\ninaction.\n=A0\nIf you look at Puranas and Tantras, so much of the knowledge =\r\nwas taught by Shiva to Parvati (or vice versa). Shiva is of course a great =\r\nscholar and expert in all things you mentioned when questioning Hanuman bei=\r\nng Shiva tattva (&quot;an expert in all forms of music, expert in poetry, expert=\r\n in grammer/logic, expert in speech, a pundit of the highest order, a very =\r\nmultifaceted character&quot;).\n=A0\nAlso, consider the imagery of Shiva being fie=\r\nrcely angry when his wife Sati being insulting and giving up her life and S=\r\nhiva wreaking havoc on Daksha&#39;s yajnashala. Does that come across as detach=\r\nment to you? You quoted incidents from Rama&#39;s life like crying for Sita to =\r\nquestion his &quot;detachment&quot;. Though such incidents in Rama&#39;s life do go again=\r\nst cliched understanding of detachment and Shiva tattva, you have to realiz=\r\ne that Shiva himself had similar incidents.\n=A0\nSub-consciously, some peopl=\r\ne may associate detachment with disinterest or aloofness or not caring or i=\r\nnaction. That is incorrect. Detachment is internal. It is possible to be ca=\r\nlm and stone-faced externally, while there is deep attachment internally. I=\r\nt is also possible to behave angrily or passionately while there is no atta=\r\nchment in the heart. Detachment is an internal state and not a property of =\r\nexternal signs. When you are looking at actions of higher beings, be more a=\r\nware of this. Most importantly, if one starts taking things with deep esote=\r\nric meaning at a superficial external level, one will start having all conf=\r\nusions.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIt is not t=\r\nhat Shiva does not care or is disinterested in worldly things. After all, h=\r\ne is the reservoir of potential energy that runs the cosmos. Shakti extract=\r\ns energy from him and puts it to use by converting into kinetic energy.\n=A0=\r\n\nNow, Shiva is disinterested in the sense that he absolutely does not care =\r\nfor what purpose the energy is used by Shakti. Whatever it is, he unfailing=\r\nly and uncomplainingly provides Shakti with the energy she needs.\n=A0\nYou c=\r\nan look at Shakti as an aspect of Shiva that puts *his* energy to use and y=\r\nou can also look Shiva as an aspect of Shakti that stores *her* energy. The=\r\ny are a team that work together managing this field of duality and insepara=\r\nble really. They can be viewed as one also.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nAs soul is a spark of Shiva tattva and mind is a s=\r\npark of shakti tattva, the same holds in the case of soul and mind of indiv=\r\nidual beings. Soul provides the support mind needs for its various pursuits=\r\n. Whatever activity one engages in, it is not possible without the willing =\r\nsupport of soul. But it is happening because mind envisioned it and wanted =\r\nit. Again, soul and mind are a team and two sides of the same coin of indiv=\r\nidual consciousness.\n=A0\nAll of us do have soul and mind. Rama and Krishna =\r\nalso had them. But my point was that Rama&#39;s life is a story representation =\r\nof how an individual soul operates at an esoteric level and serves its purp=\r\nose. Similarly, Krishna&#39;s life is a story representation of how a perfected=\r\n mind operates at an esoterical level and serves its purpose.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOne disagreement we had was w.=\r\nr.t. &quot;full&quot; avataras. Just to re-iterate, I don&#39;t believe in &quot;full&quot; avatara=\r\ns as you envision. In the analogy below, Ganga water is paramatmamsa and ta=\r\np water is jivatmamsa.\n=A0\nMany vessels may contain tap water with a few dr=\r\nops of Ganga water added (a normal being). Some vessels may contain 40% tap=\r\n water and 60% Ganga water (amsavatara). Some rare vessels may contain 100%=\r\n Ganga water (poornavatara). But no vessel can contain &quot;Full Ganga&quot;, which =\r\ncan only flow outside and not fit in any vessel! The reason you take Ganga =\r\nwater in a vessel is for a specific purpose and you just take a vessel that=\r\n suits the purpose.\n=A0\nSame thing holds with avataras. Ethereal beings exi=\r\nst in their &quot;full&quot; form ethereally. When they take a form on earth, it is w=\r\nhat suffices the purpose. It is like a vessel holding Ganga water.\n=A0\nIf t=\r\nhe vessel itself claims &quot;don&#39;t think that I am this vessel, I am Ganga wate=\r\nr itself&quot;, it is not incorrect. But it is also not correct if you understan=\r\nd that that particular vessel is the best and contains &quot;full Ganga&quot;.\n=A0\n*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nNow let me extend this a=\r\nnalogy to the basic disagreement that started this whole discussion.\n=A0\nTh=\r\nere were 9 vessels. First vessel was very small (fish form). Next vessel wa=\r\ns bigger (more evolved turtle form). Next vessel is bigger (boar). Next ves=\r\nsel was even bigger (half-man). Next vessel was bigger (full man, but dwarf=\r\n). Next vessel was bigger (full man, but passionate). Next vessel was bigge=\r\nr. Next vessel was the same size, but had a very nice design and some prais=\r\ned it as &quot;Ganga water itself&quot;. Next vessel was the same size, but having ve=\r\nry plain design.\n=A0\nSomeone (Rajarshi) came along and said, &quot;I see a clear=\r\n pattern of evolution of purity. So the last vessel does not belong. Throw =\r\nit out.&quot; He also said that the 8th vessel was Ganga itself.\n=A0\nSomeone els=\r\ne (Narasimha) came along and said, &quot;well, vessels 3, 4, 7 and 8 are filled =\r\nwith 100% Ganga water, while vessels 5 and 6 are not. Don&#39;t conclude that a=\r\nbout purity from the outside and look inside.&quot; He also said that no vessel =\r\nwas Ganga itself, though 4 vessels contained 100% Ganga water.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nLet me be absolutely clear abo=\r\nut one thing. Though it may have seemed like Rajarshi was batting for Krish=\r\nna and I for Rama, I do not have such divisions in my mind. Though Shiva & =\r\nShakti or soul & mind play slightly different roles, I see them as two aspe=\r\ncts of a single manifestation. In fact, I suggest that one cannot understan=\r\nd Shiva tattva perfectly without also understanding Shakti tattva perfectly=\r\n, and vice versa. I will in fact say the same thing about Rama tattva and K=\r\nrishna tattva.\n=A0\nAlso, I always like focusing on the boundaries of differ=\r\nences of opinion with like-minded people, to improve collective understandi=\r\nng.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&gt; I rest my cas=\r\ne!-:)\n=A0\nYes Rajarshi, your &quot;case&quot; is really tired from jumping all over t=\r\nhe place frantically and do please give it some &quot;rest&quot;! ;-)\n=A0\nSeriously t=\r\nhough, I share my thoughts with you not because my knowledge is perfect or =\r\nsuperior, but because sharing what I see may oneday contribute towards perf=\r\nect knowledge in *someone*. There are some really sincere seekers of Arsha =\r\nVidya here. You are especially at the forefront of them, Rajarshi. So I res=\r\npectfully, humbly and lovingly submit my confident, but fallible, views.\n=\r\n=A0\nBest wishes for Rishi Panchami again!\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n---\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n----=\r\n----\r\n---1593584224-127308093-1368583083=:58782\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4000797454&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4000797454&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv400079=\r\n7454yui_3_7_2_28_1368548960848_62&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4000797454yui_3_7_2_28_136=\r\n8548960848_63&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv4000797454yui_3_7_2_28_1368548960848_55&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-ser=\r\nif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Dear Rajarshi and others,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On this auspicio=\r\nus Rishi Panchami day, may the blessings of rishis be with us in our pursui=\r\nt of Arsha Vidya!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Subtle teachings of rishis need to be unders=\r\ntood &quot;holistically&quot;.

But that =\r\nis not accurate. Also, Shakti tattva has 2 aspects. The force of this kinet=\r\nic energy can work in two ways - the force of Maya Shakti pulls\n beings awa=\r\ny from Self and creates many busy selves, whereas the force of Chit Shakti =\r\ntakes one back.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Potential energy is the reservoir from which k=\r\ninetic energy is generated/increased. Thus, Shiva is the source of Shakti a=\r\nnd there is no Shakti without Shiva. On the other hand, unless it is conver=\r\nted to kinetic energy and put to use, potential energy has no meaning or pu=\r\nrpose. Even its existence may be questioned. Just as sunrays do not exist w=\r\nithout Sun while Sun has no meaning or purpose without sunrays (even his ex=\r\nistence may be questioned then), Shiva and Shakti are incomplete without th=\r\ne other. Just as Sun and sunrays illumine everything together, Shiva and Sh=\r\nakti manifest this entire cosmos *together*.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One may imagine Shiva as a detached person sitting in smashan an=\r\nd meditating. But that is just one aspect and one\n imagery. Detachment does=\r\n not mean disinterest or inaction.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If you look at Puranas and =\r\nTantras, so much of the knowledge was taught by Shiva to Parvati (or vice v=\r\nersa). Shiva is of course a great scholar and expert in all things you ment=\r\nioned when questioning Hanuman being Shiva tattva (&quot;an expert in all forms =\r\nof music, expert in poetry, expert in grammer/logic, expert in speech, a pu=\r\nndit of the highest order, a very multifaceted character&quot;).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Al=\r\nso, consider the imagery of Shiva being fiercely angry when his wife Sati b=\r\neing insulting and giving up her life and Shiva wreaking havoc on Daksha&#39;s =\r\nyajnashala. Does that come across as detachment to you? You quoted incident=\r\ns from Rama&#39;s life like crying for Sita to question his &quot;detachment&quot;. Thoug=\r\nh such incidents in Rama&#39;s life do go against cliched understanding of deta=\r\nchment and Shiva tattva, you have to realize that Shiva himself had similar=\r\n incidents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Sub-consciously,\n some people may associate detach=\r\nment with disinterest or aloofness or not caring or inaction. That is incor=\r\nrect. Detachment is internal. It is possible to be calm and stone-faced ext=\r\nernally, while there is deep attachment internally. It is also possible to =\r\nbehave angrily or passionately while there is no attachment in the heart. D=\r\netachment is an internal state and not a property of external signs. When y=\r\nou are looking at actions of higher beings, be more aware of this. Most imp=\r\nortantly, if one starts taking things with deep esoteric meaning at a super=\r\nficial external level, one will start having all confusions.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It is not that Shiva does not care or is disinte=\r\nrested in worldly things. After all, he is the reservoir of potential energ=\r\ny that runs the cosmos. Shakti extracts energy from him and puts it to use =\r\nby converting into kinetic\n energy.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, Shiva is disintereste=\r\nd in the sense that he absolutely does not care for what purpose the energy=\r\n is used by Shakti. Whatever it is, he unfailingly and uncomplainingly prov=\r\nides Shakti with the energy she needs.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You can look at Shakti =\r\nas an aspect of Shiva that puts *his* energy to use and you can also look S=\r\nhiva as an aspect of Shakti that stores *her* energy. They are a team that =\r\nwork together managing this field of duality and inseparable really. They c=\r\nan be viewed as one also.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As soul =\r\nis a spark of Shiva tattva and mind is a spark of shakti tattva, the same h=\r\nolds in the case of soul and mind of individual beings. Soul provides the s=\r\nupport mind needs for its various pursuits. Whatever activity one engages i=\r\nn, it is not possible without the willing support of soul. But it is happen=\r\ning because mind\n envisioned it and wanted it. Again, soul and mind are a t=\r\neam and two sides of the same coin of individual consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;All of us do have soul and mind. Rama and Krishna also had them. But my p=\r\noint was that Rama&#39;s life is a story representation of how an individual so=\r\nul operates at an esoteric level and serves its purpose. Similarly, Krishna=\r\n&#39;s life is a story representation of how a perfected mind operates at an es=\r\noterical level and serves its purpose.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;One disagreement we had was w.r.t. &quot;full&quot; avataras. Just to re-iterate=\r\n, I don&#39;t believe in &quot;full&quot; avataras as you envision. In the analogy below,=\r\n Ganga water is paramatmamsa and tap water is jivatmamsa.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Many=\r\n vessels may contain tap water with a few drops of Ganga water added (a nor=\r\nmal being). Some vessels may contain 40% tap water and 60% Ganga water (ams=\r\navatara).\n Some rare vessels may contain 100% Ganga water (poornavatara). B=\r\nut no vessel can contain &quot;Full Ganga&quot;, which can only flow outside and not =\r\nfit in any vessel! The reason you take Ganga water in a vessel is for a spe=\r\ncific purpose and you just take a vessel that suits the purpose.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Same thing holds with avataras. Ethereal beings exist in their &quot;full&quot; fo=\r\nrm ethereally. When they take a form on earth, it is what suffices the purp=\r\nose. It is like a vessel holding Ganga water.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If the vessel it=\r\nself claims &quot;don&#39;t think that I am this vessel, I am Ganga water itself&quot;, i=\r\nt is not incorrect. But it is also not correct if you understand that that =\r\nparticular vessel is the best and contains &quot;full Ganga&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now let me extend this analogy to the basic disagree=\r\nment that started this whole discussion.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;There were 9 vessels.=\r\n\n First vessel was very small (fish form). Next vessel was bigger (more evo=\r\nlved turtle form). Next vessel is bigger (boar). Next vessel was even bigge=\r\nr (half-man). Next vessel was bigger (full man, but dwarf). Next vessel was=\r\n bigger (full man, but passionate). Next vessel was bigger. Next vessel was=\r\n the same size, but had a very nice design and some praised it as &quot;Ganga wa=\r\nter itself&quot;. Next vessel was the same size, but having very plain design.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Someone (Rajarshi) came along and said, &quot;I see a clear pattern =\r\nof evolution of purity. So the last vessel does not belong. Throw it out.&quot; =\r\nHe also said that the 8th vessel was Ganga itself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Someone els=\r\ne (Narasimha) came along and said, &quot;well, vessels 3, 4, 7 and 8 are filled =\r\nwith 100% Ganga water, while vessels 5 and 6 are not. Don&#39;t conclude that a=\r\nbout purity from the outside and look inside.&quot; He also said that no vessel =\r\nwas Ganga itself, though 4 vessels contained 100% Ganga\n water.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me be absolutely clear about one thing. T=\r\nhough it may have seemed like Rajarshi was batting for Krishna and I for Ra=\r\nma, I do not have such divisions in my mind. Though Shiva &amp; Shakti or s=\r\noul &amp; mind play slightly different roles, I see them as two aspects of =\r\na single manifestation. In fact, I suggest that one cannot understand Shiva=\r\n tattva perfectly without also understanding Shakti tattva perfectly, and v=\r\nice versa. I will in fact say the same thing about Rama tattva and Krishna =\r\ntattva.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Also, I always like focusing on the boundaries of diff=\r\nerences of opinion with like-minded people, to improve collective understan=\r\nding.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I rest my case!-:)&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;Yes Rajarshi, your &quot;case&quot; is really\n tired from jumping all over t=\r\nhe place frantically and do please give it some &quot;rest&quot;! ;-)&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Se=\r\nriously though, I share my thoughts with you not because my knowledge is pe=\r\nrfect or superior, but because sharing what I see may oneday contribute tow=\r\nards perfect knowledge in *someone*. There are some really sincere seekers =\r\nof Arsha Vidya here. You are especially at the forefront of them, Rajarshi.=\r\n So I respectfully, humbly and lovingly submit my confident, but fallible, =\r\nviews.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes for Rishi Panchami again!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best=\r\n regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resource=\r\ns: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1593584224-127308093-1368583083=:58782--\r\n\n"}}
