I would hold Her Feet for Her sake and do th=\r\ne likewise for Divine Lord.\n\nWhen I was living in Brijbhoomi, it was the as=\r\nhram of disciples of Swami Shivanand =A0where I have rented a room. When I =\r\ncame back to London I kept receiving pamphlets from the Sivanand Yoga centr=\r\ne for several years.

The thought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in=\r\n this direction is rather sweet. You&#39;ve motivated me to do the mantra with =\r\neven more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with thi=\r\ns......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives=\r\n you something vaguely worthwhile like devotion.\n\nVery interesting to hear =\r\nof your experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection agai=\r\nnst dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;=\r\nm embarrassed to say that have always been scared of the dark since childho=\r\nod, slowly getting over it now. \n\nOnce at university, around 7 years ago, I=\r\n was preparing for some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back=\r\n to revise.=A0 I was moved to a room that was different to the one I had be=\r\nen staying in, as my usual room was being used for some conference guests. =\r\nI used to hang out with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chantin=\r\ng the Hare Rama mahamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om NamoN=\r\narayanaya more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. \n\nI=\r\n was lying on my back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and wa=\r\ns in some sort of light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensa=\r\ntion that can only be described as something or someone trying really hard =\r\nto strangle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake my=\r\nself up.\n\nIn this state, my mind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, =\r\nHari&quot; very very fast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was sh=\r\nort and I could say it very fast with concentration! The frightening experi=\r\nence then passed and I felt the Name saved me.\n\nI woke up and turned on the=\r\n light feeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then =\r\ndid something I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in L=\r\nondon at that time of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as=\r\n I&#39;ve stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Sw=\r\nami who initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm,=\r\n she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have be=\r\nen some real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either w=\r\nay, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repea=\r\nting the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime=\r\n to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra=\r\n before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on =\r\nbecause I&#39;m a coward ;).\n\nSince then, I keep up the practice of repeating t=\r\nhe Name before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings=\r\n positive Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)\n\nBest wishes,\n=\r\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishr=\r\nihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Hello,\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =A0 Thanks for writing this m=\r\nail and the=A0link to to the article.=A0.=A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This is a very powerfu=\r\nl and sacred mantra and I am sure regular japa=A0brings peace and protectio=\r\nn. Some years back I went to Delhi for few days and stayed at my friend&#39;s h=\r\nouse which was on fifth floor. The building was new and he told me after he=\r\n moved in with his family they had done big haven of this mantra.\n&gt; During =\r\nnight before I went to sleep I was trying to do=A0a eye open meditation and=\r\n was in a slight trance.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/entities were tryin=\r\ng to come in the room through window but they could not come as there was a=\r\n covering of white light there. I knew immediately it is the effect of that=\r\n haven in the house. Now in the link article same thing is mentioned as a p=\r\nsychic shield. Probably=A0this shield =A0was all round the=A0.building but =\r\nmore=A0so on fifth floor.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; In your previous mail you have said how y=\r\nou are doing mantra japa to complete the required number.

It is weird to see how the body loses all importanc=\r\ne the moment it dies. It is also strange how a dead body looks just like an=\r\n empty house...exactly like someone just left. It certainly makes one think=\r\n that there must be something more to us than this fleshy cage. This cage t=\r\nhat becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appalling miseries in seri=\r\nous illness, and hideous in death. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesting to think about w=\r\nhat one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyond a=\r\nll human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utterly=\r\n helpless to relieve suffering. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sivananda used to have great faith in=\r\n the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While modern medicine, Ay=\r\nurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to say that, Namapathy was =\r\nan outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on all levels- physical, =\r\nmental and spiritual. \n&gt; \n&gt; While he said all names of God- Rama, Allah, Bu=\r\nddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra spe=\r\ncially for healing purposes. And especially for those who are very sick or =\r\ndying.\n&gt; \n&gt; He says &quot;MahaMrityunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurabl=\r\ne diseases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I visited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nad=\r\nu some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day =\r\nwith chanting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients=\r\n, each other and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the little =\r\nAshram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start the day.....rep=\r\neating mantras with your colleagues. \n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to mention the power of=\r\n this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or ind=\r\need, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the =\r\nblessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basica=\r\nlly saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course it i=\r\ns NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God)=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; At any point in time, there are several human beings, animals and v=\r\narious creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during =\r\nthe process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few =\r\ntimes daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe t=\r\nhem. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a link for those who are interested in learning more abo=\r\nut this great mantra. The article is written by a disciple of Swami Satyana=\r\nnda, a saint of very recent times. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.yogamag.net/archives/20=\r\n07/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om ShaantihShaantihSh=\r\naantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!

The thought of Vi=\r\nshnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in this direction is =\r\nrather sweet. You&#39;ve motivated me to do the mantra with even more enthusias=\r\nm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with this......Ramakrishna =\r\nsays you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you something vagu=\r\nely worthwhile like devotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very interesting to hear of your exper=\r\nience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection against dodgy sit=\r\nuations. I don&#39;t like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed=\r\n to say that have always been scared of the dark since childhood, slowly ge=\r\ntting over it now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was pr=\r\neparing for some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to rev=\r\nise.&nbsp; I was moved to a room that was different to the one I had been s=\r\ntaying in, as my usual room\n was being used for some conference guests. I u=\r\nsed to hang out with the Hare &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-14&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Krish=\r\nnas&lt;/span&gt; then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama &lt;span id=3D&quot;mis=\r\nspell-15&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;mahamantra&lt;/span&gt; then (still love this mantra, bu=\r\nt chant Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-16&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nmisspell-17&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narayanaya&lt;/span&gt; more now)- used to do 2 hours=\r\n a day and it made me feel good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was lying on my back in this new=\r\n room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of light sleep sta=\r\nte. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can only be described a=\r\ns something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I felt very frigh=\r\ntened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this state, my=\r\n mind started repeating &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-18&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-19&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspel=\r\nl-20&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span\n id=3D&quot;misspell-21&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;H=\r\nari&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-22&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/span&gt;&quot; very very =\r\nfast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could =\r\nsay it very fast with concentration! The frightening experience then passed=\r\n and I felt the Name saved me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I woke up and turned on the light fee=\r\nling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did someth=\r\ning I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-23&quot; class=3D&quot;ma=\r\nrk&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; Yoga centre in London at that time of night (I knew th=\r\ney don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve stayed there) and had the nerve =\r\nto ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated me into my chosen ma=\r\nntra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the phone and=\r\n reassured me saying it could have been some real negative force or just so=\r\nmething from my imagination. Either way, she reassured me saying I had done=\r\n nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating\n the Name was the right approach.=\r\n She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar experiences. I then=\r\n chanted some rounds of the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-24&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahaman=\r\ntra&lt;/span&gt; before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light =\r\nthough on because I&#39;m a coward ;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then, I keep up the &lt;span i=\r\nd=3D&quot;misspell-25&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;practice&lt;/span&gt; of repeating the Name befo=\r\nre bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Di=\r\nvine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-26&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Laxmi =\r\nNarayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for writing this mail and the&nbsp=\r\n;link to to the article.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; This is a very=\r\n powerful and sacred mantra and I am sure regular &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-29&quot; =\r\nclass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japa&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;brings peace and protection. Some years bac=\r\nk I went to Delhi for few days and stayed at my friend&#39;s house which was on=\r\n fifth floor. The building was new and he told me after he moved in with hi=\r\ns family they had done big haven of this mantra.&lt;br&gt;&gt; During night befor=\r\ne I went to sleep I was trying to do&nbsp;a eye open meditation and was in =\r\na slight trance.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/entities were trying to com=\r\ne in the room through window but they could not come as there was a coverin=\r\ng of white light there. I knew immediately it is the effect of that haven i=\r\nn the house. Now in the link article same thing is mentioned as\n a psychic =\r\nshield.

It is wei=\r\nrd to see how the body loses all importance the moment it dies. It is also =\r\nstrange how a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactly like someo=\r\nne just left. It certainly makes one\n think that there must be something mo=\r\nre to us than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old =\r\nage, filled with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous in deat=\r\nh. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; It is interesting to think about what one can do to he=\r\nlp the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It is =\r\nnot pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utterly helpless to relieve=\r\n suffering. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-38&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sivan=\r\nanda&lt;/span&gt; used to have great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divin=\r\ne &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-39&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namapathy&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. While modern m=\r\nedicine, Ayurveda, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-40&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Reiki&lt;/span&gt; etc=\r\n all have their place, he used to say that, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-41&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namapathy&lt;/span&gt; was an outstanding way to prevent disease and he=\r\nal us on all levels- physical, mental and spiritual. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Whil=\r\ne he said all names of God- Rama, Allah,\n Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he of=\r\nten mentioned the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-42&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially for those who a=\r\nre very sick or dying.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; He says &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-43&quot; c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Maha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-44&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mrityunja=\r\nya&lt;/span&gt; Mantra will remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long =\r\nlife and immortality. It is a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-45&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Moksh=\r\na&lt;/span&gt; Mantra too.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I visited the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-4=\r\n6&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; Charitable hospital in &lt;span id=3D&quot;missp=\r\nell-47&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Pattamadai&lt;/span&gt;, Tamil &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-48&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Nadu&lt;/span&gt; some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who wor=\r\nk there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including the &lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nmisspell-49&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt;) for their patients, eac=\r\nh other and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the\n little Ashr=\r\nam hospital in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-50&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Rishikesh&lt;/span&gt;. Wh=\r\nat a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleag=\r\nues. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for any=\r\none who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself=\r\n are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God to e=\r\nase suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will=\r\n be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for a m=\r\niracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God). &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nAt any point in time, there are several human beings, animals and various c=\r\nreatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during the proc=\r\ness of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few times da=\r\nily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Here is a link for those who are interested\n in learning mor=\r\ne about this great mantra. The article is written by a disciple of Swami &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;misspell-51&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Satyananda&lt;/span&gt;, a saint of very re=\r\ncent times. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/20=\r\n07/ajan07/mrit.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/200=\r\n7/ajan07/mrit.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;spa=\r\nn id=3D&quot;misspell-52&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; || Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspel=\r\nl-53&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Shaantih&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-54&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;Shaantih&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-55&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Shaantih&lt;/span&gt; |=\r\n|&lt;br&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
