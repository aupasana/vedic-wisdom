These are the statistics below f=\r\nor eye donations done successfully yearly in India.\n\nI am quoting directly =\r\nfrom Indian express.\n\nhttp://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-lot-needs-to-be-d=\r\none-to-create-awareness-on-eye-donation/551681/0\n\n1. 1/3rd of the world&#39;s b=\r\nlind population is in India and most of them go blind due to preventable ca=\r\ntaract formation and other issues.\n\n2.Sankara Netrayala as mentioned in the=\r\n article is an acclaimed organization which on a average conducts on a aver=\r\nage 1000 eye transplantation surgeries.\n\n1000!!!! lives impacted with one o=\r\nrganization...is that an small number. Still millions wait for an surgery t=\r\no gain eyesight. \n\n\nBy the way ..Sankara Netrayala is associated with the K=\r\nanchi peetham and was inspired by the clarion call of Sri Jayendra Saraswat=\r\nhi in the 1970&#39;s. Also the Kanchi peetham has an annex centre associated wi=\r\nth Sankara Netralaya. \n\nKanchi peetham also works with the Sankara eye foun=\r\ndation\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankara_Nethralaya\n\nhttp://www.sankara=\r\nnethralaya.org/patient-care-jkcn.html\n\nNobody is advocating not following t=\r\nhe samskaras after death.What is preventing the following of the samskara f=\r\nor rest of the corpse.\n\nWhich is an greater punya , using an part of the bo=\r\ndy after the soul has left to bring alive the life of another person or bli=\r\nndly sticking to dogma.\n\nRegards\nVemparla RamKishore\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Hemanth Kumar G &lt;vijnasu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I wrote, Indradi d=\r\nevatas would be summoned on Brahma Hatyaif they had killed Dadichi and take=\r\nn away the bones. Your point of discussion about Ashwini Kumaras and Haya S=\r\nhira stories is prior to this incident.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Basic rule of Medical scien=\r\nce says that one body cannot accept the parts of another one. There are lot=\r\n of medical practitioners who had understood & experienced this fact. Even =\r\nthough you operate and stitch a Kidney or heart, the body will always be re=\r\nsisting to the external organ. Donated blood will be rejected in terms of U=\r\nrine, swet and other excretions within some days. Lot of foreign civilizati=\r\nons knew this fact and they never take other body remains. So you can see i=\r\nn http://www.noblood.org/medical-conditions-treatments/6478-open-heart-surg=\r\nery-without-blood-can-done-routinely\n&gt; \n&gt; Every day this modern science giv=\r\nes new statements. First they say that external blood supply is mandatory i=\r\nn case of blood loss. Then they only warn about the un healthy, contaminati=\r\non, uselessness of stored blood after some hours etc., Science doesn&#39;t beli=\r\neves in Paapa, Punya. Then why they used the concept of &quot;Daana&quot; in the name=\r\n of blood donation and advertised it as a work that gives Punya! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nnly in certain processes like in reproduction, there will be mixture of 2 d=\r\nifferent materials, but body nourishes it as a separate wing and reproduces=\r\n offspring. Eye donation is another corruption. Cornea which is the outer l=\r\nens of the Eye can only be made fit to a person having Cornea damage. That =\r\ntoo the sizes should match. Its not true that all the eyes which has been d=\r\nonated has been used and a blind got the sight. There are very rare cases w=\r\nho get blindness due to Cornea damage. Just make a trip around Blind school=\r\ns & eye banks to understand the actual statistics of blind getting vision!!=\r\n Cornea transplantation is just like fixing eye lens that we use nowadays. =\r\nBut in the future there may be syntho-organic material that replaces human =\r\ndonated cornea. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Remember that any of your organ is not useful if i=\r\nt is given to others. Either it will be thrown out after some time by stori=\r\nng banks or its rejected by body after some time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Its foreign missi=\r\nonaries who familiarized this kind of transfusions.=A0 Their science is jus=\r\nt a baby stepping now. But our seers had much better vision behind every wo=\r\nrd & inventions.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Animals also die, decay & perish. Its soul goes ac=\r\ncording to its karma. But we are men, not pashu. My suggestion is for the p=\r\neople who believe and practice Sanatana Bhatiya Dharma and its rituals. Why=\r\n body is made into ashes including a detailed proceducre of Shava Samskara =\r\nwith medicinal plants, fire and mantras? Why uttara shodasha karma is done =\r\nsuch that the worldly desires of atma is seperated, soul is given a divya s=\r\nharira, sent to pitru lokha and only the daivika part of atma is kept for t=\r\nhe welfare of the family and worshipped every yver in terms of Shradda Prak=\r\nriya? In each and every part of these rituals there will be a separation of=\r\n bodily elements and -ve energies attached to soul such that it shouldn&#39;t c=\r\nontact the living humans or other creatures. Till what level we do this? We=\r\n wont leave ash also. It will be made floated it some of Punya Teertas like=\r\n Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari etc., There is in depth Genetic level explanation =\r\nhidden in all\n&gt;  these practices.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
