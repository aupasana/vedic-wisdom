Hinsa (Injury/Killing)\ninvolved in that is quite different than say =\r\nfor instance, Injury and\nkilling involved in Military Wars.\nIf a Tiger is a=\r\nttacking human societies every now and then and killing\npeople then it is r=\r\nequired to be captured or Killed. That Hinsa is\ndifferent.\nSo now if we tal=\r\nk about Swa-Dharma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or\nCollective society D=\r\nharma or Rashtra Dharma, The Killing which happens\nduring Military war can =\r\nfall in Swa-Dharma of a soldier who kills\nsolders of the other side. It can=\r\n be called Dharma of Group of people\n(Society) to kill a Man eater Tiger.\n\n=\r\nWhat i am referring to again and again is the Killing involved for the\nreas=\r\non of Food habits and THAT is what which can not fall under\nSwa-Dharma of p=\r\neople eating meat.

Vegetarian\npeople also have cravings f=\r\nor Spicy, Hot, Sweet, etc.. food.

P=\r\nlease take\nthem in the right vein. I am merely discussing.

However , I&#39;ll honestly\nsay that i have no answers for &#39;l=\r\nife in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I used to eat non-vegetarian food man=\r\ny of my friends who\nwere=C3=83=E2=80=9A vegetarian people would give me a s=\r\nimilar logic, as you\nmentioned in your first writing. My point is, as a non=\r\n-vegetarian I am\nnot claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants=\r\n, over\nanimals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=83=E2=80=9A this logic that=\r\n many\nvegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit\n=\r\neating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I perso=\r\nnally can not look at butchery shops where one finds\nhanging goats. its pat=\r\nhetic site. People in their excitements stand in\nqueue to see the cutting o=\r\nf throat of a chicken and then take away that\nas parcel. The flash of so cr=\r\nuelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow\nor pig, is so tasty for the huma=\r\nns that they just overlook the voice of\ntheir inner self. a fish which come=\r\ns out of water is such a disturbing\nsite. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have p=\r\nroper English word to describe\nthe condition of a fish out of water). and t=\r\nhen the dead fish thus is so\ntasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personall=\r\ny do\nnot share them. Call me cruel hearted.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n When the question of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal\nstandard =\r\nfor such. It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels\ndisgusted or =\r\npained about may not affect another. Same rule cannot be\nused to judge ever=\r\nyone.=C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetar=\r\nian friends were watching discovery\nchannel where they showed that people i=\r\nn some parts of the world eat\ninsects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked=\r\n them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can\neat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A if someone eats an\ninsect. Just because one is born in a certain are=\r\na in a certain culture\nin a certain set of value, one gets the believe that=\r\n what one is not\naccustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a futur=\r\ne life time\nthey were to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eati=\r\nng\ninsects without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are\nincorri=\r\ngible product of our own conditions which in my opinion is all\nright. BUT t=\r\nhe problem happens when we think our conditions are the only\npossible condi=\r\ntioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t\nothers share simila=\r\nr ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the\nworld diverse, and so it=\r\n is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who\nis\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian =\r\nin this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/\nfamily in a later lifetim=\r\ne which=C3=83=E2=80=9A eats non-vegetarian food, he\nwould not even bat an e=\r\nye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=83=E2=80=9A\npeople who faint at the=\r\n sight of blood, but there are doctors who do\nmultiple operations daily. So=\r\n my point is, personal sensitivity can be a\nvery good reason for an individ=\r\nual, but it=C3=83=E2=80=9A cannot\nbe=C3=83=E2=80=9A a universal logic appli=\r\ncable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tacklin=\r\ng this is the idea of karma. Even\nthen, if someone can make sure he is not =\r\ndirectly killing an animal, not\nselecting a live animal to be killed, but r=\r\nather buys dead\nmeat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. F=\r\nurther, if\nsomeone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=E2=80=9A does not want to deal =\r\nin the raw\nflesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of=\r\n karma\nthat you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily\nh=\r\nandled.=C3=83=E2=80=9A It is similar to the one you would get for buying\nso=\r\nme simple daal which has come to the market through the hands of a\nmiddle m=\r\nan who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is\nkarmic repu=\r\nrcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable.\nThere are some=\r\n eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They\nare designed to be=\r\n eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot\nlike dead from birth.=\r\n What karma does one get for consuming that?

So too is vio=\r\nlence in service &gt;of Dharma.)&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;This I find very acceptab=\r\nle. Now if the question arises what is &gt;Dharma, I would request going ba=\r\nck to the mails of Narasmiha on &gt;Dharma, because no one has &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;Let me clea=\r\nr few things explicitly. We are confusing and Mixing different things here.=\r\n I am taking &#39;Ahimsa&#39; in the context of Food habits/preferences and Hinsa i=\r\nnvolved in that. Hinsa (Injury/Killing) involved in that is quite different=\r\n than say for instance, Injury and killing involved in Military Wars.&lt;BR&gt;If=\r\n a Tiger is attacking human societies every now and then and killing people=\r\n then it is required to be captured or Killed. That Hinsa is different.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSo now if we talk about Swa-Dharma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or Coll=\r\nective society Dharma or Rashtra Dharma, The Killing which happens during M=\r\nilitary war can fall in Swa-Dharma of a soldier who kills solders of the ot=\r\nher side. It can be called Dharma of Group of people (Society) to kill a Ma=\r\nn eater Tiger.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;What i am referring to again and again is the Killing involv=\r\ned for the reason of Food habits and THAT is what which can not fall under =\r\nSwa-Dharma of people eating meat. Its possible that the karma of people wor=\r\nking in Butchery shops may not be that heavier then the people who eat meat=\r\n.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;=\r\n&quot;&gt;In my opinion, references to Swadharma is not proper here.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;=\r\n/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;***&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SP=\r\nAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;It is also=\r\n correct that Most have cravings for the palate. Vegetarian people also hav=\r\ne cravings for Spicy, Hot, Sweet, etc.. food. The Major difference however =\r\nis that Craving for the Veg food is far better in comparison because cravin=\r\ng for a Chicken or Mutton amounts directly to a loss of life.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;=\r\n&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;Again, I thin=\r\nk that it is not required to go in to philosophical discussions here.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o=\r\n&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;***&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;I understand that people are born with the Karma baggage of past lives. t=\r\nhey will get the culture, family background, habits etc... due to that. Men=\r\ntal conditioning will vary. BUT if a person comes to know about certain thi=\r\nngs then it is no use blaming or taking shelter under the circumstances. Hi=\r\ns/her will is always there. Discrimination is always there. I dare give an =\r\nadvise here. if somebody wants to change Habits which one feel to be disast=\r\nrous, one can try as much possible &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Geor=\r\ngia;&quot;&gt;(Like Rajarshi tried for 108 days)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; and at the same ti=\r\nme surrender to God. pray every day to almighty to help and over a period o=\r\nf time, help will come. will surely come.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;&quot;&gt;I do not boast or take any pride=\r\n in eating Vegetarian food and&nbsp;my intentions are never to insult the p=\r\neople who eat meat.

Dharma (Non Violence)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; agains=\r\nt Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally vege=\r\ntarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, or el=\r\nse it conflicts with your system badly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, Sa=\r\nadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. k=\r\nilling for filling stomach is if Not right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not ri=\r\nght in all conditions*. it is a different matter, if in future i succumb to=\r\n challanging conditions and start eating meat but even then it&#39;ll not justi=\r\nfy and make it proper thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear R=\r\najarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get offended by my message. i apologise in ad=\r\nvance for my bluntness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; your second Para and some writing=\r\ns in your earlier message gives me impression that you are heavily philosop=\r\nhising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chi=\r\ncken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. with that logic, those =\r\npeople who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly al=\r\nright. even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable =\r\nand not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality=\r\n judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already de=\r\nad&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they=\r\n hate killing invloved.

If so much of kill=\r\ning every hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in=\r\n the world, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have =\r\na peacefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma =\r\n(Cause &amp; effect) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human socie=\r\nties.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Om Shaanti Shaanti Shaanti:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Warm =\r\nRegards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; I hope you or others won&#39;t get offended by my mails.

My point is, as a non-veg=\r\netarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants, ov=\r\ner animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=83=E2=80=9A this logic that man=\r\ny vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eati=\r\nng non-veg, does not hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally can not look at butchery shops where one f=\r\ninds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in=\r\n queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take away that as=\r\n parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pi=\r\ng, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice of their in=\r\nner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing site. Pantin=\r\ng for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe the condition of =\r\na fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally =\r\ndo not share them. Call me cruel hearted. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the question of sensitivity comes in, t=\r\nhere is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning=\r\n. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect another. Same rul=\r\ne cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends w=\r\nere watching discovery channel where they showed that people in some parts =\r\nof the world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;=\r\n. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A if someo=\r\nne eats an insect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain =\r\nculture in a certain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is no=\r\nt accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time the=\r\ny were to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects with=\r\nout the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product o=\r\nf our own conditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happ=\r\nens when we think our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the =\r\nworld, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That i=\r\ns incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is. Everything=\r\n is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; veget=\r\narian in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/ family in a later l=\r\nifetime which=C3=83=E2=80=9A eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even ba=\r\nt an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=83=E2=80=9A people who faint =\r\nat the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations dai=\r\nly. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an i=\r\nndividual, but it=C3=83=E2=80=9A cannot be=C3=83=E2=80=9A a universal logic=\r\n applicable to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then=\r\n, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing an animal, not select=\r\ning a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the kar=\r\nma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some coo=\r\nked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would get for it is q=\r\nuite acceptble IMO.
