Please point out my mis=\r\ntakes I will make in this process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are trying to discuss three =\r\npoints here\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human=\r\n population on Non-veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of=\r\n Non veg vs Veg food.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I commented on two points \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choos=\r\ning a dietary habit \n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sourc=\r\nes of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One should ch=\r\noose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal =\r\nin his life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or research s=\r\nays. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for a per=\r\nson seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he is a=\r\nble to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha =\r\nJi about this point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In some diseases Non veg sources play an very=\r\n important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two=\r\n eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Inject=\r\nions. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it =\r\nstrongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on=\r\n non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree with the link provided in th=\r\nis discussions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing =\r\nfor switching to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book ref=\r\nerence which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every i=\r\nnformation on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like ast=\r\nrology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply =\r\nfactor. In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about =\r\n45% people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied=\r\n by Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legume=\r\ns (including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), =\r\nNuts (include almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (=\r\nMilk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very comple=\r\nte source), \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but t=\r\nheir price rose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can no=\r\nt afford a complete balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 2=\r\n50 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruit=\r\ns per person, along with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum =\r\nquantities. Different sources may quote different quantities). There is ave=\r\nrage family size of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutr=\r\nition is not the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures=\r\n are there\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even at current prices, 60% population can not afford b=\r\nalanced diet. If additional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price=\r\n may rise another 100% and I need not to explain what will happen at that t=\r\nime.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sir, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a stric=\r\nt vegetarian, even for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum crueli=\r\nty (Yes you can not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from mar=\r\nket and do not produce it yourself)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, I think and believe tha=\r\nt practically it is impossible to shift all the population to veg sources e=\r\nspecially when the agriculture land is decreasing day by day because of man=\r\ny reasons)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different sources\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIt is always a questionable point. because again sections supporting vegeta=\r\nrian diet will highlight the results which support veg food and vice versa.=\r\n There are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we w=\r\nill find that for different sources different sources are better. For examp=\r\nle calcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is bes=\r\nt, for Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ay=\r\nurveda also support this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non ve=\r\ng will suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food al=\r\none. As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does t=\r\nhe deep fried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit it will not=\r\n let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy i=\r\ns used in digesting food, less energy is available for brain. it is a sciet=\r\nific fact that after food, significant blood supply is directed to intestin=\r\nes. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing=\r\n in us? We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want t=\r\no become.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But still at last, I want to mention that I am not advoc=\r\nating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetar=\r\nian too. We should understand that we may be right but we should realise th=\r\nat it does not necessarily mean other person is not right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please =\r\npoint out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i m=\r\nentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approxi=\r\nmate and not too much off the line.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree with two p=\r\noints you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sci=\r\nence part of these discussions, as I had already maintained right at the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; beginning).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a s=\r\ncientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back.

Gorillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted=\r\n more energy towards the development of brain. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were not =\r\nsure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectua=\r\nl development.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as hu=\r\nman nutrition=C3=82=C2=A0is concerned, because human \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stomach structu=\r\nre (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fa=\r\nr easier to digest than most planet based products. In my other mail, I hav=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutri=\r\ntion and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0take a few days since I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to get them from people who de=\r\nal with these topics professionally, but time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not a problem.=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from the most accepted and reputed \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I=\r\n said, it is myth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that=C3=82=C2=A0vegeterian=C3=82=C2=A0foods are=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in my experience, I never found traditional veg=\r\neterians to be any more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals ha=\r\nve their own vaasanas and their needs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on v=\r\negetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/sh=\r\ne needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain the same. But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if trained they =\r\ncan &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegete=\r\nrian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the =\r\nsake of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; survival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to=\r\n disease and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and wea=\r\nkness that may result \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up be=\r\ning diseased, but the chances \n&gt; &gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smo=\r\nkers die of cancer, but smoking makes one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It =\r\nincreases the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion is that an =\r\nanimal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt; way poss=\r\nible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\ncientists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that =\r\nmeat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since =\r\nat least 4 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous,=\r\n the structure of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\ncaecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold increase in=C3=82=C2=A0brain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nize (from archeological evidences)=C3=82=C2=A0could never have been what it=\r\n is today. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82=C2=A0nat=\r\nural process, so ingrained that it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has changed the very structure of=\r\n the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; &gt; &gt; consciously, but only by the wo=\r\nrk of natural forces.

A few quick comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) We are we we eat.=\r\n Production of various chemicals in our body and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interactions,=\r\n are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound \n&gt; &gt; &gt; imp=\r\nact on us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material benefits =\r\nfrom vegetarianism. But that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and sub=\r\ntle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an anim=\r\nal that strongly identifies with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. =\r\nSelf-identification of plants with their physical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body is much subtl=\r\ner and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smalle=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat=\r\n production by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Pa=\r\nrt of the karma for their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from=\r\n their meat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR =\r\n(National Public Radio) several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an exper=\r\niment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other =\r\nset was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers=\r\n found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fed with =\r\nmeat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat take=\r\ns up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverte=\r\nd more energy towards the development of brain. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were not=\r\n sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced v=\r\negetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot =\r\nfocus well \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is becaus=\r\ne the digestive process \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as a=\r\ngni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; agni available for other activitie=\r\ns such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happens in the mind. =\r\nSimilarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; requires ag=\r\nni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana befo=\r\nre \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestiv=\r\ne agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods that =\r\nstimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequently, agni is =\r\ndiverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni \n&gt; &gt; &gt; availab=\r\nle for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, sim=\r\nple \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spice=\r\ns, and fruits), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agn=\r\ni is available for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and=\r\n experiences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. =\r\nBut huge stacks of dry grass may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similar=\r\nly, little bit of internal fire may be enough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritua=\r\nl ideas and experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vaasanas and few =\r\nobstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a =\r\nperson with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on diges=\r\nting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person =\r\nmay eat saattwik \n&gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual tra=\r\nnsformation and yet struggle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the b=\r\nest course of action for one is to ignore \n&gt; &gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a =\r\nvegetarian. All other things being equal, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maximizes the agni av=\r\nailable for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question=\r\n: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an animal can =\r\nsurvive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow wh=\r\natever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live t=\r\no eat. A yogi should consume enough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so that =\r\none can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world using physical bod=\r\ny and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not good for =\r\nspiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and =\r\nfasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; better to eat limited amount always.=\r\n Regular practices are more important for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and success=\r\n, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that god i=\r\ns the doer of all actions or considering food \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, on=\r\ne cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply ingrain=\r\ned that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fe=\r\nels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a diffe=\r\nrence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
