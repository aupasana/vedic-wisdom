You are correct that &quot;we are no longer \ntalking about physic=\r\nal energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental \nenergy - the ment=\r\nal equivalent of sound in the mind&quot;.\n\nMind is the connection between what y=\r\nou called external universe and what \nyou called the deeper non-material un=\r\niverse. Mind has access to ALL realms \nof experience, but it normally focus=\r\nes on the physical/material realm. \nThough mind can theretically be focused=\r\n on ANY realm of experience through \neffort, it is not easy.\n\nLet me give a=\r\n small analogy.\n\nIf Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic being (wh=\r\no thinks all that \nall of us think, who desires all that all of us desire, =\r\nwho knows all that \nall of us know, and who does all that all of us do) is =\r\nlike the bottommost \nlayer of ocean. Various deities are like intermediate =\r\nlayers. Various \nobjects of the external material world that are perceived =\r\nby our senses are \nlike the ripples on the surface of the ocean. Objects on=\r\n the surface \nperceive other objects on the surface around them. One&#39;s body=\r\n and the senses \nattached to it are an object on the surface in the analogy=\r\n. When one&#39;s mind \nidentifies &quot;self&quot; with that body and its senses, it perc=\r\neives objects as \nperceived by those senses. When one successfully detaches=\r\n mind from that \nself-identity and identifies with another object in the oc=\r\nean in a different \nlayer, one may perceive a different reality. An example=\r\n was in yesterday&#39;s \nmail on mystical experiences.\n\nJust as the ocean is va=\r\nst and deep and has infinite objects at infinite \ndepths, this universe has=\r\n infinite possible self-identities. As one&#39;s \nself-awareness is focused on =\r\na specific object, one has specific \nexperience/percepti on of self and &quot;ot=\r\nhers&quot;. When self-awareness changes to a \ndifferent object, one has a differ=\r\nent experience/percepti on of self and \n&quot;others&quot;. However, this is theoreti=\r\ncal discussion for most people, as they \ncannot imagine self-awareness chan=\r\nging. The self-awareness of most people is \nfocused on their body with its =\r\nsenses and their experience/percepti on of \nself is the body and &quot;others&quot; i=\r\ns various objects as perceived through the \nsenses attached to that body. B=\r\nut, it IS possible for one&#39;s self-awareness \nto go from an object on the oc=\r\nean surface in the analogy to a layer in the \nmdidle of the ocean or even a=\r\n bottommost layer.\n\nRepetition of a mantra is only a tool for calming down =\r\nthe mental activity \nthat keeps feeding this self-awareness. Mind is identi=\r\nfying with a physical \nobject made with gross matter (body). By keeping it =\r\nbusy with a particular \nrepetitive activity, you have a chance of cutting o=\r\nff its identification \nwith that object. As an analogy, suppose a kid saw a=\r\n rope right next to him \nand thought it was a snake and was scared. You may=\r\n tell him no, but still \nthe thought &quot;snake is next to me&quot; will keep scarin=\r\ng him. If you keep him \nbusy with an activity that he immerses in, the thou=\r\nght of snake next to him \nmay vanish from his mind slowly.\n\nOnce the identi=\r\nfication of mind with the body is cut off or weakened, mind \nwill have to i=\r\ndentify with something else. Imagine a frog clinging to a rock \non an ocean=\r\n surface. If it is afraid of slipping and holds on the rock \ntightly, its t=\r\nhoughts are on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking \nabout rock and =\r\nbecomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the \nrock. If it =\r\nstarts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of something else \non the way=\r\n to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will drop all the way to the \nocean bed. T=\r\nhough that is not a bad thing at all, the frog is afraid of it \nand instinc=\r\ntively grabs something on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind \nwill get =\r\na hold of another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) \nand devel=\r\nop another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. \nIn the e=\r\nxample from last night, the perception of &quot;I&quot; was not the body, but \na tiny=\r\n particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberated with the \nsound =\r\nof a beejaakshara. The perception of &quot;others&quot; was millions of \nparticles of=\r\n the same wave of energy engaged in making the same sound and \naborbed in t=\r\nhe same sound.\n\nLet me come back to what you wrote: &quot;if mantra is to have A=\r\nNY enlightening \neffect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself. ... We ar=\r\ne no longer \ntalking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-m=\r\naterial mental \nenergy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.&quot;\n\nMind=\r\n or individualized consciousness is just a window to the universe. If a \nro=\r\nom has window on the east, you see what is on the east. If a room has \nwind=\r\now on the west, you see what is on the west. And so on. The sound of the \nm=\r\nantra IS resonating somewhere (actually, everywhere) in the universe. A \nmi=\r\nnd with a strong self-identification with a body is bombarded by the sense =\r\n\ninputs of that body, just as a room with an open window on the south is \nf=\r\nilled with cold wind blowing from the south and bombarded by the \nfloodligh=\r\nts installed outside on the south. You have to close that window \nand open =\r\nwindow elsewhere to get something else. If self-identification with \nbody i=\r\ns weakened, the bombardment of sense inputs weakens and the window of \nmind=\r\n can open to the mantra that resonates in the universe.\n\nWhen I said earlie=\r\nr that a vaccum should be created in the mind for the \nmantra and the deity=\r\n to fill, this is what I was referring to.\n\n* * *\n\nDifferent objects of the=\r\n universe, including human beings and deities, are \nmade up of gross/subtle=\r\n matters of different gunas. Each object of the \nuniverse has different per=\r\nceptions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. Each object of the \nuniverse has different en=\r\nergies, i.e. different abilities to affect \ninteractions between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;o=\r\nthers&quot;.\n\nThe energy of an object is the energy that brought that object int=\r\no being. \nDeities are objects with tremendous energy. But one cannot get cl=\r\nose to a \ndeity unless one overcomes attachment to individualized ego and i=\r\nts \npotential energy. One needs to convert that potential energy into kinet=\r\nic \nenergy that helps one break away from that ego and approach a deity.\n\nI=\r\nn the long run, none of those objects is permanent. None of those energies =\r\n\nis permanent. In terms of the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to =\r\nan \nobject on the way to the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is t=\r\no not \nview any object as &quot;I&quot; and not consider any energy as &quot;mine&quot;. The fi=\r\nnal goal \nis to drop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, with=\r\nout any \nsense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;.\n\n* * *\n\nPlease realize two =\r\nfundamental things:\n\n(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced *after* th=\r\ne sadhana is fruitful \nand one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indirect too=\r\nl for overcoming ego. If \none thinks that he is doing a powerful mantra and=\r\n its energy will free him \nfrom ego, one is mistakened. One MUST put in con=\r\nscious effort with constant \ncontemplation to weed out ego and pride to mak=\r\ne one&#39;s sadhana fruitful. \nMantra does not replace that need. Instead, it w=\r\norks hands in hand with that \nand depends on that.\n\n(2) When one succeeds i=\r\nn overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one \nshould not think that &quot;I d=\r\nid it&quot; or &quot;I created that energy in my mind&quot;. One \ndoes not do anything (ot=\r\nher than *undoing* what one did previously, viz \nputting together of a comp=\r\nlex and weird self-identity called a body with so \nmany things attached to =\r\nit and so many pre-conceived notions about the \nworld). The energy of the m=\r\nantra IS already there and resonating everywhere. \nWhen mind experiences th=\r\nat energy and fills with it, it is simply *tuning* \nto something pre-existi=\r\nng and not really creating something or doing \nsomething. It is like a radi=\r\no tuning to a different channel and one \nlistening to newer and better musi=\r\nc or a driver driving on a different \nscenic road and viewing beautiful and=\r\n better scenery.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; If all repetitive chanting were equal, mantra sh=\r\nastra would be\n&gt; 1/2 a page of text, not more.\n\nI never said they were equa=\r\nl. Perfect absorption into different mantras \nfills the mind with different=\r\n kinds of enegies (associated with different \ndeities). So there is a lot o=\r\nf difference to chronicle. In terms of my ocean \nanalogy, the possible expe=\r\nriences when one is absorbed into a mantra are as \nvast as an ocean.\n\nBut, =\r\nthe essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlty absorbed into the mantra \nan=\r\nd a vacuum has to be created in the mind for the mantra and its deity to \nf=\r\nill. Other factors related to the specific details in each mantra are \nseco=\r\nndary. I want to de-emphasize all other things and emphasize this \nessentia=\r\nl thing, i.e. control over ego.\n\nOne wanting to drive a car on various road=\r\ns needs a detailed book giving all \nthe maps. But my point is that one shou=\r\nld first learn driving. What makes \none an expert driver going to various p=\r\nlaces is not possession of thousand \nmaps but the basic driving skill. One =\r\nnot knowing driving will crash the car \neven if he possesses thousand maps.=\r\n One good at driving may manage without \nmaps too. People emphasize complic=\r\nated, mystified and nuanced knowledge and \nforget the basic essence.\n\n* * *=\r\n\n\nI want to categorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are neit=\r\nher \nnecessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress. One ma=\r\ny \nspend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anything.\n\nIf the=\r\n basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despite not \nknowing t=\r\nhe nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally to one who gets \nsome m=\r\nastery over the essential factors.\n\nThe proof of the pudding is in eating i=\r\nt. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara \nand meditate on it silently everyday,=\r\n for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit \ncomfortably with the back, neck and h=\r\nead erect, eyes closed and mind as calm \nas possible. Avoid all physical mo=\r\nvement and remain as still as you can. If \nyou have an urge to move, suppre=\r\nss it as long as you can and keep pushing \nthe limit everyday. Try your bes=\r\nt to focus the mind on mantra. Do this \nmeditation sitting in the same plac=\r\ne, facing the same direction and at \naround the same time everyday. Do this=\r\n for one year and see for yourself if \nit does something to you or not, des=\r\npite not paying attention to the \ntechnicalities and nuances!\n\n* * *\n\nSome =\r\nnuances are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most \npeo=\r\nple. For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti and keelaka of \n=\r\nthe mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa. Those are all \nrele=\r\nvant only to a person of a high level of self-awareness, which is not \nthe =\r\ncase with most people.\n\nLet me give an analogy. There may be some nuances r=\r\nelated to how to lift the \nfoot up and land the foot while running, to maxi=\r\nmize the speed. They are \nirrelevant to a small baby who cannot yet walk an=\r\nd only crawls. When the \nbaby learns how to walk and later how to run, thos=\r\ne details will most likely \ncome to him naturally. Evem without them, one w=\r\nill run fine, perhaps a \nlittle\nslower. Thus, there is no point in trying t=\r\no learn the nuances of running \nwhen one is still crawling. In fact, unneed=\r\ned focus on those nuances of \nrunning may even make one&#39;s learning of walki=\r\nng very slow - it is a \ndistraction!\n\n* * *\n\nI answered whatever questions =\r\nI could answer and felt like answering.\n\nWhat we need today is not people w=\r\nho can discuss theory in detail and have \nan intellectual understanding of =\r\nthings. In fact, these things are beyond \nintellectual comprehension. Pract=\r\nical sadhana is far more important. Do not \nwait till you get technicalitie=\r\ns correct. Just start sadhana as I mentioned \nearlier and commit 1-2 hours =\r\nof your time everyday and see what happens.\n\nWhat sanatana dharma and Vedic=\r\n wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas \nwho *experience* mantras at th=\r\ne highest level and yet remain free from pride \nand ego and become purified=\r\n instruments of the Mother to carry out Her will \nwith actions of far-reach=\r\ning consequences without a trace of ego in those \nactions. This is possible=\r\n not by learning technicalities and nuances, but by \ndeveloping devotion, s=\r\nurrender and conscious effort with constant \ncontemplation.\n\nBest regards,\n=\r\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=\r\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri =\r\nTarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastros=\r\ntudent@ yahoo.com&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Friday, Janua=\r\nry 16, 2009 1:49 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Curious about the real mean=\r\ning of Bijaksharas:\nStill not satisfied\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; Thank you ve=\r\nry much for your reply. I am still not satisfied with\n&gt; the answer though, =\r\nespecially since I am sure I can get a lot more\n&gt; out of you :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; See, t=\r\nhe explanation that &quot;repetitive chanting calms/anchors the\n&gt; mind&quot; is only =\r\na &quot;placebo&quot; of an answer.

So this explanation does =\r\nnothing more than appease the\n&gt; atheistic scientific mind, one that is unwi=\r\nlling to consider (let\n&gt; alone accept) the non-material part of the univers=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am looking for a deeper answer that addresses the above concerns.\n=\r\n&gt; Please bear with me in reading the following paragraph in its\n&gt; entirety =\r\nbefore replying - I know I am not presenting new\n&gt; information to you, but =\r\nmerely presenting things as I know them, so\n&gt; you may reply/correct my thin=\r\nking as appropriate: More\n&gt; specifically, when I read Vivekacudamani, I am =\r\nled to believe that\n&gt; the manifested universe is all and only the quintupli=\r\ncated tattwas.\n&gt; The gross human being is no different (i.e. is also quintu=\r\nplicated\n&gt; tattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deeper non-mate=\r\nrial\n&gt; universe. In that deeper universe, which is the source of the\n&gt; mate=\r\nrial universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other\n&gt; things, t=\r\nhe antahakarana, which has the\n&gt; reflecting/consider ing/theorizing mind th=\r\nat we are all so familiar\n&gt; with. It experiences the quintuplicated univers=\r\ne, yet is directly\n&gt; part of the unquintuplicated universe! At an even deep=\r\ner level, even\n&gt; this subtle body is a manifestation of the causal body - m=\r\nahat,\n&gt; which consists of the three gunas. The manifesting/ enlivening agen=\r\nt,\n&gt; so to speak, is the non-dual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated\n&gt; consc=\r\niousness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, in the above scheme of things, how do mantra and diety f=\r\nigure?\n&gt; Spoken/chanted/ heard mantra is nothing more than an &quot;energic&quot;\n&gt; a=\r\nctivity of the most external part of the universe i.e. the\n&gt; quintuplicated=\r\n tattwa universe. Clearly this energic activity by\n&gt; itself, *if* limited t=\r\no the quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,\n&gt; clearly, we must accept th=\r\nat if mantra is to have ANY enlightening\n&gt; effect, mantra must resonate in =\r\nthe mind itself, which is part of\n&gt; the antahakarana. Right? Now, since min=\r\nd itself is NON-material,\n&gt; what does resonate mean at the mind level? We a=\r\nre no longer talking\n&gt; about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non=\r\n-material mental\n&gt; energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n It is this non-material mental energy that I wish to understand when\n&gt; I a=\r\nsk about mantras and beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it\n&gt; tattwa, pra=\r\nna, chitta, ahamkara, manas, karma, what? Why do specific\n&gt; harmonics of it=\r\n correspond to specific dieties? What exactly *is* a\n&gt; diety in terms of th=\r\ne above terminology? What is the cause-effect\n&gt; relationship between harmon=\r\nics of this energy and the disintegration\n&gt; of the subtle and causal bodies=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope you appreciate the direction/thrust of my querying..\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincere=\r\nly,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R=\r\n. Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is quite relevant =\r\nand not at all inappropriate. Let me give\n&gt; the crux of\n&gt;&gt; the philosophy.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place to a=\r\nnother\n&gt; very rapidly\n&gt;&gt; and gives varied emotions such as pride, shame, an=\r\nger, sadness\n&gt; etc. When the\n&gt;&gt; mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable=\r\n, one can experience\n&gt; the bliss of\n&gt;&gt; finding the true Self. The goal of a=\r\nll spiritual sadhana - japam,\n&gt; homam,\n&gt;&gt; dhyanam, contemplation and variou=\r\ns rituals - is to enable the mind\n&gt; to become\n&gt;&gt; calm.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At first, one =\r\ncannot make the mind stable and calm. All one can do\n&gt; it to tie\n&gt;&gt; the mon=\r\nkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still moves\n&gt; around,\n&gt;&gt; bu=\r\nt its motion is restricted. Once it goes far, the thread tying\n&gt; it to the\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; pole stops it from going further away. Similarly, when one tries\n&gt; to fo=\r\ncus on\n&gt;&gt; a mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one constantly\n&gt;=\r\n brings it\n&gt;&gt; back to the mantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the m=\r\nantra.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tri=\r\nes\n&gt; to become\n&gt;&gt; calm and stable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After trying enough, just as monke=\r\ny tied to a pole may stop\n&gt; jumping around\n&gt;&gt; and fall asleep holding on to=\r\n the pole, the mind may stop thinking\n&gt; of so\n&gt;&gt; many things and become abs=\r\nolutely calm and stable while repeating\n&gt; a mantra.\n&gt;&gt; When all the thought=\r\ns cease and some level of silence comes to the\n&gt; mind, one\n&gt;&gt; experiences s=\r\nome level of bliss.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is a combination of soun=\r\nds that is repeated by the\n&gt; mind to aid\n&gt;&gt; mind to stop wandering from one=\r\n thing to another thing. The goal\n&gt; is to give\n&gt;&gt; an anchor for the mind to=\r\n focus on, instead of jumping everywhere.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various sound combinations =\r\ncan be used for this purpose. For\n&gt; example, one\n&gt;&gt; can even repeat &quot;I want=\r\n to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every\n&gt; combination of\n&gt;&gt; sounds is capable=\r\n of making the mind calm after repeating it\n&gt; enough. Sound\n&gt;&gt; patterns mak=\r\ning sense in various languages were used by some\n&gt; saints and\n&gt;&gt; messiahs f=\r\nrom time to time in the past to obtain bliss and those\n&gt; sound\n&gt;&gt; patterns =\r\nare revered as being sacred in various religions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Compared to long se=\r\nquence of sounds, short sound patterns are\n&gt; easier to\n&gt;&gt; focus the mind on=\r\n. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24\n&gt; letters/syllables, a\n&gt;&gt; part of th=\r\ne mind is responsible for changing from one letter to\n&gt; another and\n&gt;&gt; ther=\r\ne is more mind activity even in a state of high mental focus\n&gt; on the\n&gt;&gt; ma=\r\nntra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly, the task is\n&gt; simpler for=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; the mind and it is easier for the mind to shut down various tasks\n&gt; of =\r\nthe\n&gt;&gt; mind and become close to being still and silent.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various sylla=\r\nbles can be used for this purpose. These syllables\n&gt; are called\n&gt;&gt; beeja ak=\r\nsharas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Beeja means a seed. Beeja akshara means a seed sy=\r\nllable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When mind has absolutely no activity and becomes completely s=\r\ntill\n&gt; (i.e.\n&gt;&gt; ceases to exist!), one realizes the true Self (Aatman or Br=\r\nahman).\n&gt; When mind\n&gt;&gt; has very little activity and becomes nearly still (i=\r\n.e. still\n&gt; exists, but in\n&gt;&gt; a very high state of focus and calmness), one=\r\n realizes different\n&gt; pure\n&gt;&gt; manifestations of cosmic being.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When on=\r\ne meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the above state\n&gt; of high\n&gt;&gt; men=\r\ntal focus and calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thoughts other than\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; repe=\r\ntition of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a seed\n&gt; corresponding to a\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; deity. The energy of that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness when\n&gt; one&#39;s mi=\r\nnd is\n&gt;&gt; filled with that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. In\n&gt; ot=\r\nher words,\n&gt;&gt; each deity is a personifications of the state of a mind that =\r\nis\n&gt; focused on\n&gt;&gt; the sound of a specific beeja with no other thoughts in =\r\nit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, if one&#39;s mind has many thoughts while repe=\r\nating a beeja\n&gt; akshara\n&gt;&gt; (or any mantra in general), one may experience a=\r\n lot of emotions\n&gt; and things.\n&gt;&gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still=\r\n and calm with no thought\n&gt; in it\n&gt;&gt; (other than what is needed for repeati=\r\nng that sound), we can say\n&gt; that one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; individual ego has been replaced=\r\n with that of a deity and the\n&gt; deity has\n&gt;&gt; filled one&#39;s mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus,=\r\n focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one\n&gt; experience the\n&gt;&gt; ene=\r\nrgy of a deity.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Which syllables make one experience which=\r\n energy was well-\n&gt; understood and\n&gt;&gt; catalogued by ancient Hindu sages nic=\r\nely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Many mantras other than beeja aksharas were also experiemented b=\r\ny\n&gt; rishis,\n&gt;&gt; who understood the nature of energy experienced by one&#39;s min=\r\nd when\n&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; mind is completely filled with the sound of the mantra an=\r\nd all\n&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; thoughts leave the mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So we need not experiment n=\r\newly. We can use the knowledge\n&gt; discovered by\n&gt;&gt; rishis and go further.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologe=\r\nr.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisd=\r\nom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Mes=\r\nsage ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is my first time posting on the vedic-=\r\nwisdom group.

You are correct that =\r\n&quot;we are no longer &lt;BR&gt;talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking=\r\n of non-material mental &lt;BR&gt;energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the =\r\nmind&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mind is the connection between what you called external unive=\r\nrse and what &lt;BR&gt;you called the deeper non-material universe. Mind has acce=\r\nss to ALL realms &lt;BR&gt;of experience, but it normally focuses on the physical=\r\n/material realm. &lt;BR&gt;Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm o=\r\nf experience through &lt;BR&gt;effort, it is not easy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give a small=\r\n analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic being (wh=\r\no thinks all that &lt;BR&gt;all of us think, who desires all that all of us desir=\r\ne, who knows all that &lt;BR&gt;all of us know, and who does all that all of us d=\r\no) is like the bottommost &lt;BR&gt;layer of ocean. Various\n deities are like int=\r\nermediate layers. Various &lt;BR&gt;objects of the external material world that a=\r\nre perceived by our senses are &lt;BR&gt;like the ripples on the surface of the o=\r\ncean. Objects on the surface &lt;BR&gt;perceive other objects on the surface arou=\r\nnd them. One&#39;s body and the senses &lt;BR&gt;attached to it are an object on the =\r\nsurface in the analogy. When one&#39;s mind &lt;BR&gt;identifies &quot;self&quot; with that bod=\r\ny and its senses, it perceives objects as &lt;BR&gt;perceived by those senses. Wh=\r\nen one successfully detaches mind from that &lt;BR&gt;self-identity and identifie=\r\ns with another object in the ocean in a different &lt;BR&gt;layer, one may percei=\r\nve a different reality. An example was in yesterday&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mail on mystical =\r\nexperiences.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as the ocean is vast and deep and has infinite obj=\r\nects at infinite &lt;BR&gt;depths, this universe has infinite possible self-ident=\r\nities. As one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;self-awareness is focused on a specific object, one has=\r\n specific &lt;BR&gt;experience/percepti on of self\n and &quot;others&quot;. When self-aware=\r\nness changes to a &lt;BR&gt;different object, one has a different experience/perc=\r\nepti on of self and &lt;BR&gt;&quot;others&quot;. However, this is theoretical discussion f=\r\nor most people, as they &lt;BR&gt;cannot imagine self-awareness changing. The sel=\r\nf-awareness of most people is &lt;BR&gt;focused on their body with its senses and=\r\n their experience/percepti on of &lt;BR&gt;self is the body and &quot;others&quot; is vario=\r\nus objects as perceived through the &lt;BR&gt;senses attached to that body. But, =\r\nit IS possible for one&#39;s self-awareness &lt;BR&gt;to go from an object on the oce=\r\nan surface in the analogy to a layer in the &lt;BR&gt;mdidle of the ocean or even=\r\n a bottommost layer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Repetition of a mantra is only a tool for calmi=\r\nng down the mental activity &lt;BR&gt;that keeps feeding this self-awareness. Min=\r\nd is identifying with a physical &lt;BR&gt;object made with gross matter (body). =\r\nBy keeping it busy with a particular &lt;BR&gt;repetitive activity, you have a ch=\r\nance of cutting off its identification\n &lt;BR&gt;with that object. As an analogy=\r\n, suppose a kid saw a rope right next to him &lt;BR&gt;and thought it was a snake=\r\n and was scared. You may tell him no, but still &lt;BR&gt;the thought &quot;snake is n=\r\next to me&quot; will keep scaring him. If you keep him &lt;BR&gt;busy with an activity=\r\n that he immerses in, the thought of snake next to him &lt;BR&gt;may vanish from =\r\nhis mind slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the identification of mind with the body is cu=\r\nt off or weakened, mind &lt;BR&gt;will have to identify with something else. Imag=\r\nine a frog clinging to a rock &lt;BR&gt;on an ocean surface. If it is afraid of s=\r\nlipping and holds on the rock &lt;BR&gt;tightly, its thoughts are on the rock alw=\r\nays. If the frog stops thinking &lt;BR&gt;about rock and becomes absorbed in some=\r\n other thoughts, it may slip from the &lt;BR&gt;rock. If it starts sinking in the=\r\n ocean, it will get hold of something else &lt;BR&gt;on the way to the ocean bed =\r\n(otherwise, it will drop all the way to the &lt;BR&gt;ocean bed. Though that is n=\r\not a bad thing at all, the frog\n is afraid of it &lt;BR&gt;and instinctively grab=\r\ns something on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind &lt;BR&gt;will get a hold o=\r\nf another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) &lt;BR&gt;and develop an=\r\nother self-awareness, i.e. a perception of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;In the exa=\r\nmple from last night, the perception of &quot;I&quot; was not the body, but &lt;BR&gt;a tin=\r\ny particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberated with the &lt;BR&gt;so=\r\nund of a beejaakshara. The perception of &quot;others&quot; was millions of &lt;BR&gt;parti=\r\ncles of the same wave of energy engaged in making the same sound and &lt;BR&gt;ab=\r\norbed in the same sound.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me come back to what you wrote: &quot;if man=\r\ntra is to have ANY enlightening &lt;BR&gt;effect, mantra must resonate in the min=\r\nd itself. ... We are no longer &lt;BR&gt;talking about physical energy (sound), w=\r\ne are talking of non-material mental &lt;BR&gt;energy - the mental equivalent of =\r\nsound in the mind.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mind or individualized consciousness is just a w=\r\nindow to the universe. If\n a &lt;BR&gt;room has window on the east, you see what =\r\nis on the east. If a room has &lt;BR&gt;window on the west, you see what is on th=\r\ne west. And so on. The sound of the &lt;BR&gt;mantra IS resonating somewhere (act=\r\nually, everywhere) in the universe. A &lt;BR&gt;mind with a strong self-identific=\r\nation with a body is bombarded by the sense &lt;BR&gt;inputs of that body, just a=\r\ns a room with an open window on the south is &lt;BR&gt;filled with cold wind blow=\r\ning from the south and bombarded by the &lt;BR&gt;floodlights installed outside o=\r\nn the south. You have to close that window &lt;BR&gt;and open window elsewhere to=\r\n get something else. If self-identification with &lt;BR&gt;body is weakened, the =\r\nbombardment of sense inputs weakens and the window of &lt;BR&gt;mind can open to =\r\nthe mantra that resonates in the universe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I said earlier that =\r\na vaccum should be created in the mind for the &lt;BR&gt;mantra and the deity to =\r\nfill, this is what I was referring to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different object=\r\ns of the universe,\n including human beings and deities, are &lt;BR&gt;made up of =\r\ngross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each object of the &lt;BR&gt;universe ha=\r\ns different perceptions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. Each object of the &lt;BR&gt;univers=\r\ne has different energies, i.e. different abilities to affect &lt;BR&gt;interactio=\r\nns between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The energy of an object is the energy t=\r\nhat brought that object into being. &lt;BR&gt;Deities are objects with tremendous=\r\n energy. But one cannot get close to a &lt;BR&gt;deity unless one overcomes attac=\r\nhment to individualized ego and its &lt;BR&gt;potential energy. One needs to conv=\r\nert that potential energy into kinetic &lt;BR&gt;energy that helps one break away=\r\n from that ego and approach a deity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the long run, none of those =\r\nobjects is permanent. None of those energies &lt;BR&gt;is permanent. In terms of =\r\nthe previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to an &lt;BR&gt;object on the way to=\r\n the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is to not &lt;BR&gt;view any objec=\r\nt as &quot;I&quot; and\n not consider any energy as &quot;mine&quot;. The final goal &lt;BR&gt;is to d=\r\nrop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, without any &lt;BR&gt;sense=\r\n of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please realize two fu=\r\nndamental things:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced *after=\r\n* the sadhana is fruitful &lt;BR&gt;and one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indir=\r\nect tool for overcoming ego. If &lt;BR&gt;one thinks that he is doing a powerful =\r\nmantra and its energy will free him &lt;BR&gt;from ego, one is mistakened. One MU=\r\nST put in conscious effort with constant &lt;BR&gt;contemplation to weed out ego =\r\nand pride to make one&#39;s sadhana fruitful. &lt;BR&gt;Mantra does not replace that =\r\nneed. Instead, it works hands in hand with that &lt;BR&gt;and depends on that.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) When one succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;should not think that &quot;I did it&quot; or &quot;I created that energy in my mind&quot;=\r\n. One &lt;BR&gt;does not do anything (other than *undoing* what one did previousl=\r\ny, viz\n &lt;BR&gt;putting together of a complex and weird self-identity called a =\r\nbody with so &lt;BR&gt;many things attached to it and so many pre-conceived notio=\r\nns about the &lt;BR&gt;world). The energy of the mantra IS already there and reso=\r\nnating everywhere. &lt;BR&gt;When mind experiences that energy and fills with it,=\r\n it is simply *tuning* &lt;BR&gt;to something pre-existing and not really creatin=\r\ng something or doing &lt;BR&gt;something. It is like a radio tuning to a differen=\r\nt channel and one &lt;BR&gt;listening to newer and better music or a driver drivi=\r\nng on a different &lt;BR&gt;scenic road and viewing beautiful and better scenery.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If all repetitive chanting were equal, mantra sha=\r\nstra would be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1/2 a page of text, not more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I never said the=\r\ny were equal. Perfect absorption into different mantras &lt;BR&gt;fills the mind =\r\nwith different kinds of enegies (associated with different &lt;BR&gt;deities). So=\r\n there is a lot of difference to chronicle. In terms of my ocean\n &lt;BR&gt;analo=\r\ngy, the possible experiences when one is absorbed into a mantra are as &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nvast as an ocean.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlt=\r\ny absorbed into the mantra &lt;BR&gt;and a vacuum has to be created in the mind f=\r\nor the mantra and its deity to &lt;BR&gt;fill. Other factors related to the speci=\r\nfic details in each mantra are &lt;BR&gt;secondary. I want to de-emphasize all ot=\r\nher things and emphasize this &lt;BR&gt;essential thing, i.e. control over ego.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One wanting to drive a car on various roads needs a detailed book giv=\r\ning all &lt;BR&gt;the maps. But my point is that one should first learn driving. =\r\nWhat makes &lt;BR&gt;one an expert driver going to various places is not possessi=\r\non of thousand &lt;BR&gt;maps but the basic driving skill. One not knowing drivin=\r\ng will crash the car &lt;BR&gt;even if he possesses thousand maps. One good at dr=\r\niving may manage without &lt;BR&gt;maps too. People emphasize complicated, mystif=\r\nied and nuanced knowledge and &lt;BR&gt;forget the basic\n essence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want to categorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are =\r\nneither &lt;BR&gt;necessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress.=\r\n One may &lt;BR&gt;spend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anythin=\r\ng.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despit=\r\ne not &lt;BR&gt;knowing the nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally to o=\r\nne who gets &lt;BR&gt;some mastery over the essential factors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The proof o=\r\nf the pudding is in eating it. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara &lt;BR&gt;and me=\r\nditate on it silently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit &lt;BR&gt;com=\r\nfortably with the back, neck and head erect, eyes closed and mind as calm &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;as possible. Avoid all physical movement and remain as still as you can.=\r\n If &lt;BR&gt;you have an urge to move, suppress it as long as you can and keep p=\r\nushing &lt;BR&gt;the limit everyday. Try your best to focus the mind on mantra. D=\r\no this &lt;BR&gt;meditation sitting in the same\n place, facing the same direction=\r\n and at &lt;BR&gt;around the same time everyday. Do this for one year and see for=\r\n yourself if &lt;BR&gt;it does something to you or not, despite not paying attent=\r\nion to the &lt;BR&gt;technicalities and nuances!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some nuances=\r\n are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most &lt;BR&gt;people.=\r\n For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti and keelaka of &lt;BR&gt;t=\r\nhe mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa. Those are all &lt;BR&gt;re=\r\nlevant only to a person of a high level of self-awareness, which is not &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;the case with most people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give an analogy. There may be som=\r\ne nuances related to how to lift the &lt;BR&gt;foot up and land the foot while ru=\r\nnning, to maximize the speed. They are &lt;BR&gt;irrelevant to a small baby who c=\r\nannot yet walk and only crawls. When the &lt;BR&gt;baby learns how to walk and la=\r\nter how to run, those details will most likely &lt;BR&gt;come to him naturally. E=\r\nvem without them, one will run\n fine, perhaps a &lt;BR&gt;little&lt;BR&gt;slower. Thus,=\r\n there is no point in trying to learn the nuances of running &lt;BR&gt;when one i=\r\ns still crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances of &lt;BR&gt;running m=\r\nay even make one&#39;s learning of walking very slow - it is a &lt;BR&gt;distraction!=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I answered whatever questions I could answer and felt =\r\nlike answering.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What we need today is not people who can discuss the=\r\nory in detail and have &lt;BR&gt;an intellectual understanding of things. In fact=\r\n, these things are beyond &lt;BR&gt;intellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana=\r\n is far more important. Do not &lt;BR&gt;wait till you get technicalities correct=\r\n. Just start sadhana as I mentioned &lt;BR&gt;earlier and commit 1-2 hours of you=\r\nr time everyday and see what happens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What sanatana dharma and Vedic=\r\n wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas &lt;BR&gt;who *experience* mantras at=\r\n the highest level and yet remain free from pride &lt;BR&gt;and ego and become pu=\r\nrified instruments of\n the Mother to carry out Her will &lt;BR&gt;with actions of=\r\n far-reaching consequences without a trace of ego in those &lt;BR&gt;actions. Thi=\r\ns is possible not by learning technicalities and nuances, but by &lt;BR&gt;develo=\r\nping devotion, surrender and conscious effort with constant &lt;BR&gt;contemplati=\r\non.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast.\n net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;Fro=\r\nm: &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedicastrostudent%40yahoo.com&quot;=\r\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedicastrostudent@ yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To:=\r\n &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Friday, January=\r\n 16, 2009 1:49 PM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Curious about the real mea=\r\nning of Bijaksharas:&lt;BR&gt;Still not satisfied&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your reply. I am still not satisfied with&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; the answer though, especially since I am sure I\n can get a lot more&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; out of you :-)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; See, the explanation that &quot;repetitive=\r\n chanting calms/anchors the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind&quot; is only a &quot;placebo&quot; of an answer.=\r\n It does not do any justice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the obviously highly nuanced mantra =\r\nshastra. If all repetitive&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chanting were equal, mantra shastra woul=\r\nd be 1/2 a page of text, not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; more. So this explanation does nothing=\r\n more than appease the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; atheistic scientific mind, one that is unwil=\r\nling to consider (let&lt;BR&gt;&gt; alone accept) the non-material part of the un=\r\niverse.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am looking for a deeper answer that addresses the=\r\n above concerns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Please bear with me in reading the following parag=\r\nraph in its&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entirety before replying - I know I am not presenting n=\r\new&lt;BR&gt;&gt; information to you, but merely presenting things as I know them,=\r\n so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you may reply/correct my thinking as appropriate: More&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nspecifically, when I read Vivekacudamani, I am\n led to believe that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n the manifested universe is all and only the quintuplicated tattwas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; The gross human being is no different (i.e. is also quintuplicated&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; tattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deeper non-material&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; universe. In that deeper universe, which is the source of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; m=\r\naterial universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nthings, the antahakarana, which has the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reflecting/consider ing/the=\r\norizing mind that we are all so familiar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with. It experiences the q=\r\nuintuplicated universe, yet is directly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; part of the unquintuplicate=\r\nd universe! At an even deeper level, even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; this subtle body is a man=\r\nifestation of the causal body - mahat,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; which consists of the three =\r\ngunas. The manifesting/ enlivening agent,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so to speak, is the non-d=\r\nual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Now, in the above scheme of things,\n how do mantra and diety figure?&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Spoken/chanted/ heard mantra is nothing more than an &quot;energic&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nactivity of the most external part of the universe i.e. the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; quintup=\r\nlicated tattwa universe. Clearly this energic activity by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; itself, *=\r\nif* limited to the quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; clearly=\r\n, we must accept that if mantra is to have ANY enlightening&lt;BR&gt;&gt; effect,=\r\n mantra must resonate in the mind itself, which is part of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the anta=\r\nhakarana. Right? Now, since mind itself is NON-material,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what does =\r\nresonate mean at the mind level? We are no longer talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about phy=\r\nsical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental&lt;BR&gt;&gt; energy =\r\n- the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is this no=\r\nn-material mental energy that I wish to understand when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I ask about=\r\n mantras and beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tattwa, prana=\r\n, chitta, ahamkara, manas,\n karma, what? Why do specific&lt;BR&gt;&gt; harmonics =\r\nof it correspond to specific dieties? What exactly *is* a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; diety in =\r\nterms of the above terminology? What is the cause-effect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; relationsh=\r\nip between harmonics of this energy and the disintegration&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the s=\r\nubtle and causal bodies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hope you appreciate the direction/=\r\nthrust of my querying..&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sincerely,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sundeep&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha=\r\n P.V.R. Rao&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Su=\r\nndeep,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite relevant and not at all inappr=\r\nopriate. Let me give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the crux of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the philosophy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The mind is like a monkey. =\r\nIt wanders from one place to another&lt;BR&gt;&gt; very rapidly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and g=\r\nives varied emotions such\n as pride, shame, anger, sadness&lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc. Whe=\r\nn the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can expe=\r\nrience&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the bliss of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; finding the true Self. The goal of =\r\nall spiritual sadhana - japam,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; homam,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dhyanam, contempl=\r\nation and various rituals - is to enable the mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to become&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; calm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; At first, one cannot make the mind stabl=\r\ne and calm. All one can do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it to tie&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the monkey (mind) =\r\nto a fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still moves&lt;BR&gt;&gt; around,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; but its motion is restricted. Once it goes far, the thread tying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nit to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; pole stops it from going further away. Similarly, whe=\r\nn one tries&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to focus on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders=\r\n to other things, one constantly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; brings it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; back to the =\r\nmantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; Thus, mantra\n is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; to become&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; calm and stable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; After tr=\r\nying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop&lt;BR&gt;&gt; jumping around&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; and fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop think=\r\ning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of so&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; many things and become absolutely calm and st=\r\nable while repeating&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When all the thoughts ce=\r\nase and some level of silence comes to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind, one&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ex=\r\nperiences some level of bliss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; mind to aid&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind to stop wandering from one thing to ano=\r\nther thing. The goal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is to give&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; an anchor for the mind =\r\nto focus on, instead of jumping everywhere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Various=\r\n sound combinations can be used for this purpose. For&lt;BR&gt;&gt; example, one&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt;\n can even repeat &quot;I want to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; combination of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; sounds is capable of making the mind calm=\r\n after repeating it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough. Sound&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; patterns making sense=\r\n in various languages were used by some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; saints and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mess=\r\niahs from time to time in the past to obtain bliss and those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sound&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; patterns are revered as being sacred in various religions.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Compared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patter=\r\nns are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; easier to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; focus the mind on. If you repeat a man=\r\ntra with 32 or 24&lt;BR&gt;&gt; letters/syllables, a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; part of the mind=\r\n is responsible for changing from one letter to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; another and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; there is more mind activity even in a state of high mental focus&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mantra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly, t=\r\nhe task is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; simpler for&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the mind and it is easier for th=\r\ne\n mind to shut down various tasks&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind and beco=\r\nme close to being still and silent.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Various syllabl=\r\nes can be used for this purpose. These syllables&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are called&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; beeja aksharas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nBeeja means a seed. Beeja akshara means a seed syllable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; When mind has absolutely no activity and becomes completely still&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; (i.e.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ceases to exist!), one realizes the true Self (Aatma=\r\nn or Brahman).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; has very little activity and b=\r\necomes nearly still (i.e. still&lt;BR&gt;&gt; exists, but in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a very h=\r\nigh state of focus and calmness), one realizes different&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pure&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; manifestations of cosmic being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When one med=\r\nitates on a beeja akshara and attains the above state&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of high&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; mental focus and calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thoughts other\n than&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; repetition of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a s=\r\need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; corresponding to a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; deity. The energy of that deity =\r\nfills one&#39;s consciousness when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s mind is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; filled wit=\r\nh that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. In&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other words,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; each deity is a personifications of the state of a mind that is&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; focused on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the sound of a specific beeja with no other t=\r\nhoughts in it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Of cou=\r\nrse, if one&#39;s mind has many thoughts while repeating a beeja&lt;BR&gt;&gt; akshar=\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; (or any mantra in general), one may experience a lot of emoti=\r\nons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and things.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly sti=\r\nll and calm with no thought&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; (other than what is n=\r\needed for repeating that sound), we can say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that one&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nindividual ego has been replaced with that of a deity and\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deit=\r\ny has&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; filled one&#39;s mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus, focused =\r\nmeditation on a beeja akshara can make one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; experience the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; energy of a deity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Which syllables make one experience which energy was well-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; underst=\r\nood and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; catalogued by ancient Hindu sages nicely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; Many mantras other than beeja aksharas were also experiemented b=\r\ny&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rishis,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; who understood the nature of energy experienc=\r\ned by one&#39;s mind when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind is completely filled w=\r\nith the sound of the mantra and all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; thoughts leav=\r\ne the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; So we need not experiment newly. We can=\r\n use the knowledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; discovered by&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; rishis and go further.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; --=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------=\r\n\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear all,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; This is my first time posting on the vedic-wisdom group.
