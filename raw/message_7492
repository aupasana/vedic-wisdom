Around Navaratri this year I \n&gt; have completed a 108 times r=\r\necitation of chandipath over two/three \n&gt; months and that was indeed one of=\r\n the best periods of my life so far. \n&gt; Although there is nothing that mani=\r\nfested in terms of material benefits, \n&gt; my overall mood was pretty elevate=\r\nd/calm most of the time. After that, \n&gt; however I am not able to practise i=\r\nt so much and I don&#39;t enjoy that same \n&gt; bliss anymore. But whenever I do C=\r\nhandipath, that day in general my \n&gt; mental state is pretty calm. However, =\r\nit is a tough sadhana to do \n&gt; everyday. The Path alone takes around an hou=\r\nr to recite, that too if you \n&gt; superfast, which you are not supposed to, a=\r\nccording to the book. If you \n&gt; recite at comfortable speed, it takes aroun=\r\nd 1 hour 20 minutes just for \n&gt; the 13 chapters. Add the kavacham, argala, =\r\nkeelaka, ratrisuktam, \n&gt; artharvaseersham before and devi sooktam, three ra=\r\nhasyams, kshama \n&gt; prathana and siddha kunjika strotram you are taking 2 to=\r\n 2.5 hours. For \n&gt; me that seems impossible on a daily basis. So, I have tr=\r\nied to do 2/3 \n&gt; chapters a day for daily practise but that does not give m=\r\ne the same \n&gt; bliss that I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So, I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw how to \n&gt; practise this regularly on a permanent basis.

One who does a \n&gt; Chandipath thrice a day for a=\r\n few years at leasts, ends up transforming \n&gt; himself completely from being=\r\n an ordinary, average, limited, frail human \n&gt; being to a &#39;god&#39; of sorts. O=\r\nur religion teaches the transformation of \n&gt; how a man becomes a god. Not G=\r\n-d but god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Strength, courage, confidence, devotion, knowledge, applic=\r\nation of \n&gt; special knowledge, authority (if one so desires it), power, wis=\r\ndom, \n&gt; spiritual experiences, liberation, enlightenment etc - everything c=\r\nomes \n&gt; from this one text. It is a whole package.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually you get =\r\nwhat you crave for deep down. It is not too difficult \n&gt; to master the text=\r\n. Some effort, some patience and it can be done. Spend \n&gt; one hour daily pr=\r\nacticing the text and in 3 months you can read it \n&gt; whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best of lu=\r\nck.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: A small word of caution. Maybe not re=\r\nlevant right now, but if ever \n&gt; by Her will you become an accomplished Cha=\r\nndi sadhaka in future then \n&gt; this will be of help. Don&#39;t ask for anything =\r\nwhen doing Her worship is \n&gt; an ideal situation. If you pray simply as you =\r\npray in any temple, then \n&gt; too there is not a problem. Praying with humili=\r\nty is never a problem. \n&gt; BUT if ever you try out kriyas with Chandi or do =\r\nthe Chandipath to get \n&gt; xyz results in abc timeframe, (specially during co=\r\nmplex forms of worship \n&gt; of Chandi like those involving charnel grounds), =\r\nthen be sure that you \n&gt; know the precise and exact procedures. There are n=\r\no half measures in \n&gt; those.

She doesn&#39;t openly protest it, but she get stressed and it starts a=\r\nffecting her health. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Regards, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Nagraj&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 11/21/11, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BOR=\r\nDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Making time for sadhana (Re: Why Sapthshati mantras..)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, November 21, 2011, 4:03 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV id=3Dyiv472151001&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV=\r\n id=3Dyiv472151001ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;[&lt;BR&gt;He now does Chandi homam=\r\n with entire Saptashati everyday.

Around Navaratri this year I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have completed a 108 times recita=\r\ntion of chandipath over two/three &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months and that was indeed one o=\r\nf the best periods of my life so far. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Although there is nothing th=\r\nat manifested in terms of material benefits, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; my overall mood was p=\r\nretty elevated/calm most of the time. After that, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; however I am not=\r\n able to practise it so much and I don&#39;t enjoy that same &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bliss any=\r\nmore. But whenever I do Chandipath, that day in general my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental =\r\nstate is pretty calm. However, it is a tough sadhana to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; everyda=\r\ny. The Path alone takes around an hour to recite, that too if you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nsuperfast, which you are not supposed to, according to the book. If you &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; recite at comfortable speed, it takes around 1 hour 20 minutes just f=\r\nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the 13 chapters. Add the kavacham, argala, keelaka,\n ratrisukta=\r\nm, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; artharvaseersham before and devi sooktam, three rahasyams, ksha=\r\nma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; prathana and siddha kunjika strotram you are taking 2 to 2.5 ho=\r\nurs. For &lt;BR&gt;&gt; me that seems impossible on a daily basis. So, I have tri=\r\ned to do 2/3 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; chapters a day for daily practise but that does not g=\r\nive me the same &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bliss that I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So, =\r\nI don&#39;t know how to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; practise this regularly on a permanent basis. =\r\nAny inputs from you?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nagraj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Sat, 1=\r\n1/19/11, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From=\r\n: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Why Sapthshati mantras is called Siddha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantra?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &quot;=\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc829.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdo=\r\nm%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://us.mc829.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Saturday, November=\r\n 19, 2011, 1:03 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Rakesh,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The Chand=\r\niPath is a text which can bestow all the four aims of life as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ment=\r\nioned in scriptures - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moskha. One who does a &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Chandipath thrice a day for a few years at leasts, ends up transforming =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; himself completely from being an ordinary, average, limited, frail=\r\n human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; being to a &#39;god&#39; of sorts. Our religion teaches the transfo=\r\nrmation of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; how a man becomes a god. Not G-d but god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Strength, courage, confidence, devotion, knowledge, application of &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; special knowledge, authority (if one so desires it), power, wisdom, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; spiritual experiences, liberation, enlightenment etc -\n everything c=\r\nomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from this one text. It is a whole package.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; E=\r\nventually you get what you crave for deep down. It is not too difficult &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; to master the text. Some effort, some patience and it can be done. Sp=\r\nend &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one hour daily practicing the text and in 3 months you can rea=\r\nd it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; whole.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best of luck.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regar=\r\nds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS: A small word of caution. Maybe not=\r\n relevant right now, but if ever &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by Her will you become an accompl=\r\nished Chandi sadhaka in future then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this will be of help. Don&#39;t as=\r\nk for anything when doing Her worship is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an ideal situation. If yo=\r\nu pray simply as you pray in any temple, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; too there is not a p=\r\nroblem. Praying with humility is never a problem. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BUT if ever you =\r\ntry out kriyas with Chandi or do the Chandipath to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; xyz results=\r\n in abc timeframe, (specially during complex forms of\n worship &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of =\r\nChandi like those involving charnel grounds), then be sure that you &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; know the precise and exact procedures. There are no half measures in &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; those. Nishkama worship in complex methods is fine, but desire for &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; material results without the knowledge of the procedures during compl=\r\nex &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rituals in begging for trouble, whoever you might be.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ami Jantra Tumi Jantri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ami Ghar Tumi Gharani&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ami Ratha Tumi Rathi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jemon Chalao Temni Chali&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ___________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; From: rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://us.mc829.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 16 November=\r\n 2011 11:09 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Why\n Sapthshati mantras =\r\nis called Siddha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantra?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Can u pls elaborate about durga sapathshati, its benefits, and uses=\r\n in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; general man life, also if i have to start reading chapters men=\r\nas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; increasing one by one so pls tell me imortance viz how should i=\r\n increase&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1] 1 m fully comfortable in reading chap 11, now=\r\n started reading 2, 4,5&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rakesh&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc829.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc829.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://us.mc829.mail.yah=\r\noo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; , ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Dear Pri=\r\nyank, =C3=83=E2=80=9A The document refers to samputikaran mantras for the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandi.
