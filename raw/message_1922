However, =\r\ndo not apply the Pingala-Ida (right-left) division in this case. When you h=\r\nave a two-fold division, then the solar/lunar or right/left or Pingala/Ida =\r\nor devatas/pitris division comes into play.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the case of Vishnu&#39;s i=\r\nncarnation, there aren&#39;t just two. We have nine incarnations. So we are tal=\r\nking about a nine-fold division in this mapping. So we have all the nine pl=\r\nanets in play. This has nothing to do with left or right channels.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Within each person, Sun represents the soul, Moon r=\r\nepresents the mind, Mars represents the energy and initiative, Mercury repr=\r\nesents the learning ability, Jupiter represents the intellect, wisdom and j=\r\nudgment, Venus represents the spirit of enjoyment and bliss, Saturn represe=\r\nnts the spirit of hard work or discipline.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vishnu represents pure sat=\r\ntwa. Rama is Vishnu&#39;s incarnation with Sun&#39;s nature. Krishna is Vishnu&#39;s in=\r\ncarnation with Moon&#39;s nature. Sun being the soul, Rama is from the soul pri=\r\nnciple of the cosmic being.

Lord Rama was a Vishnu Avataar and procla=\r\nimed by our scriptures as a &#39;Purnaavataar&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; how come then you stat=\r\ne difference between their level of evolution?\n&gt;  \n&gt; An arrow, a simple cha=\r\nin and a necklace with an elaborate work may all be made from the same 22 c=\r\naret gold. You may call an object made with 22 caret gold to be purer than =\r\nan object made with 14 caret gold. But if the arrow, chain and beautiful ne=\r\ncklace are all made of 22 caret gold, they are all equally pure. Simply bec=\r\nause the necklace required more work, it is nore purer.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, Ra=\r\nma and Krishna were both from Vishnu - pure sattwa. One is not more &quot;evolve=\r\nd&quot; than the other. They just served different purposes (like the arrow and =\r\nnecklace made of the same 22 pure gold) and hence had different qualities.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like I said, earlier, Rama and Krishna are from the soul and mind pri=\r\nnciples of the cosmic being.
