Actually, I was doing homam in basement for about a year, and =\r\nit went through the ventiliation system and we had black soot destroying ou=\r\nr carpet and depositing on our walls. I have since stopped totally in the h=\r\nome. Would only do outside-in the garage now.\n \nRemedy was to remove the ca=\r\nrpet and get hardwood/laminate flooring. And there is a chemical dry sponge=\r\n which can be used to pick up soot from walls. Usually it is used in places=\r\n with fire damage. google chemical dry sponge. I am in Canada and ordered f=\r\nrom USA. Then we cleaned off the walls with TSP mix with water and re-paint=\r\ned the home. So yeah, overall the experience has been a dent in the bank ac=\r\ncount, but hopefully it has been worth it. so try chemical sponge and tsp s=\r\nolution, then paint. Soot gets eveerywhere. If in N. America, make sure to =\r\nchange your furnace filter EVERY MONTH, get duct cleaning every year, & avo=\r\nid inside if possible to avoid this. \n\nP\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Jitender Dahiya&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Since =\r\na lot of people aare doing homam in a room, can somebody please let me know=\r\n how do they handle the soot that gets deposited on the walls of the room.\n=\r\n&gt; I m in pune.
