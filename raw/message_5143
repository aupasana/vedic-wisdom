Swamigal was\nserious=\r\nly looking at the cover\nin front of the learned members and was looking at =\r\none line written as PIN\nCode and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the=\r\n learned members to\nexplain the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell t=\r\nhat. But everyone\nunderstood the significance of that number. Then swamigal=\r\n asked his crew\nmember to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his l=\r\nibrary and read\nthe meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that =\r\neven the meaning\nof PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves =\r\nthe purpose and\npeople are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowi=\r\nng the meaning of\nVishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of cha=\r\nnting the stothsram\nwas he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring s=\r\nome clue to our\ndiscussion forum\nRamanaPatham\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 9:=\r\n10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Girish,\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I am not at all against knowing the meaning, so that one can immerse\n&gt; on=\r\neself in what one is chanting. That is definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIf that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; compo=\r\nsed by an elevated being even without understanding the meaning is very\n&gt; u=\r\nseful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham\n&gt;=\r\n means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of\n&gt; every=\r\nthing and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can\n&gt; still=\r\n benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is more\n&gt; likel=\r\ny because one does not have the correct attitude and surrender and\n&gt; probab=\r\nly not because one does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; Atharvasee=\r\nrsham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; experience n=\r\nothing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many laye=\r\nrs and\n&gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important laye=\r\nrs are\n&gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of meaning are neve=\r\nr\n&gt; understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether=\r\n you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and\n&gt; relaxed mi=\r\nnd and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a target\n&gt; count and r=\r\nace through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty. If it\n&gt; is done =\r\neven with a little bit of love and surrender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; some=\r\nthing. The key to success with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; min=\r\nd is filled with thousands of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt;=\r\n one of those thousand activities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; =\r\nsubside and mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt;=\r\n one experiences a mantra.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a=\r\n mantra, physical vibration is\n&gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery=\r\n in the mind, the thoughts and\n&gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscio=\r\nus mind etc. Some mantras composed\n&gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis=\r\n (essentially beings with very stable\n&gt; and calm minds) are designed such t=\r\nhat the physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; can eventually cause the corresp=\r\nonding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; when other mental activity subsi=\r\ndes. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; calming the mind down, you can =\r\nrecreate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; in your mind. That can perm=\r\nanently alter the way your mind workd. But the\n&gt; key is to attain a reasona=\r\nbly stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpret=\r\nation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power=\r\n of their own, as they were\n&gt; realized souls. In comparison, for examplle, =\r\nSatyadevaashtakam composed by\n&gt; me, though in metrical Sanskrit, will not h=\r\nave a similar power.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;ht=\r\ntp://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;geniusgirish@...&lt;geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.=\r\nin&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; Would it not be of immense help to the ordi=\r\nnary person whose knowledge of\n&gt; Sanskrit is limited not only to &quot;understan=\r\nd&quot; what he says but also take more\n&gt; interest, enjoyment, and truly get imm=\r\nersed in what he is reciting/ reading?\n&gt; &gt; I think this is the reason for t=\r\nhe great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar to\n&gt; compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in=\r\n Marathi.\n&gt; &gt; But I agree with you that the sacred stotras should be recite=\r\nd in\n&gt; sanskrit...\n&gt; &gt; Humbly,\n&gt; &gt; Girish Shahapurkar\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 2=\r\n6/10/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@... &lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Translations, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik\n&gt; &gt; To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesda=\r\ny, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will give m=\r\ny 2 cents on a few points.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I once wanted to translate=\r\n Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu\n&gt; in poetic form, so that Tel=\r\nugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to\n&gt; read or feel uncomforta=\r\nble because they do not know the meaning, can read\n&gt; the Telugu version ins=\r\ntead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; He asked me, &quot;who d=\r\no you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered\n&gt; later, but firm=\r\nly told me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please note that the =\r\ngoal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; mantras and prayers,=\r\n is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they\n&gt; mean. They are to=\r\nols to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are\n&gt; storehouses of s=\r\nome shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; in the past.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the righ=\r\nt mood, right\n&gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a ma=\r\nntra that was\n&gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually und=\r\nerstand\n&gt; can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a=\r\n normal\n&gt; person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So,=\r\n I suggest\n&gt; not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading =\r\nSanskrit\n&gt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cri=\r\ncket, a batsman may\n&gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots=\r\n, how to see the ball\n&gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how =\r\nget into the line of the\n&gt; ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when t=\r\no play front foot and when\n&gt; to play back foot etc. But that does not neces=\r\nsarily make one a good\n&gt; batsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a goo=\r\nd player. Of course, some\n&gt; basic understanding of principles is needed. Bu=\r\nt, above that, practice is\n&gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spiritual=\r\nity\n&gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nessence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; very s=\r\nimple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing\n&gt; things=\r\n and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; thro=\r\nugh each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding\n&gt; reacti=\r\nons. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I\n&gt; am =\r\ndoing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt;=\r\n is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded agai=\r\nn\n&gt; and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this understanding =\r\nfully\n&gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellect=\r\nually\n&gt; understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures =\r\nis at the\n&gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watchin=\r\ng over one&#39;s\n&gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts=\r\n, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; scr=\r\niptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically\n&gt; =\r\nor virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create=\r\n\n&gt; a theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all=\r\n of\n&gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of w=\r\nhat is\n&gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person running around a mou=\r\nntain,\n&gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excel=\r\nlent\n&gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs =\r\nto climb\n&gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climb=\r\ning it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that =\r\ninitiation is important in tantric path but\n&gt; not in Vedic path, I want to =\r\nadd my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *di=\r\nstinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot of in=\r\naccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs =\r\nVedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants =\r\nspecific material results needs to be\n&gt; careful regarding how to go about i=\r\nt. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a\n&gt; particular result is not easy. It=\r\n requires supervision of a good guru and\n&gt; not many are left anyway. On the=\r\n other hand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; specific material results and is l=\r\nooking for spiritual progress, the\n&gt; constraints are fewer and options more=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path =\r\nis for begetting\n&gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for self-rea=\r\nlization. That is\n&gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant M=\r\nanyu sooktam for\n&gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, =\r\nand so on.\n&gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance i=\r\nn an elaborate\n&gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and t=\r\no remove the\n&gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific ma=\r\nterial result,\n&gt; you need clear guidance and supervision, which not many ar=\r\ne capable of\n&gt; giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an=\r\n increase of\n&gt; your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without init=\r\niation or\n&gt; guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-minded=\r\n people.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need=\r\n clear and precise\n&gt; directions and some supervision. If you just want to g=\r\no to north pole, you\n&gt; can keep walking towards north. Of course, having su=\r\npervision helps there\n&gt; too, but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam an=\r\nd Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.=\r\norg&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@... &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English o=\r\nr any\n&gt; &gt;other regional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;=\r\nconstant\n&gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text=\r\n in a\n&gt; language that they can fully follow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, i=\r\nf this is the reason then its understandable.

Having quickly\n&gt; browsed through this particular thread, I thought th=\r\nat I might reply to\n&gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpa=\r\nl ji has raised an important question regarding the necessity\n&gt; of initiati=\r\non. I will address it after summarizing the big picture that\n&gt; needs to be =\r\ninvoked in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY\n&gt; answers poss=\r\nible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one?\n&gt; Generally speaki=\r\nng if the question is whether initiation is an absolute\n&gt; requirement for s=\r\npiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if\n&gt; the question is =\r\nabout the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; enjoined by =\r\n*Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2?YES.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde m=\r\nunde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; necessity for m=\r\nultiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; inevitability of m=\r\nultiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are\n&gt; many paths for =\r\nsadhana. But in the current context of this question I will\n&gt; restrict myse=\r\nlf to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (P=\r\nsycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. B=\r\nhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual pa=\r\nth and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is n=\r\nothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; abstract Truths of the Cosmo=\r\ns. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular\n&gt; methods and techniques i=\r\nn its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at\n&gt; an experiential leve=\r\nl. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/\n&gt; techniques employed by=\r\n each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriente=\r\nd to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; speaking even the external guru is not neces=\r\nsary, though one can greatly\n&gt; benefit from the wisdom and experience of a =\r\ngenuine teacher. The direct path\n&gt; of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viv=\r\neka (Discernment) and Vichara\n&gt; (self-reflection). Advaita being essentiall=\r\ny a culmination of the Vaidik\n&gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice =\r\nof &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular\n&gt; self-study of texts) too as an important practice=\r\n. All of these practices\n&gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal =\r\nrole for external practices.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasi=\r\nses Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent\n&gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reac=\r\ntivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;=\r\nIswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; the Supreme Iswara) too whil=\r\ne Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; emphasise only the first two as t=\r\nhey subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (=\r\nLove/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; Iswara&#39;s will throu=\r\ngh total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; emphasis in Karma =\r\nmarga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; Engaging in actions=\r\n without attachment to the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; Karma marga of the =\r\nGita.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path o=\r\nf mantra sadhana where\n&gt; alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and t=\r\nhereby the necessity of a\n&gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practi=\r\ncalization of certain occult\n&gt; truths via the energetics of Sabda through t=\r\nhe employment of Vak. It\n&gt; presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab =\r\nexperiment and thereby\n&gt; certain regulations and safe practices. It should =\r\nbe remembered that except\n&gt; Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at =\r\nvarious levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; predominantly invokes Soma (the reference he=\r\nre is to the age-old\n&gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, =\r\none path invokes/employs\n&gt; the fire of the intellect, another the fire of s=\r\npeech, another the fire of\n&gt; austerity, and yet another the physical fire o=\r\nf the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invo=\r\nking fire deals with the fire of Vak through\n&gt; the lab-like practical mantr=\r\nasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful\n&gt; techniques that bring resul=\r\nts more quickly it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not about=\r\n authority but more about qualification.\n&gt; Would you allow a child to exper=\r\niment with fire without any supervision?\n&gt; Does the supervisor need experie=\r\nnce and training or not? Like any other lab\n&gt; experiment proper training an=\r\nd experience are part of the procedure apart\n&gt; from certain safety measures=\r\n, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the\n&gt; lab is one&#39;s own conscio=\r\nusness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; within the individual=\r\n consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; As this is not a to=\r\npic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; further discussion =\r\non the Kundalini. Without going into other needless\n&gt; details here, I will =\r\njust elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise\n&gt; it =\r\nwithin the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river\n&gt; w=\r\nithin the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta\n&gt; s=\r\nadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools\n&gt; t=\r\nhat are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula,=\r\n\n&gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst =\r\nSri\n&gt; Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more compl=\r\nete the\n&gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To tho=\r\nse who are\n&gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the th=\r\ne 21 forms of\n&gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook a=\r\ns well as the\n&gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not\n&gt; =\r\ninvoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the\n=\r\n&gt; major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra,\n&gt;=\r\n bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronisti=\r\nc\n&gt; frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fl=\r\nedged\n&gt; entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of th=\r\nat path\n&gt; (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE wi=\r\nth SIVA\n&gt; himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and\n=\r\n&gt; sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individ=\r\nual\n&gt; sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another =\r\nmodern\n&gt; metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by th=\r\ne Tantric\n&gt; advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessa=\r\nry for the\n&gt; conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagin=\r\ne many\n&gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of =\r\nlive wires, where\n&gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent pr=\r\nactice all the way up\n&gt; till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (=\r\nPrakasa) and Sound\n&gt; (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the=\r\n\n&gt; individual consciousness through an integrated approach that combines th=\r\ne\n&gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and\n&gt;=\r\n Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated approaches\n&gt;=\r\n that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly=\r\n\n&gt; starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fledged\n&gt; A=\r\ndvaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text=\r\n\n&gt; on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiation is\n&gt; r=\r\nelevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employing the text=\r\n\n&gt; as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, t=\r\nhe\n&gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in =\r\nmy\n&gt; write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri=\r\n Sri\n&gt; Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections throu=\r\ngh its\n&gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glor=\r\ny in the text is the\n&gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full=\r\n-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I =\r\nalone exist in this\n&gt; universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Comp=\r\nare it with the other\n&gt; Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the cen=\r\ntral truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the=\r\n non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; other regional language is becaus=\r\ne understanding the meaning and constant\n&gt; reflection are possible only whe=\r\nn one repeatedly reads the text in a\n&gt; language that they can fully follow.=\r\n The main idea of the writeup is to\n&gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Y=\r\nogic text too apart from its obvious\n&gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri S=\r\nri Chandi is also equally regarded as\n&gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, esp=\r\necially the four hymns. In that regard\n&gt; all the applications of Veda mantr=\r\nas or the Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence=\r\n the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the origin=\r\nal Vedic method will straightaway\n&gt; identify that Yagnya is the central Ved=\r\nic practice. In fact even the worship\n&gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple =\r\nis fully based on and DERIVED from a one\n&gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yaga=\r\nsala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practi=\r\ntioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in acc=\r\nordance with the Vedic approach, there are those\n&gt; who adhere to the Tantri=\r\nc approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra\n&gt; marga. It is this particu=\r\nlar approach that needs initiation as per its own\n&gt; principles. Initiation =\r\nis not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; Viveka and Vichara, o=\r\nr the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt; Pauranic approach o=\r\nf reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; Homam too is not req=\r\nuired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik\n&gt; practice of Ritu=\r\nal/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these\n&gt; approaches to Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the\n&gt; living and breathing tr=\r\naditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; practiced originally in v=\r\narious parts of the subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; themselves to Tantra ma=\r\nrga and hence the importance of initiation for those\n&gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; Sri=\r\n Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can m=\r\nake spiritual progress through any of the\n&gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sr=\r\ni Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya=\r\n, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc\n&gt; are all effective. However depend=\r\ning on the individual temperament, aptitude\n&gt; etc., some of these methods a=\r\nre more suited relatively to different\n&gt; practitioners. One may progress th=\r\nrough a combination of any of these\n&gt; methods in spiritual life. However th=\r\ne *full-fledged* integrated approach of\n&gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha t=\r\noo. It is this big picture against which\n&gt; the answer to the question has t=\r\no be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irr=\r\nespective of the method and path,\n&gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most ef=\r\nfective methods for all of us.\n&gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts f=\r\nollowed by reflection on the\n&gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is best =\r\ndone in a language that one is\n&gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it=\r\n is the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alterna=\r\nte method (though not as\n&gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is=\r\n Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; alone that enables one to make rapid progress in=\r\n spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtu=\r\ne of serving, listening\n&gt; to and spending time in the company of sadhus and=\r\n sants in his younger days.\n&gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a=\r\n quantum leap in their\n&gt; spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha =\r\nof Ramakrishna,\n&gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha now=\r\nadays, I\n&gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There i=\r\ns a complaint by householders nowadays that there\n&gt; are no good Mahatmas. T=\r\nhis is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a\n&gt; question of supply and d=\r\nemand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will\n&gt; come at once. This i=\r\ns the inexorable law of nature. If you are really\n&gt; thirsty, you will find =\r\nyour Master at your threshold. You lead a\n&gt; happy-go-lucky life, your mind =\r\nis full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do\n&gt; not care a bit for higher d=\r\nivine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping\n&gt; and vain, worldly talks=\r\n. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed,\n&gt; and name and fame. =\r\nAnd yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; Make yourself a de=\r\nserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you\n&gt; to the lotus-fe=\r\net of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide\n&gt; you and ele=\r\nvate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; waiting =\r\nto get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; Rea=\r\nl seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; Mahatmas.&quot; M=\r\nahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; after Tru=\r\nth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this =\r\nforum is an opportunity for\n&gt; Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bha=\r\nvana, this group too is a\n&gt; potential Satsangha though not comparable to th=\r\ne actual company of the great\n&gt; masters.

However, one without a rich father is still better of=\r\nf\n&gt; opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slowly wi=\r\nth\n&gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sa=\r\ndhana\n&gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you f=\r\nind a\n&gt; guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), =\r\nget\n&gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n=\r\n&gt; getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrend=\r\ner\n&gt; and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not =\r\nthat\n&gt; important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru ca=\r\nn\n&gt; prepare one sufficiently.

Nature has destabilized the whole sy=\r\nstem, for a\n&gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and ritua=\r\nls only for\n&gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever material results god w=\r\nants to give\n&gt; and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals=\r\n for begetting\n&gt; *specific* material results (for oneself or others or soci=\r\nety/universe in\n&gt; general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get co=\r\nrrect knowledge of\n&gt; such rituals.

Tha=\r\nt attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4)=\r\n Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are\n&gt; fewer hiccups. Fi=\r\nerce deities give results fast, but there may be some\n&gt; hiccups. I gave thi=\r\ns analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking\n&gt; rotten fruits fro=\r\nm a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to\n&gt; retrieve one =\r\ngood fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do\n&gt; it gently=\r\n and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; the p=\r\nerson is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage\n&gt; of=\r\n rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; fr=\r\nuits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; ba=\r\nsket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n=\r\n&gt; give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity\n=\r\n&gt; like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n=\r\n&gt; fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit\n=\r\n&gt; comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remembe=\r\nr that these fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; creations, but fruits of your own act=\r\nions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; to eat each of those rotten fruit=\r\ns before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevert=\r\nheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; fruits is bette=\r\nr off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with\n&gt; gentler dei=\r\nties. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a\n&gt; guru befo=\r\nre starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start\n&gt; mantras w=\r\nithout initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize\n&gt; that it=\r\n is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate\n&gt; goo=\r\nd results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life a=\r\nnd were\n&gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who t=\r\nook several\n&gt; hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years ba=\r\nck are now\n&gt; doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I know tha=\r\nt some of them\n&gt; have transformed a lot and have experienced some things to=\r\no. Obviously, they\n&gt; have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce =\r\naspects of Divine\n&gt; Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; has=\r\n even a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for\n&gt; g=\r\nod and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that\n=\r\n&gt; person obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has d=\r\none\n&gt; that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adh=\r\nikara.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understan=\r\nding of what is what, how\n&gt; things work, why one should do something, how t=\r\no do it, what is more\n&gt; important and what is less important, that is what =\r\ninitiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nH.Ramalingam\n\nManaging Director\n\n=\r\nShri Ramana Heavy Engineering Private Limited\n\nNo.769, 59th Street, 10th Se=\r\nctor, K.K.nagar\n\nChennai-600078\n\nPh: Off-044-23662346\n\nCell: +91-93847 4196=\r\n9\n\n+91-99620 31969\n\n+91-99406 51969\n\nEmail: hramalingam@...\n\nhram=\r\nalingam@...\n\r\n--00163628480a1e6fd804938797cf\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste everybody&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I want to share one anecdote happened in =\r\nfront of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One da=\r\ny all the learned persons male and female alike&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;requested Swamig=\r\nal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada language so that they ca=\r\nn chant knowing the meaning fully.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to =\r\nthis request which was made early in the morning. Later in the day after th=\r\ne days pooja etc were over as usual Postman came to camp to deliver the pos=\r\nts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was seriously looking at the cove=\r\nr&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;in front of the learned members and was looking at=A0one line=\r\n=A0written as=A0PIN Code and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the lea=\r\nrned members to explain the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that.=\r\n But everyone understood the significance of that number. Then swamigal ask=\r\ned his crew member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his l=\r\nibrary and read the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that =\r\neven the meaning of PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves =\r\nthe purpose and people are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowi=\r\nng the meaning of Vishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of cha=\r\nnting the stothsram was he told the group.

That is definit=\r\nely the ideal situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that is not possible, what I am saying i=\r\ns that reading something composed by an elevated being even without underst=\r\nanding the meaning is very useful. Suppose someone does not understand what=\r\n Ganapathi Atharvaseersham means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapath=\r\ni as the source of everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ga=\r\nnapathi. One can still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anythi=\r\nng, it is more likely because one does not have the correct attitude and su=\r\nrrender and probably not because one does know the specific meaning of Gana=\r\npathi Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may als=\r\no experience nothing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The words uttered by a realized soul have mea=\r\nnings at many layers and literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Som=\r\ne important layers are lost in translation. The most important layers of me=\r\naning are never understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm =\r\nand relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a target=\r\n count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty. If i=\r\nt is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the deity, it can=\r\n do something. The key to success with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If=\r\n a mind is filled with thousands of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is =\r\njust one of those thousand activities, nothing will happen. If most thought=\r\ns subside and mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when=\r\n one experiences a mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;There are 4 levels of sabda. When one sa=\r\nys a mantra, physical vibration is accompanied in other layers by the image=\r\nry in the mind, the thoughts and instincts in the conscious and sub-conscio=\r\nus mind etc. Some mantras composed by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (=\r\nessentially beings with very stable and calm minds) are designed such that =\r\nthe physical vibration of the mantra can eventually cause the corresponding=\r\n imagery in the mind by resonance, when other mental activity subsides. Thu=\r\ns, after repeating the mantra and calming the mind down, you can recreate a=\r\n certain imagery and thought system in your mind. That can permanently alte=\r\nr the way your mind workd. But the key is to attain a reasonably stable, fo=\r\ncused and calm mind.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation =\r\nof BhagavadGita and Sant Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power of =\r\ntheir own, as they were realized souls. In comparison, for examplle, Satyad=\r\nevaashtakam composed by me, though in metrical Sanskrit, will not have a si=\r\nmilar power. \n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;-----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n--------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;----=\r\n Girish Shahapurkar &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;geniusgirish@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Sir,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; Would it not be of immense help to the ordinary person whose knowledge=\r\n of Sanskrit is limited not only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but=\r\n also take more interest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is r=\r\neciting/ reading?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I think this is the reason for the great saints =\r\nlike Sant Dnyaneshwar to compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nBut I agree with you that the sacred stotras should be recited in sanskrit.=\r\n.. &lt;br&gt;&gt; Humbly,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Girish Shahapurkar&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- On Tue=\r\n, 26/10/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; From: Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pvr@c=\r\nharter.net&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Translations, Initiatio=\r\nn, Vedic vs Tantrik&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Date: Tue=\r\nsday, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; I will give my 2 cents on a few points.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother ton=\r\ngue Telugu in poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too co=\r\nmplicated to read or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meanin=\r\ng, can read the Telugu version instead. When I floated the idea, Manish dis=\r\ncouraged me. He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said tha=\r\nt it could be considered later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for the=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Please note that the goal of sadhana=\r\n, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT just an i=\r\nntellectual understanding of what they mean. They are tools to silence the =\r\nmind and channel its energy. They are storehouses of some shakti left by ri=\r\nshis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the past.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right m=\r\nood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra =\r\nthat was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intel=\r\nlectually understand can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the=\r\n words of a normal person that one can intellectually understand and apprec=\r\niate. So, I suggest not worrying about whether one understands or not and r=\r\neading Sanskrit mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; If I wer=\r\ne to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot =\r\nof scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the ha=\r\nnd of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how =\r\nto play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play ba=\r\nck foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one =\r\npractices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some basic understan=\r\nding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more important t=\r\nhan bookish knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Similarly, some =\r\nconceptual understanding is important in spirituality also, but above that,=\r\n sadhana is more important.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The essence =\r\nof all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. It =\r\nis that we should overcome the notions that we are doing things and realize=\r\n that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each being=\r\n based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goe=\r\ns through the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I am doing&quo=\r\nt;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; et=\r\nc. Though this is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may b=\r\ne deluded again and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this un=\r\nderstanding fully and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &qu=\r\not;this is mine&quot; etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; So, even if =\r\none practices a mantra that one does not intellectually understand, that is=\r\n ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the back of one&#39;s=\r\n mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s own thou=\r\nghts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana wil=\r\nl yield results.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is =\r\nfine to read scriptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual peopl=\r\ne (physically or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that wi=\r\nll only create a theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and t=\r\no govern all of one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do =\r\nsadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One doing sadhana without a ba=\r\nsic theoretical understanding of what is what and what we want, is like a b=\r\nlind person running around a mountain, instead of climbing it. One not doin=\r\ng sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical understanfing, is like a per=\r\nson who knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but keeps staring at the=\r\n pinnacle instead of climbing it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Regarding the statement that initiation=\r\n is important in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cen=\r\nts.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are=\r\n two *distinct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There are a lot=\r\n of inaccurate notions today.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The issue =\r\nis not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and what on=\r\ne wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be careful re=\r\ngarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a particular=\r\n result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and not many ar=\r\ne left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specific materi=\r\nal results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints are fewer=\r\n and options more.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Some may sub-conscio=\r\nusly have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material res=\r\nults and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, =\r\none in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or =\r\nAyushya sooktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik pat=\r\nh may eat a gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion =\r\nthat &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towards =\r\nsome objects.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific mat=\r\nerial result, you need clear guidance and supervision, which not many are c=\r\napable of giving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an incr=\r\nease of your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation =\r\nor guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After all, if you want to go to Calcutt=\r\na, you need clear and precise directions and some supervision. If you just =\r\nwant to go to north pole, you can keep walking towards north. Of course, ha=\r\nving supervision helps there too, but you can do without it!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Films=\r\n that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n ---- vedic_pathak &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic_pathak@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste Satya Prakash Ji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any &gt;other r=\r\negional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;constant refl=\r\nection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a langua=\r\nge that they can fully follow.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its understandable.

Whats your opinion on this.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Please take your time!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpa=\r\nl&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am forwarding a reply sent by Dr Satya Prakash=\r\n Choudhary.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dat=\r\ne: Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:10:31 -0000&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &=\r\nquot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;mindcareclinic@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom-owner%40yahoogroups.com&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom-owner@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Subject: Initiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Mean=\r\ning)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte friends,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; All Glories to the Goddess!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am Satya Prakash, the author of the write-up posted =\r\nhere. Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet =\r\nforums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted=\r\n on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the=\r\n original post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quick=\r\nly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphe=\r\nre here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having q=\r\nuickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might reply=\r\n to Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the=\r\n necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big pictu=\r\nre that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the=\r\n MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? =\r\nGenerally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an absolute req=\r\nuirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the =\r\nquestion is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as en=\r\njoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2?YES.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; =\r\nas the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches an=\r\nd multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. I=\r\nn the pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the curre=\r\nnt context of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that ar=\r\ne relevant to the discussion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti mar=\r\nga (Love/Devotion)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- =\r\nRitual path and/or Selfless Actions)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisati=\r\non of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPH=\r\nASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the=\r\n abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predo=\r\nminant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita=\r\n, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can=\r\n greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The d=\r\nirect path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vi=\r\nchara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vai=\r\ndik system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regu=\r\nlar self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practic=\r\nes involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for externa=\r\nl practices.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) an=\r\nd Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additi=\r\nonally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the =\r\nSupreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise o=\r\nnly the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) =\r\nemphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surr=\r\nender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Act=\r\nion as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachme=\r\nnt to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address=\r\n the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of=\r\n initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana invo=\r\nlves the practicalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sa=\r\nbda through the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent =\r\nto any lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. I=\r\nt should be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or A=\r\ngni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the referen=\r\nce here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke=\r\n Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire=\r\n of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fir=\r\ne of the Yagnya and so on.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire =\r\nof Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs hi=\r\nghly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emph=\r\nasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualificat=\r\nion. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervisio=\r\nn? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other =\r\nlab experiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apa=\r\nrt from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However=\r\n the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening =\r\nthe Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalin=\r\ni Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refra=\r\nin from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needl=\r\ness details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we a=\r\nre talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the lar=\r\nger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantri=\r\nc context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehens=\r\nively. However there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged=\r\n living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakul=\r\na. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belo=\r\nngs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among=\r\n the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with T=\r\nibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi.=\r\n Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas i=\r\nn its approach to sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is =\r\nnot invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at =\r\nthe major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra,=\r\n bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronisti=\r\nc frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fled=\r\nged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that p=\r\nath (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIV=\r\nA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-bran=\r\nches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhak=\r\na. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metap=\r\nhor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advo=\r\ncate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the condu=\r\nit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, whe=\r\nre there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the wa=\r\ny up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
