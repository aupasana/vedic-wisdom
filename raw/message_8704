I know these are excellent for health, and will try and do more. Thanks =\r\nfor reminding me.\n\nThe only &#39;meditation&#39; I currently do is japa. I focus on=\r\n the sound, but yes, b I do have a picture of Vishnu (as Guruvayoorappan of=\r\n the famous Kerala temple) to meditate on. \n\nI am travelling to Delhi tomor=\r\nrow, and then onwards to Rishikesh next week. Will definitely stand in wate=\r\nr and do a little japa (hope I can stand the freezing water of Mother Ganga=\r\n, which is incredibly cold even in peak summer). Thank you for this nice su=\r\nggestion.\n\nI agree brahmacharya is not easy, although essential in spiritua=\r\nl life. I feel the only way to get established in this is to offer any lowe=\r\nr thoughts such as lust, anger, greed, hatred, envy and pride to the Divine=\r\n. It&#39;s one hell of a battle though...\n\nBtw I recently started reading the &quot;=\r\nImitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas Kempis, a famous Catholic monk and saint fro=\r\nm 500 years ago. What an inspiring book....his words are so similar to the =\r\ninstructions given by our Indian sages. Very interesting and practical inst=\r\nructions for progress on the spiritual path. Just wanted to reccommend it t=\r\no anyone who is interested. \n\nhttp://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/eboo=\r\nks/new2/ImitationOfChrist-mcrst.pdf\n\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hell=\r\no,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0That is official standard reply for everyone who as=\r\nk such questions. After all there are many others who ask same things\n&gt; I w=\r\nill try to write few things which I did myself. May be it will help you.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 1--- Everything works because of Divine Grace. It is not our japa, tapa,=\r\n haven or other spiritual work which is cause of Darshan. No, it is Divine =\r\nGrace which shows us the path. Everything comes under it.\n&gt; 2-- Are you doi=\r\nng any pranayam or breathing exercises on a regular basis. Rebirthing exerc=\r\nise is lot like sudershankriya but much softer. Doing this or others will c=\r\nlear the nadis in the body and will bring new light even once a week.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n3--- Are you doing any meditations in your very busy and responsible life. =\r\n=A0Yoga nidra is a very good meditation and many times combining breathing =\r\nexercises and meditations even in 10/15 days works wonder.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4--- I hope=\r\n very much that you have a focus of your japa like a Beautiful Picture of D=\r\nivine Lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5--- Next time you go to Rishikesh, try to do some japa st=\r\nanding in SriGangaji after doing prayers to Her. But please do not take any=\r\n risks. When I did it on opposite bank, in month of December people kept a =\r\neye on me. Being a woman brings it own problem if there is no man there to =\r\nsupport. But you do not have to do it if you do not want it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6---You m=\r\night notice feeling of sex increases as the japa increases. It is a very di=\r\nfficult problem. You are a lucky person because you have women teachers in =\r\nyour ashram with whom you could talk. It is not that you need any advise be=\r\ncause people come to you for that. But it is a very difficult problem to de=\r\nal with in spiritual life\n&gt; \n&gt; 7---Please do not put blockage by saying tha=\r\nt you want Darshan even with inner eye. Let Them decide. After all you want=\r\n to see Them and They want to see you.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; 8--- Relax. I hope you are n=\r\not in any physical pain apart from longing for Darshan. So take things easy=\r\n. Let the spiritual energy slowly build up. Things will happen, Look for Di=\r\nvine Grace.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several other things which I did. I am sure you =\r\nwill also know.\n&gt; \n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________=\r\n________\n&gt;=A0 From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, 17 September 2012, 12:53\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Re: SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I rece=\r\nntly asked a senior monk at the Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh as to whether=\r\n it is possible to have Darshan of Narayana i.e. see Him in the form descri=\r\nbed in all our scriptures with 4 arms, holding the conch, discus, mace and =\r\nlotus. I said to him, there are countless stories of devotees having Darsha=\r\nn of their God, is it actually possible today, in this day and age?\n&gt; \n&gt; He=\r\n said, yes most certainly! But he said Darshan of God means feeling the Div=\r\nine Presence in yourself, and all things, living and non-living, in every a=\r\ntom, everywhere. This, he said, is Darshan.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am continuing with japa =\r\nin the hope of one day getting to this stage of feeling the presence of God=\r\n everywhere at all times. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, having said that, I have not given=\r\n up the idea of &#39;seeing&#39; God (may be with the &#39;inner eye&#39;) in the form of V=\r\nishnu and Krishna- yes, with mace, discus, flute and all!!\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bhagava=\r\ntam says that Dhruva, Prahlad, even the elephant king Gajendra saw Vishnu..=\r\n..then why not me?!! Of course I&#39;ll have to do a lot of japa, a lot of sadh=\r\nana, remove all negative emotions, become a paragon of virtue (Oh god!) but=\r\n I believe that if I do, it&#39;s bound to happen. May take a few lifetimes tho=\r\nugh (but I&#39;m going to try and do it this time, you&#39;ve got to try at least!)=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; If ulta Rama nama could transform rogue Ratnakar into saint Valmiki,=\r\n and grant him Darshan of Sri Rama, then why cannot Om NamoNarayana convert=\r\n rogue Aparna into saint Aparna one day and give her Darshan of Vishnu/Kris=\r\nhna....I believe that the mantra can do anything. Anything. We&#39;ll all be sa=\r\nints one day....ain&#39;t got no choice, He&#39;ll see to it. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for th=\r\ne message. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 I still ca=\r\nnnot understand why it is wrong to have a spiritual experiences or to think=\r\n about them. After all we cannot go to a shop and just buy them. If we are =\r\ndoing sadhana and we need support they are going to happen. Why deny them? =\r\nSuppose someone is doing the complete purscharan =A0of mantra, is to wrong =\r\n=A0not to expect something amazing might happen at the end of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSome years ago there was a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple i=\r\nn their home for several generations. Something happened in this authors li=\r\nfe and he felt lot of trauma and could not find mental peace. In his later =\r\nlife he took up doing prayers and japa etc as he was taught in his younger =\r\ndays. One night his daughter said to him, you are doing so much prayers etc=\r\n, have you had any experiences.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The author became upset and said, =\r\nno, he had not any experiences. Many times he thinks that he is siting in f=\r\nront of a stone in the temple and it is all useless. But he will not give u=\r\np his prayers as his time is coming nearer.\n&gt; &gt; Next morning when this auth=\r\nor was in his Temple and priest was doing ManglaAarti, The Deity\n&gt; &gt; Spoke =\r\nto him and comforted him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0Several days later when he went to a =\r\nfamous Temple in Rajasthan, again the Divine Lord spoke to him there and co=\r\nmforted him and said there is no difference between Him and Deities in his =\r\nhome Temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I read this story I knew immediately it was a tr=\r\nue story. Very similar things have happened with me to help me and comfort =\r\nme.=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are going from A to B. Is it a relentless journey? Are t=\r\nhere no breaks, petrol stations or shops where we can get out and stretch o=\r\nurselves. Are there any road signs. Spiritual experiences are like these. T=\r\nhey guide us and show us if we are on a right path.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was thinking=\r\n of writing to this devotee who had this powerful experience in Temple. Ple=\r\nase write about it. What you experienced and what really happened. It will =\r\ngive knowledge to others. But then I realised that I am a lone ranger here =\r\nand many times go against the stream.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0Many people are very youn=\r\ng here and take NarasimhaBhai as their guru or spiritual adviser. So if gur=\r\nuji is saying something, chela and clients cannot go against it. Othewise t=\r\nheir fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will be confiscated.=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was=\r\n also like this in my life. I took diksha=A0 from my Late Uncle who was fam=\r\nous in his days.\n&gt; &gt; When I tried to talk to him about Darshan of Divine Lo=\r\nrd, he became very negative and said it is not possible. I kept very quite.=\r\n I did not try to give examples of saints like Tulsidas or others who had D=\r\narshan. I had not done any spiritual sadhana and so no personal experiences=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; .=A0\n&gt; &gt; Since then my life has changed due to different spiritual ex=\r\nperiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not in a complete bliss all t=\r\nhe the time but I know Divine Beings can very easily give Darshan And havin=\r\ng spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tha=\r\nnks\n&gt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om ShaantihShaantihShaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!

I know these are excellent for health=\r\n, and will try and do more. Thanks for reminding me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The only &#39;medit=\r\nation&#39; I currently do is &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-17 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt;. I=\r\n focus on the sound, but yes, b I do have a picture of Vishnu (as &lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dmisspell-18 class=3Dmark&gt;Guruvayoorappan&lt;/SPAN&gt; of the famous &lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dmisspell-19 class=3Dmark&gt;Kerala&lt;/SPAN&gt; temple) to meditate on. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\n am travelling to Delhi tomorrow, and then onwards to &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-2=\r\n0 class=3Dmark&gt;Rishikesh&lt;/SPAN&gt; next week. Will definitely stand in water a=\r\nnd do a little &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-21 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt; (hope I can =\r\nstand the freezing water of Mother &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-22 class=3Dmark&gt;Gang=\r\na&lt;/SPAN&gt;, which is incredibly cold even in peak summer). Thank you for this=\r\n nice suggestion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I agree &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-23 class=3Dmark&gt;brahma=\r\ncharya&lt;/SPAN&gt; is not easy, although essential in\n spiritual life. I feel th=\r\ne only way to get established in this is to offer any lower thoughts such a=\r\ns lust, anger, greed, hatred, envy and pride to the Divine. It&#39;s one hell o=\r\nf a battle though...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-24 class=3Dmark&gt;Btw&lt;/SPAN&gt; =\r\nI recently started reading the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas Kempis, a fa=\r\nmous Catholic monk and saint from 500 years ago. What an inspiring book....=\r\nhis words are so similar to the instructions given by our Indian sages. Ver=\r\ny interesting and practical instructions for progress on the spiritual path=\r\n. Just wanted to &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-25 class=3Dmark&gt;reccommend&lt;/SPAN&gt; it t=\r\no anyone who is interested. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.consciouslivingfo=\r\nundation.org/ebooks/new2/ImitationOfChrist-mcrst.pdf&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http:=\r\n//www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/new2/ImitationOfChrist-mcrst.pdf=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warm regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-26 class=3Dmark&gt;Ap=\r\narna&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Hello,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is official stand=\r\nard reply for everyone who ask such questions. After all there are many oth=\r\ners who ask same things&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I will try to write few things which I did =\r\nmyself. May be it will help you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1--- Everything works bec=\r\nause of Divine Grace. It is not our &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-29 class=3Dmark&gt;jap=\r\na&lt;/SPAN&gt;, &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-30 class=3Dmark&gt;tapa&lt;/SPAN&gt;, haven or other s=\r\npiritual work which is cause of &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-31 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;. No, it is Divine Grace which shows us the path. Everything comes u=\r\nnder it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2-- Are you doing any &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-32 class=3Dmark&gt;=\r\npranayam&lt;/SPAN&gt; or breathing exercises on a regular basis. &lt;SPAN id=3Dmissp=\r\nell-33 class=3Dmark&gt;Rebirthing&lt;/SPAN&gt; exercise is lot\n like &lt;SPAN id=3Dmiss=\r\npell-34 class=3Dmark&gt;sudershankriya&lt;/SPAN&gt; but much softer. Doing this or o=\r\nthers will clear the &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-35 class=3Dmark&gt;nadis&lt;/SPAN&gt; in th=\r\ne body and will bring new light even once a week.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3--- Are=\r\n you doing any meditations in your very busy and responsible life. &nbsp;Yo=\r\nga &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-36 class=3Dmark&gt;nidra&lt;/SPAN&gt; is a very good meditati=\r\non and many times combining breathing exercises and meditations even in 10/=\r\n15 days works wonder.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4--- I hope very much that you have =\r\na focus of your &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-37 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt; like a Beau=\r\ntiful Picture of Divine Lord.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5--- Next time you go to &lt;SP=\r\nAN id=3Dmisspell-38 class=3Dmark&gt;Rishikesh&lt;/SPAN&gt;, try to do some &lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dmisspell-39 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt; standing in &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-40 =\r\nclass=3Dmark&gt;SriGangaji&lt;/SPAN&gt; after doing prayers to Her. But please do no=\r\nt take any risks. When I did it on opposite bank, in month of December\n peo=\r\nple kept a eye on me. Being a woman brings it own problem if there is no ma=\r\nn there to support. But you do not have to do it if you do not want it.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 6---You might notice feeling of sex increases as the &lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dmisspell-41 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt; increases. It is a very difficult p=\r\nroblem. You are a lucky person because you have women teachers in your ashr=\r\nam with whom you could talk. It is not that you need any advise because peo=\r\nple come to you for that. But it is a very difficult problem to deal with i=\r\nn spiritual life&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 7---Please do not put blockage by saying =\r\nthat you want &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-42 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; even with =\r\ninner eye. Let Them decide. After all you want to see Them and They want to=\r\n see you.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 8--- Relax. I hope you are not in any phys=\r\nical pain apart from longing for &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-43 class=3Dmark&gt;Darsha=\r\nn&lt;/SPAN&gt;. So take things easy. Let the spiritual energy slowly build up.\n T=\r\nhings will happen, Look for Divine Grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are severa=\r\nl other things which I did. I am sure you will also know.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-44 class=3Dmark&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, 17 Septembe=\r\nr 2012, 12:53&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hi &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-46 class=3Dmar=\r\nk&gt;LaxmiNarayanji&lt;/SPAN&gt;,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I recently asked a senior monk at=\r\n the &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-47 class=3Dmark&gt;Sivananda&lt;/SPAN&gt; Ashram in &lt;SPAN i=\r\nd=3Dmisspell-48 class=3Dmark&gt;Rishikesh&lt;/SPAN&gt; as to whether it is possible =\r\nto have &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-49 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; of &lt;SPAN id=3Dmi=\r\nsspell-50\n class=3Dmark&gt;Narayana&lt;/SPAN&gt; i.e. see Him in the form described =\r\nin all our scriptures with 4 arms, holding the conch, discus, mace and lotu=\r\ns. I said to him, there are countless stories of devotees having &lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dmisspell-51 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; of their God, is it actually pos=\r\nsible today, in this day and age?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He said, yes most certai=\r\nnly! But he said &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-52 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; of God =\r\nmeans feeling the Divine Presence in yourself, and all things, living and n=\r\non-living, in every atom, everywhere. This, he said, is &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell=\r\n-53 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am continuing with &lt;SPA=\r\nN id=3Dmisspell-54 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt; in the hope of one day getting =\r\nto this stage of feeling the presence of God everywhere at all times. &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, having said that, I have not given up the idea of &#39;se=\r\neing&#39; God (may be with the &#39;inner eye&#39;) in the form of Vishnu and Krishna- =\r\nyes, with mace, discus,\n flute and all!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The &lt;SPAN id=3Dmi=\r\nsspell-55 class=3Dmark&gt;Bhagavatam&lt;/SPAN&gt; says that &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-56 c=\r\nlass=3Dmark&gt;Dhruva&lt;/SPAN&gt;, &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-57 class=3Dmark&gt;Prahlad&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt;, even the elephant king &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-58 class=3Dmark&gt;Gajendra&lt;/SP=\r\nAN&gt; saw Vishnu....then why not me?!! Of course I&#39;ll have to do a lot of &lt;SP=\r\nAN id=3Dmisspell-59 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt;, a lot of &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-=\r\n60 class=3Dmark&gt;sadhana&lt;/SPAN&gt;, remove all negative emotions, become a para=\r\ngon of virtue (Oh god!) but I believe that if I do, it&#39;s bound to happen. M=\r\nay take a few lifetimes though (but I&#39;m going to try and do it this time, y=\r\nou&#39;ve got to try at least!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-61 cla=\r\nss=3Dmark&gt;ulta&lt;/SPAN&gt; Rama &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-62 class=3Dmark&gt;nama&lt;/SPAN&gt; =\r\ncould transform rogue &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-63 class=3Dmark&gt;Ratnakar&lt;/SPAN&gt; i=\r\nnto saint &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-64 class=3Dmark&gt;Valmiki&lt;/SPAN&gt;, and grant him=\r\n &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-65 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; of &lt;SPAN\n id=3Dmisspell=\r\n-66 class=3Dmark&gt;Sri&lt;/SPAN&gt; Rama, then why cannot Om &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-67=\r\n class=3Dmark&gt;NamoNarayana&lt;/SPAN&gt; convert rogue &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-68 clas=\r\ns=3Dmark&gt;Aparna&lt;/SPAN&gt; into saint &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-69 class=3Dmark&gt;Aparn=\r\na&lt;/SPAN&gt; one day and give her &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-70 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/=\r\nSPAN&gt; of Vishnu/Krishna....I believe that the mantra can do anything.

After all we cannot go to a sho=\r\np and\n just buy them. If we are doing &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-75 class=3Dmark&gt;s=\r\nadhana&lt;/SPAN&gt; and we need support they are going to happen. Why deny them? =\r\nSuppose someone is doing the complete &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-76 class=3Dmark&gt;p=\r\nurscharan&lt;/SPAN&gt; &nbsp;of mantra, is to wrong &nbsp;not to expect something=\r\n amazing might happen at the end of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some yea=\r\nrs ago there was a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple in their =\r\nhome for several generations. Something happened in this authors life and h=\r\ne felt lot of trauma and could not find mental peace. In his later life he =\r\ntook up doing prayers and &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-77 class=3Dmark&gt;japa&lt;/SPAN&gt; e=\r\ntc as he was taught in his younger days. One night his daughter said to him=\r\n, you are doing so much prayers etc, have you had any experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The author became upset and said, no, he had not any exp=\r\neriences. Many times he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in the=\r\n temple and\n it is all useless. But he will not give up his prayers as his =\r\ntime is coming nearer.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Next morning when this author was in hi=\r\ns Temple and priest was doing &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-78 class=3Dmark&gt;ManglaAar=\r\nti&lt;/SPAN&gt;, The Deity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spoke to him and comforted him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;Several days later when he went to a famous Temple =\r\nin &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-79 class=3Dmark&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/SPAN&gt;, again the Divine L=\r\nord spoke to him there and comforted him and said there is no difference be=\r\ntween Him and Deities in his home Temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When I=\r\n read this story I knew immediately it was a true story. Very similar thing=\r\ns have happened with me to help me and comfort me.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; We are going from A to B. Is it a relentless journey? Are there no=\r\n breaks, petrol stations or shops where we can get out and stretch ourselve=\r\ns. Are there any road signs. Spiritual experiences are like these. They gui=\r\nde us and\n show us if we are on a right path.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I =\r\nwas thinking of writing to this devotee who had this powerful experience in=\r\n Temple. Please write about it. What you experienced and what really happen=\r\ned. It will give knowledge to others. But then I realised that I am a lone =\r\nranger here and many times go against the stream.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &nbsp;Many people are very young here and take &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-80 cla=\r\nss=3Dmark&gt;NarasimhaBhai&lt;/SPAN&gt; as their guru or spiritual adviser. So if &lt;S=\r\nPAN id=3Dmisspell-81 class=3Dmark&gt;guruji&lt;/SPAN&gt; is saying something, &lt;SPAN =\r\nid=3Dmisspell-82 class=3Dmark&gt;chela&lt;/SPAN&gt; and clients cannot go against it=\r\n. &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-83 class=3Dmark&gt;Othewise&lt;/SPAN&gt; their fire-pot, ghee-=\r\npot and coco-pot will be confiscated.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I wa=\r\ns also like this in my life. I took &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-84 class=3Dmark&gt;dik=\r\nsha&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp; from my Late Uncle who was famous in his days.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; When I tried to talk\n to him about &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-85 class=3Dmark&gt;Da=\r\nrshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said it is not pos=\r\nsible. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of saints like &lt;SP=\r\nAN id=3Dmisspell-86 class=3Dmark&gt;Tulsidas&lt;/SPAN&gt; or others who had &lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dmisspell-87 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt;. I had not done any spiritual &lt;S=\r\nPAN id=3Dmisspell-88 class=3Dmark&gt;sadhana&lt;/SPAN&gt; and so no personal experie=\r\nnces.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; .&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Since then my life has changed due =\r\nto different spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not =\r\nin a complete bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings can very easi=\r\nly give &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-89 class=3Dmark&gt;Darshan&lt;/SPAN&gt; And having spiri=\r\ntual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Thanks&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-90 class=3Dmark&gt;LaxmiNaraya=\r\nn&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---------=\r\n---------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; || Om &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-91 =\r\nclass=3Dmark&gt;ShaantihShaantihShaantih&lt;/SPAN&gt; ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
