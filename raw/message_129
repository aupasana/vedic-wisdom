Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear =\r\nKumar ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, they use only dry coconut pieces. Wood definitely produ=\r\nces \nsmoke. If \n&gt; you use dry coconut pieces mainly and pour small quantiti=\r\nes of \nghee, there \n&gt; is hardly any smoke during homam. Only when the fire =\r\nfinally goes \naway can \n&gt; there be a good amount of smoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; Imagine tha=\r\nt you are stir-frying some vegetables in a bit of oil. \nIf you put \n&gt; too m=\r\nuch oil, oil will burn and produce smoke. If there isn&#39;t \nenough oil, \n&gt; ve=\r\ngetables will burn and produce smoke. If you balance vegetables \nand oil \n&gt;=\r\n correctly, there will be no smoke and vegetables will be cooked \nwell.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; However, in the cooking analogy, you abruptly turn off fire when \nthe \n&gt; =\r\nvegetables are ready. In a homam, you cannot do that. As long as \nthe cocon=\r\nut \n&gt; piecess, sesame seeds etc are burning, you keep pouring drops of \nghe=\r\ne at the \n&gt; right places to keep it burning smoothly. It is easy to avoid \n=\r\nsmoke. But, \n&gt; once you are done, the &quot;end game&quot; will produce some smoke.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Instead of putting a whole or half coconut, put small dry coconut \npiec=\r\nes. \n&gt; For example, if I put two 1.5&quot;x1.5&quot; pieces of dry coconut, they \nbur=\r\nn easily \n&gt; for 40 minutes. It is a good idea to start off with two or more=\r\n \npieces, so \n&gt; that one can help re-bring the fire in the other one if it =\r\ngoes \naway. After \n&gt; the fire is fully established, it is stable. In the be=\r\nginning, when \na piece \n&gt; just catches fire, the fire can go away. If there=\r\n are two pieces, \nthey can \n&gt; help each other (just as two spiritual aspira=\r\nnts can help each \nother in the \n&gt; beginning if one of them is wavering).\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From:=\r\n &quot;kumar_gh_2000&quot; &lt;kumar_gh_2000@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: Wednesday, August 29, 2007 1:47 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gan=\r\napati Havan/Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha ji,\n&gt; &gt; Thank you very much for =\r\nreply.

However, compared to fire \nin\n&gt; &gt; regula=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam, fire in a deepa homam is restricted and unfree. Thus, a\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\negular homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is far more effective than a deepa homam.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But, =\r\nif you have no better choice, it can certainly be \nconsidered.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So=\r\nme people living in apartments in USA have performed\n&gt; &gt; Mahaganapathi homa=\r\nm,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but I am not that familiar with UK.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you use dry coconu=\r\nt pieces only (i.e. no wood) and put the \nright\n&gt; &gt; amount\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of ghee, it=\r\n actually generates hardly any smoke. However, that\n&gt; &gt; takes a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; little=\r\n bit of practice. Doing the homam near a window and keeping\n&gt; &gt; the window\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; open can also help.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There is a smoke detector right next to =\r\nthe door (which is always\n&gt; &gt; kept open)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the room in which I do my =\r\ndaily homam at my house. It goes off\n&gt; &gt; very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rarely.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If Gan=\r\napathi wants you to worship Him in fire, He will show you \nthe\n&gt; &gt; way.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----=\r\n Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sharat&quot; &lt;gidoc@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, August 19, 2007 7:32 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Ganapati Havan/Homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ||Namah Shivaya||\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narsimha ji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I follow your teachings and =\r\nlessons very closely and have been\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reflecting on beginning the Ganap=\r\nati havan as per your teching \nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; illustrations.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However I l=\r\nive in a modern apartment in UK,with fire/smoke \nalrams;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have no per=\r\nsonal open ground or balcony.
