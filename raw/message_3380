Please do not think that your m=\r\nantra is not working because it is cursed and that it will magically work i=\r\nf you chant the shaapa vimochana mantra (curse relieving incantation).\n=A0\n=\r\nTake Savitru Gayatri mantra for example. It extolls the effulgence of the C=\r\nosmic Sun who lights up the Sushumna nadi (subtle channel of realization). =\r\nThe chhandas Gayatri is the shakti controlling the entrance of Sushumna nad=\r\ni in Mooladhaara chakra. Repeated chanting of Gayatri mantra with focus wil=\r\nl open the entrance of Sushumna nadi and let self-awareness (Kundalini) flo=\r\nw in the channel of realization. The ultimate goal is self-realization.\n=A0=\r\n\nHowever, if one does not realize the goal and thinks in terms of a limited=\r\n I-ness and its desires (good health, wealth, children, fame etc etc) even =\r\nas one chants Gayatri mantra, one will not achieve self-realization. One&#39;s =\r\nKundalini may rise, but will stop somewhere. One is blocked from the &quot;full =\r\nresults&quot; of Gayatri mantra. THAT is what is meant by it being cursed.\n=A0\nG=\r\nayatri mantra has three curses. Take the one from Vasishtha for example. Th=\r\ne word Vaishtha comes from vasu and means &quot;the purest and the most excellen=\r\nt one&quot;. If an impure one, i.e. one with desires of a limited I-ness, is cha=\r\nnting it, there is a curse from Vasishtha that blocks one. If you see the s=\r\nhaapavimochana mantra given in tradition for Vasishtha&#39;s curse, you will se=\r\ne that it says &quot;I am the light that fills the entire universe, I am Shiva e=\r\ntc&quot;. It implores sadhaka to let the limited I-ness go.\n=A0\nIf one merely ch=\r\nants that shaapa vimochana mantra, it is akin to chanting &quot;Advil stops head=\r\nache&quot;. Chanting that does not stop headache. One needs to actually take Adv=\r\nil. Similarly, one needs to imbibe the meanings of the shaapa vimochana man=\r\ntras, in order for the Veda mantra of Gayatri to work fully and make one se=\r\nlf-realized.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBottom=\r\nline: Stories of curses and curse relieving incantations for various deitie=\r\ns and mantras are metaphorical in nature. Instead of searching for a magica=\r\nl formula, one should work on one&#39;s mental attitude and thinking. Surrender=\r\n to god and consider all actions as offerings to god. Do whatever sadhana y=\r\nou can, whether it is japam or homam, for whatever time you can. In the res=\r\nt of the time, keep a close watch on your thinking and eliminate undesirabl=\r\ne thoughts (thoughts emanating from the desires of a limited I-ness) at the=\r\n root. Expand I-ness to include others - wife and children, parents, family=\r\n, friends, community, country, world etc. Rooting out of conditioning thoug=\r\nh constant contemplation enables one to do a better japam or homam. The tim=\r\ne spent in japam and homam enables one to contemplate better and eliminate =\r\nconditioning faster. The external sadhanas and the internal contemplation a=\r\nid each other.\n=A0\nWhen one&#39;s attitude is pure, all mantras become possible=\r\n.
