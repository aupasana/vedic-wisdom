How ever, I have few observation=\r\ns regarding the analogies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. In all the anlogies, we know what it=\r\n feels like when we reach the goal. We know what it is like to have a Job. =\r\nWe know what it is like to reach the bank. We also know how made not reachi=\r\nng the goal. No job, typically means no money and results normally in miser=\r\ny. No reaching sea bank normally means death out of starvation. But, the sa=\r\nme is not the case with spiritual jouney.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of us do not know w=\r\nhat it is to see God. After all, if I finally realise and God and merge, th=\r\nere is no more happyness/sadness. It is supposed to be a state of Nirguna. =\r\nAlso, we hear so much that we should strive to treat happyness/saddness, pr=\r\naise/disgrace equally. If one can react to sadness as one do to happyness, =\r\nthere is no further problem. God or no God, such a state is definitely good=\r\n to be in. But, this also means, I do not enjoy happyness. What is the diff=\r\nerence between an non living being and me in such a case?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. In se=\r\na, when you have to row a long distance to reach a bank, you have limited e=\r\nnergy left with you. So, the key is not to loose hope and courageand reeval=\r\nuate the strategy to reach the bank faster. At times, it may be best to sle=\r\nep that row against wind. The key to to get maximum return for the energy y=\r\nou spend since you have limited energy left with you. It depends how close =\r\nyou are from bank. If I can see bank, then perhaps rowing with my full stre=\r\nngth may be a good idea, but, if I know for sure, I am very far from bank, =\r\nI am bettere off letting wind take me some where and concentrate on surving=\r\n for longer - I may use my strength to find some food for me than rowing an=\r\nd weaking myself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Vijay\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajesh=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me change the track from homam to material things, in o=\r\nrder to address the &quot;god decides everything&quot; notion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What i=\r\n am trying to ask you here is..

Happiness, sorrows, success, failure ever=\r\nything about me and my family is decided by god in advance. It is like a fi=\r\nlm. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will happen to my famil=\r\ny. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we will get. Will my going=\r\n to work or not going to work change things?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, one d=\r\noes not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard to find=\r\n a new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened to the logic=\r\n that &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Well, from one reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But=\r\n you, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to that =\r\nreference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you=\r\n can engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to =\r\nthose actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very imp=\r\nortant and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have perform=\r\ned an action or skipped an action only because god had already decided so. =\r\nBut you do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, don&#39;t =\r\nyou? In the previous example where one lost a job, won&#39;t one look for a new=\r\n job?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a jo=\r\nb, sit at home and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one wil=\r\nl not look for a job, sit at home and yet something will happen and family =\r\nwill do fine. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, but not=\r\n get a job and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will lo=\r\nok for a job, get a job and family will do fine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is absolu=\r\ntely true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you d=\r\no not know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. family not=\r\n suffering) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you k=\r\nnow in your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you u=\r\nse your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order=\r\n to achieve the desired outcome. However, given that you don&#39;t know what go=\r\nd willed and what will happen, you cannot convince yourself that your desir=\r\ned outcome WILL happen. So do not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you =\r\ncan and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose you are trying to sail your bo=\r\nat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a really heavy wind is blowing. You can =\r\nleave it to the wind to take you there or you can row the boat actively. As=\r\n wind changes your course, you constantly re-evaluate how you should row an=\r\nd row the boat in such a way that you finally reach the bank. Because wind =\r\nis so heavy and sometimes overcomes your rowing, you cannot say that your r=\r\nowing is not needed. If you do not row well, wind may keep you going in cir=\r\ncles within the ocean and you may not reach the bank. You keep doing your b=\r\nest to row in the correct direction. If wind took you in a wrong direction,=\r\n you do not stop rowing and start crying. Then wind may push you further in=\r\n a wrong direction! Irrespective of the outcome, the best strategy is to ke=\r\nep re-evaluating how to row and keep rowing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you start row=\r\ning harder than before and yet wind is also blowing harder than before and =\r\nyou are not making progress, do not stop rowing. If you do, you may go back=\r\n further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind does not blow the same way always=\r\n!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come when your rowing will be produc=\r\ntive. A time may also come when wind pushes you in the correct direction. S=\r\no, just row row row your boat...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ponder on this metaphor a li=\r\nttle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same logic that a=\r\npplies to looking for a job above applies to doing homam and other spiritua=\r\nl sadhana. Do they change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same way looki=\r\nng for a job actively when you are out of one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps g=\r\nod has decided that one will not do sadhana and one will be stuck without a=\r\nny progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet s=\r\nomething will happen and one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided th=\r\nat one will do sadhana, but not make much progress in the next few years or=\r\n lives. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana and make good prog=\r\nress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is absolutely true that whichever of the above god w=\r\nilled will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a =\r\ndesired outcome (e.g. spiritual progress) and want to maximize the chance (=\r\ncalculated based on what you know in your reference frame) that your desire=\r\nd outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to figure=\r\n out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. Do the best =\r\nyou can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as searching for a job is a good strategy in general for one wi=\r\nthout a job and wanting family not to suffer, doing spiritual sadhana such =\r\nas homam and japam is a good strategy in general for one wanting to make sp=\r\niritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to=\r\n emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up family and their=\r\n welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma you are doing now,=\r\n but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachment to a result =\r\ndoes not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety regarding whethe=\r\nr the desired result will happen or not will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop =\r\none from operating at one&#39;s best. Decide your actions based on a desired ou=\r\ntcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may not be achieved=\r\n even though your actions seem at this point of time to be the best possibl=\r\ne actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such a karm=\r\na yogi is always doing the best possible actions and wasting very little ti=\r\nme on worrying about things not in one&#39;s control. It is a very effective st=\r\nrategy materially as well as spiritually!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requir=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sacrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures ? Can&#39;t we ha=\r\nve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress and material success can =\r\nco-exist. But spiritual progress and attachment to (and worrying about) mat=\r\nerial success tend to pull one in different directions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do no=\r\nt see world as a place where you seek pleasures or enjoyments, but see it m=\r\nainly as a place where you *give* enjoyment to others. Focus on giving. You=\r\n may also *receive* pleasures in the bargain, but do not strive for it or c=\r\nalculate it or focus your mind on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you give now is in=\r\n your hands. What you get now is in god&#39;s hands and is decided based on wha=\r\nt you gave earlier. What you give now decides what you will receive later. =\r\nSpiritual progress essentially means realizing this and focusing the mind, =\r\nits thoughts and actions on giving to the world, rather than receiving. Eve=\r\nn as you focus your mind on giving, you will also receive some things. But =\r\nexactly what they are is based on what you gave in the past, which is water=\r\n under the bridge, and hence you have no control over it now. This is true =\r\nirrespective of whether you are attached to what you receive or not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just keep doing sadhana. My feeli=\r\nng is that you are one of the people who will make very good progress in co=\r\nming years. Rome is not built in a day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My intuition strongly=\r\n tells me that Vishnu homam is the best for you. If you want, you can keep =\r\ndoing occasional Chandi homam like you are doing now. But why don&#39;t you con=\r\nsider replacing the daily Ganapathi homam with Vishnu homam?
