In fact, the priests I talk to tell me homa=\r\nm is done in loha kund, showing some gate or barricade to the temple, etc. =\r\nWhile I am not sure who is right, I decided to buy a copper havan kund and =\r\nwill be glad to know if there are any online sites that can sell havan kund=\r\n of as big size as I expect to buy as the present loha kund I use is big in=\r\n size.\n\nTypically what is the size to buy if one has to do a big homam ? Al=\r\nso, when I see the specifications on the sites, I guess they mention the ou=\r\nter square, and I am looking at at least 6 inches X 6 inches bottom, that m=\r\nay mean 10 x 10 probably ! \n\nregards\nrAma\n\n\n"}}
