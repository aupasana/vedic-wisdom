However, eventually the smell =\r\nwill be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends on how strong the smel=\r\nl was when the stick was burnt.\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, when a great saint medita=\r\ntes in a place, the air there will be filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual en=\r\nergy. Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, th=\r\nat energy will linger there. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nIn many famous temples these days, priests have become commercial and do no=\r\nt have the devotion needed. The rituals performed every few years to re-ene=\r\nrgize the idols \n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIt is my humble opinion that =\r\nsome famous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not=\r\n want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples =\r\nseem to have a powerful divine presence.\n=C2=A0\nI was very impressed with t=\r\nhe=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hil=\r\nls in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s pl=\r\nace). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. The=\r\nre are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, ev=\r\nen 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshine=\r\nshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat =\r\ntemple which is also in Calcutta.\n=C2=A0\nThere was one small temple in Tami=\r\nl Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temple=\r\ns all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 20=\r\n06. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. =\r\nThe name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tam=\r\nil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the na=\r\nme now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in=\r\n front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whos=\r\ne face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence=\r\n there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the godde=\r\nss, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a r=\r\noof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident=\r\n each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no =\r\nroof. Though we spent only 5 min and left\n in a hurry, I was very pleased w=\r\nith that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the tem=\r\nple and goddess.\n=C2=A0\nLike this, I am sure there are many temples with a =\r\npowerful divine presence across India.\n=C2=A0\nApart from the Kaali temple a=\r\nt Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Kris=\r\nhna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj =\r\nis still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n=C2=A0\nEven the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating t=\r\nhan a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and t=\r\namas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa the=\r\nre. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view=\r\n is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are rea=\r\nlly good.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual =\r\nsadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n=C2=A0\nMayapur, Dakshineshw=\r\nar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam=\r\n hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, S=\r\nhirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India,=\r\n Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantra=\r\nlayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n=C2=A0\nThere are many other good pl=\r\naces, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing an=\r\nd staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and=\r\n doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nF=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nJyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: As=\r\ntro Seeker \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nSent: Wednesday, October 07=\r\n, 2009 9:11 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n\n\n\n\n\nRespected Narsimhaj=\r\ni, \n\n\nI would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc)=\r\n in today&#39;s time.

There is a tremendous amoun=\r\nt of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the =\r\nidol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get t=\r\nhe same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I wa=\r\ns taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil=\r\n Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never hear=\r\nd of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the&=\r\nnbsp;form of the divine Mother&nbsp;present there was a Tamil language name=\r\n and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, whe=\r\nn I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the id=\r\nol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiti=\r\nng rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortun=\r\nately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a =\r\ntemple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the god=\r\ndess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and t=\r\nhey finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.\n Though we=\r\n spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple.=\r\n Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a=\r\n powerful divine presence across India.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Apart from =\r\nthe Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditati=\r\nng was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune.

Thus, any temple in =\r\nIndia will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not mu=\r\nch left at *some* temples.
