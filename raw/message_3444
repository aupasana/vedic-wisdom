You are lucky to have =\r\nspent time with Manish in the blessed city of Kashi and that too at the ble=\r\nssed Manikarnika ghat.\n=A0\nThere is something about Manish and dogs. Even w=\r\nhen we two were doing a Chandi homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008=\r\n, a similar thing happened. A pack of 7-8 dogs living on that hill came and=\r\n sat around the homam to watch. They were calm for the entire homam (a coup=\r\nle of hours) and watched it. When bali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was o=\r\nffered at the end, they all got up together and ran in one direction barkin=\r\ng and jumping up. It was as though they were trying to chase someone.\n=A0\nS=\r\nome say that several animals, especially dogs, have subtle extra-sensory pe=\r\nrception that is superior to that of humans.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThat homam is still fresh in my mind. When we w=\r\nere climbing that hill in the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish told me=\r\n, &quot;we have a strong connection with this place. Something will happen here =\r\ntoday.&quot; When we discovered two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorak=\r\nshanath) living there, we talked to them for a while. Manish saw their homa=\r\n kundam there and asked, &quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it in yo=\r\nur homa kundam tonight?&quot; The person said, &quot;we are worshippers of Narayana a=\r\nnd do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any taamasik practices =\r\nresorted to.&quot; We told him we would call Mahalakshmi in fire and there would=\r\n be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.\n=A0\nWe left and reached the h=\r\nill with materials around 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings were pitch=\r\n dark and silent. There was no electricity in that area. We climbed the hil=\r\nl using Manish&#39;s cell phone backlight to show the way. There were several d=\r\nogs there and they started barking when they saw us climbing. But when we s=\r\ntarted the homam, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An o=\r\nld sadhu also came out of the hut and sat near the fire.\n=A0\nThe moment The=\r\n Mother was invoked in fire, the whole place that was silent till then exce=\r\npt for our chants suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a=\r\n valley in the eastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from thei=\r\nr trees in that area and started making loud sounds. The whole area resound=\r\ned with the sounds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this=\r\n huge commotion felt quite eerie.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhile on the topic of that trip, I can mention something pe=\r\nrsonal that demonstrates how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakris=\r\nhna in the story sent by Prasanth today.\n=A0\nDuring that trip in the Indian=\r\n summer of 2008, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies =\r\nin front of several people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Mah=\r\naraj was talking about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topi=\r\nc and mention great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of peo=\r\nple, I was first unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to fee=\r\nl special.\n=A0\nOn the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manis=\r\nh relaxed his rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire wh=\r\nen doing homam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam=\r\n and Manish would do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last =\r\nminute and said we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was=\r\n ready and could share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an &quot;ack=\r\nnowledgment&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already provoked pride peaked w=\r\nith this.\n=A0\nMy mind was filled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra=\r\n and deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night&#39;s homam. Ma=\r\nnish said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back, he sco=\r\nlded me with a very stern and serious tone, &quot;what were you thinking? We cal=\r\nled the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a great oppor=\r\ntunity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mother of th=\r\ne universe. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her presen=\r\nce? Had I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old times, you=\r\n would&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He was in that serious mood for an hour or so=\r\n and then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, &quot;are you st=\r\nill thinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Everything =\r\nhappens for good. I have no doubt you will overcome. Time has to come for a=\r\nnything. Don&#39;t worry and keep doing sadhana.&quot;\n=A0\nI realized that day that =\r\nMahaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience and irres=\r\npective of how much progress you make, she can delude you in a split second=\r\n. In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one makes is not really=\r\n one&#39;s. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The moment one thinks=\r\n &quot;I, so-and-so individual, exist&quot; and attributes those &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;p=\r\nrogress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is instantly bound - there is scope for pride, ha=\r\nppiness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the =\r\nsupreme power running the universe, while performing the duties that one is=\r\n inspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY=\r\n attention to ANY results that come, including praises and criticism, is th=\r\ne only solution.\n=A0\nThis experience taught me a very valuable lesson. What=\r\n Manish said about me to others in my presence may have been a way of testi=\r\nng me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does not =\r\nmatter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *temporar=\r\ny* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one&#39;s dharma. Attributes of that p=\r\nersona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The momen=\r\nt one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and forms an attachment to the attribute=\r\ns of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use that person=\r\na to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An attachment to a perso=\r\nna brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds one, irrespective of=\r\n how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, everything that is=\r\n temporary perishes.\n=A0\nAlso, note that pride can strike anytime anywhere,=\r\n as long as one has an attachment to the persona. Keep doing sadhana, while=\r\n constantly contemplating and guarding against such an attachment. Pride is=\r\n suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppressed again, comes back =\r\nagain and so on. This cycle goes on until one&#39;s attachment to the persona i=\r\ns killed completely. This is a long process. Don&#39;t worry too much and just =\r\nkeep doing sadhana.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0=\r\n\nThe thing about the hungry kid reminds me of something. When Manish and I =\r\nwere climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog that was walking on =\r\n3 legs started following us. It came with us a long way. At one point, it r=\r\nan ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather stair-side) stall =\r\nthat was still open. Manish stopped there, bought some biscuit packets and =\r\nfed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us then. In a couple of min=\r\nutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy clothes. He was weeping. Manish s=\r\ntopped and asked him what happened. He said he lost all his money at a hote=\r\nl in Junagadh and has no money to even buy food. He decided to just climb t=\r\nhe hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattatreya and leave it to him to =\r\nhelp him out. He was climbing up, while we were climbing down. It was getti=\r\nng nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of money, all the biscuit packet=\r\ns that were with us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave back a few\n biscu=\r\nit pieces to me and said, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;\n=A0\nLater Manish told me th=\r\ne same thing he told you, &quot;you never know when and in what form god comes t=\r\no test you. Kindness and compassion towards needy people is an important dh=\r\narma.&quot;\n=A0\nOne does not need to do something beyond one&#39;s means. But, one c=\r\nan have compassion, feel the other person&#39;s pain and help within one&#39;s mean=\r\ns.\n=A0\nI considered the biscuit pieces given back by that old man as Dattat=\r\nreya&#39;s prasad and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, please note that Vat=\r\nuka Bhairava is depicted as a child.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBTW, the Girnar trip happenened unplanned. We were suppo=\r\nsed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shooting for the Krishna movie. But w=\r\ne basically finished what we had intended. So I was thinking in my mind wit=\r\nh dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want to prolong things here and shoot m=\r\nore? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just leave Dwaraka and perhaps go to Gi=\r\nrnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to myself. It was late in the evening a=\r\nnd we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka. All of a sudden, Manish=\r\n told the driver to stop and turn back to the hotel. He announced that we w=\r\nere leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa aa gaya. hum Girnar jaayenge&quot; (inv=\r\nitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.) We rushed to the hotel, packed =\r\nand left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar around midnight and spent the nex=\r\nt day there. For those who do not know, Girnar is considered the abode of L=\r\nord Dattatreya.\n=A0\nSometimes, Manish has the uncanny ability to respond to=\r\n one&#39;s thoughts. However, he says it is not his ability, but it is Nature l=\r\nistening to one&#39;s wish and fulfilling through another.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nImagine chess pieces being moved by an =\r\nexpert player thinking &quot;I am an powerful king. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a beautif=\r\nul queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a strong knight. I am great&quot;, &quot;I killed a grea=\r\nt bishop despite being a pawn. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am just a pawn, but I sacrif=\r\niced myself to trap the queen. I am great&quot; etc.\n=A0\nIt may sound weird, but=\r\n this is what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people a=\r\nre pieces in another kind of chess game. Not realizing that a player is mov=\r\ning us, we engage in egoistic thoughts, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake =\r\npride, fake shame etc. One is free from all those fake feelings if one real=\r\nizes this. Of course, that does not mean inaction. The inspiration that com=\r\nes in us to engage in various actions in the world is like the hand of the =\r\nplayer moving the piece. We should respect that engage in actions, but not =\r\nsee them as our actions.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n=A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings\n------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n=A0\n--- On Thu, 1/14/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@....=\r\nin&gt; wrote:\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Rama Naama Satya Hai - 1\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thurs=\r\nday, January 14, 2010, 6:56 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      =\r\nDear Narasimha and others,\n=A0\nRajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Vara=\r\nnasi with Manish. I see that your signature changed after the trip.\n=A0\nWe =\r\nhad a remarkable time at Varanasi. \n=A0\nThe moment our flight landed at the=\r\n Kashi airport which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Mani=\r\nsh said there is something in here which is different. The energy is palpab=\r\nle throughout. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming =\r\naround the ghats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n=A0\nBy 9 P=\r\nM Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan,=\r\n on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many grea=\r\nt sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to pe=\r\nrform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=\r\n=A0spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=A0The =\r\neffect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for =\r\nthose who have such inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire=\r\n of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike t=\r\nhe fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and man=\r\ny in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not=\r\n to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a fune=\r\nral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not trying anything in =\r\nsuch a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\n Mahakala and Mahakal=\r\ni. \n=A0\n=A0We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of=\r\n=A0full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =A0kismis, havan samag=\r\nri. While buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath =\r\ntemple, suddenly a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There =\r\nwas a sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop aski=\r\nng for food. Manish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the chil=\r\nd. The child was eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we =\r\nwere buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child=\r\n, I turned round and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was=\r\n no child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very cl=\r\nearly. Manish smiled and said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whet=\r\nher we=A0had become so big sadhakas that we=A0are unable to feed a hungry c=\r\nhild=A0. That is how God comes to test people.=A0Kya\n pata Narayan kab, kah=\r\na aur=A0kis roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n=A0\nAt 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed=\r\n in a combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the =\r\nsamshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people=\r\n who work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at l=\r\neast 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges,=\r\n pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease ou=\r\nt a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to=\r\n react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of=\r\n curiosity=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes=\r\n and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous en=\r\nergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi=\r\n. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too tu=\r\nrned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs i=\r\nn the\n samshan went running=A0to that direction.\n=A0\nAfter waiting like thi=\r\ns for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major=\r\n portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some=\r\n time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offer=\r\ning was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sy=\r\nnc with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to =\r\nthe ambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were up=\r\nto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre =\r\nto light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, takin=\r\ng pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to h=\r\nim not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb =\r\nthat pyre again. \n=A0\nVery soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack =\r\nof 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was=\r\n being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, f=\r\nrom all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it=\r\n tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching =\r\nus or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Ver=\r\ny nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron=\r\n and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind a=\r\nway to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally=A0a=\r\nccustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from the pa=\r\nck which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish=\r\n. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in an an=\r\ngular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is\n not an an=\r\nimal but a human being watching. Just staring and observing every action. M=\r\nanish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.\n=A0\nThe hom=\r\na finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as well as in be=\r\ntween, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a few notches abo=\r\nve the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n=A0\nSimply being in a samshan=\r\n and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind.=\r\n In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Bo=\r\nth the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this k=\r\nind of a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very=\r\n sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling=\r\n of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more rea=\r\nl and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish =\r\nas they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.\n=A0\nManish said if yo=\r\nur intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through =\r\nsadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of pe=\r\ntty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to =\r\nharm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb y=\r\nou because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi. I=\r\nt is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. There =\r\nare spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they bo=\r\nther you. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=A0attitude to have.

You are lucky to have spent time with Manish in the blesse=\r\nd city of Kashi and that too at the blessed Manikarnika ghat.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThere is something about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were doing a Cha=\r\nndi homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing happened.=\r\n A pack of 7-8 dogs living on that hill came and sat around the homam to wa=\r\ntch. They were calm for the entire homam (a couple of hours) and watched it=\r\n. When bali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at the end, they all=\r\n got up together and ran in one direction barking and jumping up. It was as=\r\n though they were trying to chase someone.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Some say that sever=\r\nal animals, especially dogs, have subtle extra-sensory perception that is s=\r\nuperior to that of\n humans.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;That h=\r\nomam is still fresh in my mind. When we were climbing that hill in the afte=\r\nrnoon to do some shooting, Manish told me, &quot;we have a strong connection wit=\r\nh this place. Something will happen here today.&quot; When we discovered two Nat=\r\nh path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorakshanath) living there, we talked t=\r\no them for a while. Manish saw their homa kundam there and asked, &quot;we do a =\r\nChandi homam everyday. Can we do it in your homa kundam tonight?&quot; The perso=\r\nn said, &quot;we are worshippers of Narayana and do not want any taamasik deitie=\r\ns to be called or any taamasik practices resorted to.&quot; We told him we would=\r\n call Mahalakshmi in fire and there would be no taamasik practices. Then he=\r\n consented.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We left and reached the hill with materials around=\r\n 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings were pitch dark and silent. There w=\r\nas no\n electricity in that area. We climbed the hill using Manish&#39;s cell ph=\r\none backlight to show the way. There were several dogs there and they start=\r\ned barking when they saw us climbing. But when we started the homam, dogs s=\r\ntopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu also came out o=\r\nf the hut and sat near the fire.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The moment The Mother was inv=\r\noked in fire, the whole place that was silent till then except for our chan=\r\nts suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a valley in the =\r\neastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from their trees in that=\r\n area and started making loud sounds. The whole area resounded with the sou=\r\nnds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this huge commotion=\r\n felt quite eerie.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;While on the to=\r\npic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demonstrates how\n p=\r\nride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story sent by Prasa=\r\nnth today.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;During that trip in the Indian summer of 2008, Mani=\r\nsh kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies in front of several p=\r\neople. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was talking abou=\r\nt Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mention great t=\r\nhings about me. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was first unaf=\r\nfected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;On the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxed hi=\r\ns rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire when doing hom=\r\nam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam and Manish =\r\nwould do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last minute and s=\r\naid we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was ready and c=\r\nould share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an\n &quot;acknowledgment=\r\n&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already provoked pride peaked with this.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;My mind was filled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra a=\r\nnd deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night&#39;s homam. Mani=\r\nsh said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back, he scold=\r\ned me with a very stern and serious tone, &quot;what were you thinking? We calle=\r\nd the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a great opportu=\r\nnity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mother of the =\r\nuniverse. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her presence=\r\n? Had I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old times, you w=\r\nould&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He was in that serious mood for an hour or so a=\r\nnd then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, &quot;are you stil=\r\nl thinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Everything ha=\r\nppens for good. I have no doubt you will overcome.\n Time has to come for an=\r\nything. Don&#39;t worry and keep doing sadhana.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I realized that d=\r\nay that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience a=\r\nnd irrespective of how much progress you make, she can delude you in a spli=\r\nt second. In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one makes is no=\r\nt really one&#39;s. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The moment on=\r\ne thinks &quot;I, so-and-so individual, exist&quot; and attributes those &quot;experiences=\r\n&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is instantly bound - there is scope for p=\r\nride, happiness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender=\r\n to the supreme power running the universe, while performing the duties tha=\r\nt one is inspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and without pa=\r\nying ANY attention to ANY results that come, including praises and criticis=\r\nm, is the only solution.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This experience taught me a very valu=\r\nable lesson. What Manish said about me to\n others in my presence may have b=\r\neen a way of testing me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either =\r\ncase, it does not matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on ea=\r\nrth is a *temporary* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one&#39;s dharma. At=\r\ntributes of that persona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant=\r\n to one. The moment one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and forms an attachmen=\r\nt to the attributes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should ju=\r\nst use that persona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An att=\r\nachment to a persona brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds on=\r\ne, irrespective of how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, =\r\neverything that is temporary perishes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Also, note that pride c=\r\nan strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has an attachment to the persona=\r\n. Keep doing sadhana, while constantly contemplating and guarding against s=\r\nuch an attachment. Pride is\n suppressed for a while, comes back again, is s=\r\nuppressed again, comes back again and so on. This cycle goes on until one&#39;s=\r\n attachment to the persona is killed completely. This is a long process. Do=\r\nn&#39;t worry too much and just keep doing sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of something. When =\r\nManish and I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog that wa=\r\ns walking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a long way. At on=\r\ne point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather stair=\r\n-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, bought some biscuit=\r\n packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us then. In a =\r\ncouple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy clothes. He was weep=\r\ning. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He said he lost all his mo=\r\nney at a hotel in\n Junagadh and has no money to even buy food. He decided t=\r\no just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattatreya and leave=\r\n it to him to help him out. He was climbing up, while we were climbing down=\r\n. It was getting nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of money, all the =\r\nbiscuit packets that were with us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave bac=\r\nk a few biscuit pieces to me and said, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;L=\r\nater Manish told me the same thing he told you, &quot;you never know when and in=\r\n what form god comes to test you. Kindness and compassion towards needy peo=\r\nple is an important dharma.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One does not need to do something=\r\n beyond one&#39;s means. But, one can have compassion, feel the other person&#39;s =\r\npain and help within one&#39;s means.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I considered the biscuit pie=\r\nces given back by that old man as Dattatreya&#39;s prasad and ate it. Regarding=\r\n the child you saw, please note that Vatuka Bhairava is depicted as a\n chil=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;BTW, the Girnar trip happenened=\r\n unplanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shooting for=\r\n the Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended. So I wa=\r\ns thinking in my mind with dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want to prolon=\r\ng things here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just leave Dwa=\r\nraka and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to myself. It =\r\nwas late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka=\r\n. All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to the hote=\r\nl. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa aa gaya. =\r\nhum Girnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.) We rus=\r\nhed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar around m=\r\nidnight and spent the next day there. For those who do not\n know, Girnar is=\r\n considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, Manish ha=\r\ns the uncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s thoughts. However, he says it is =\r\nnot his ability, but it is Nature listening to one&#39;s wish and fulfilling th=\r\nrough another.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Imagine chess piece=\r\ns being moved by an expert player thinking &quot;I am an powerful king. I am gre=\r\nat&quot;, &quot;I am a beautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a strong knight. I am grea=\r\nt&quot;, &quot;I killed a great bishop despite being a pawn. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am just =\r\na pawn, but I sacrificed myself to trap the queen. I am great&quot; etc.&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life all the tim=\r\ne. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess game. Not r=\r\nealizing that a player is moving us, we engage in egoistic thoughts, fake h=\r\nappiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake shame etc.\n One is free from all t=\r\nhose fake feelings if one realizes this. Of course, that does not mean inac=\r\ntion. The inspiration that comes in us to engage in various actions in the =\r\nworld is like the hand of the player moving the piece. We should respect th=\r\nat engage in actions, but not see them as our actions.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best re=\r\ngards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Thu, 1/14/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;i&gt;&lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: =\r\n2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: raj=\r\narshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama =\r\nNaama Satya Hai - 1&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Thursday, =\r\nJanuary 14, 2010, 6:56 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1604961683&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n   =\r\n   \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody=\r\n&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: =\r\ninherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; fo=\r\nnt-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; -x-system-font: none;&quot; vali=\r\ngn=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dear Narasimha and others,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em=\r\n&gt;Rajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I see that y=\r\nour signature changed after the trip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;We had a remarkable time at Varanasi. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;T=\r\nhe moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actually quite ou=\r\ntside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something in here which =\r\nis different. The energy is palpable throughout. After checking in at the h=\r\notel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watching the evening Ga=\r\nnga Arati and shooting.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;By 9 PM Manish decided=\r\n on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan, on a funeral py=\r\nre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many great sadhakas in Hi=\r\nnduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various sa=\r\ndhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -&nbsp;spent most o=\r\nf his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.&nbsp;The effect that =\r\na Samshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for those who ha=\r\nve such inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funera=\r\nl pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of a=\r\n standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and many in number,=\r\n who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not to make a d=\r\nistinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a funeral pyre is =\r\n&quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not trying anything in such a fire.=\r\n The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\n Mahakala and Mahakali. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;We went to buy some samagri - til (black and whi=\r\nte), couple of&nbsp;full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), &nbsp=\r\n;kismis, havan samagri. While buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane =\r\nnear the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small begger child came and kept ask=\r\ning for food. There was a sweet shop on the other side of the lane, he poin=\r\nted to the shop asking for food. Manish turned around, bought some food and=\r\n gave it to the child. The child was eating when we turned back towards the=\r\n shop from where we were buying the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to=\r\n check for the child, I turned round and found no one there. I looked in th=\r\ne lane and there was no child anywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still rememb=\r\ner the child very clearly. Manish smiled and said, &quot; The deity of this plac=\r\ne wanted to see whether we&nbsp;had become so big sadhakas that we&nbsp;are=\r\n unable to feed a hungry child&nbsp;. That is how God comes to test people.=\r\n&nbsp;Kya\n pata Narayan kab, kaha aur&nbsp;kis roop me mil jaye.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in a combinati=\r\non of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the samshan at arou=\r\nnd eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with&nbsp;domes (people who work th=\r\nere to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at least 8 to 10=\r\n pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pitch black=\r\n at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease out a bit, not=\r\n sure when that will happen, not sure&nbsp;how people are going to react. A=\r\ns we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of curiosit=\r\ny&nbsp;and possible&nbsp;apprehension.&nbsp;Suddenly Manish closed his eyes=\r\n and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous en=\r\nergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi=\r\n. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too tu=\r\nrned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs i=\r\nn the\n samshan went running&nbsp;to that direction.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;After waiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the =\r\nrelatives had left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there was =\r\nenough left to last for some time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish=\r\n started the homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him doing the Cha=\r\nndi path, trying to be in sync with his recital. A part of my mind was also=\r\n trying to adjust itself to the ambience. There were quite a few people aro=\r\nund watching what we were upto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come =\r\nand take wood from the pyre to light other pyres. He did it in the most cau=\r\ntious manner possible, taking pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After som=\r\ne time Manish indicated to him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded h=\r\nis head and did not disturb that pyre again. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\nVery soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had come a=\r\nnd were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was being done. As&nbsp;I=\r\n&nbsp;read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, from all sides. A=\r\ns if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping it tight. The conc=\r\nentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was watching us or anything e=\r\nlse around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Very nice meditatio=\r\nn happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron and there&nbsp;=\r\nwas a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind away to some d=\r\nistant place, far, far away from the reality I am normally&nbsp;accustomed =\r\nto.&nbsp;While the homa was on, suddenly&nbsp;one black dog from the pack w=\r\nhich was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish. Fo=\r\nr I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in an angula=\r\nr fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is\n not an animal=\r\n but a human being watching. Just staring and observing every action. Manis=\r\nh said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the=\r\n end as well as in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pul=\r\nled a few notches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Simply being in a samshan and observing the human body=\r\n burning up has a powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the =\r\nfemur bones of a female human body burning. Both the femurs were visible an=\r\nd spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a w=\r\noman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very sexual connotation. In Manik=\r\narnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually the body i=\r\ns merely a covering for something far more real and powerful that resides i=\r\nnside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are ment to perish. O=\r\nnly Rama naam satya hai.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Manish said if your i=\r\nntentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to please God through sadh=\r\nanas&nbsp;- i.e you are not planning something negative nor desirous of pet=\r\nty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you will ever come to h=\r\narm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb yo=\r\nu because no one wants to mess with&nbsp;someone who is worshipping Chandi.=\r\n It is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessarily scared of. Ther=\r\ne are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother them nor will they =\r\nbother you. &nbsp;Surrendering to the deity is very good&nbsp;attitude to h=\r\nave. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the homa is bein=\r\ng done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning=\r\n pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did homa=\r\ns at Manikarnik. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Ra=\r\njarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;...to be continued...&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy=\r\n; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Courier=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/stro=\r\nng&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-638621250-1263504606=:47997--\r\n\n"}}
