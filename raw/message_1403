How can i  \n&gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; That then is the=\r\n experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; When the sadhak&#39;s person=\r\nality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s  \n&gt; personality sits there then the =\r\nsadhak experiences himself as that  \n&gt; Deity(Devata).\n&gt; There then arises n=\r\no difference in the sadhak or the deity  \n&gt; commanding a certain thing to h=\r\nappen( be it what appears to be good  \n&gt; or be it that which appears to be =\r\nbad) . The deity&#39;s personality is  \n&gt; crucial. Ugra devatas make the person=\r\n care almost for nothing  \n&gt; himself, so self identification is minimised a=\r\nnd the person&#39;s  \n&gt; spiritual evolution continues.\n&gt; Remember, there is ver=\r\ny little according to me which is black magic.  \n&gt; It is all a use of Shakt=\r\ni. If your Shakti and deity is a higher  \n&gt; shakti such as Prachand Chandik=\r\na, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then  \n&gt; your power will be that of God him=\r\nself( Provided you have Vijnana).  \n&gt; After the death of the body, such a s=\r\nadhaka joins the realm of the  \n&gt; deity or if he was originally a Nath or a=\r\n Muni goes to a separate  \n&gt; realm reserved for these beings.\n&gt; Attacking s=\r\nuch a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the  \n&gt; heads of the att=\r\nackers and some people may realise this to their  \n&gt; detriment( Patan comes=\r\n from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan  \n&gt; with his Shakti causing =\r\nan earthquake). Some people may even equate  \n&gt; this with black magic. Here=\r\n there is only action and reaction.(Bit  \n&gt; like you attack a normal person=\r\n, and you will get a result of this  \n&gt; from that same Atma whom you harmed=\r\n maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later.  \n&gt; But if you attack somebody who is ident=\r\nifying with the universe and  \n&gt; has very few karmas left, then the Univers=\r\ne itself attacks you,  \n&gt; because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on=\r\n his  \n&gt; identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; If people persist in us=\r\ning the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,  \n&gt; Bhuta, then there is only a=\r\n little Shakti which can be used,  \n&gt; moreover then their minds and intelle=\r\ncts will not be free of  \n&gt; identification with the body and so their actio=\r\nns are those which  \n&gt; are generally termed as black magic. These people us=\r\nually join the  \n&gt; same spirits which they have been using after death, thi=\r\ns is not an  \n&gt; enjoyable experience.\n&gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping =\r\nChandika for a few lifetimes,  \n&gt; then even in this birth he or she is draw=\r\nn to that deity and such a  \n&gt; sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of =\r\na mantra(because of his  \n&gt; previous effort).\n&gt; On the other hand somebody =\r\ndoing this mantra only in this lifetime  \n&gt; may feel that the 64 things whi=\r\nch bind every mantra are crucial and  \n&gt; may not acheive in this lifetime.\n=\r\n&gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me  \n&gt; =\r\nsuggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some goo=\r\nd day, do 1000  \n&gt; reititions of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, bu=\r\nt the real  \n&gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; Same time e=\r\nvery day.\n&gt; Same place.\n&gt; Same materials.\n&gt; Same direction.\n&gt; As little mov=\r\nement as one can.\n&gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; C=\r\nomplete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the  \n&gt; body)=\r\n, reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, ma=\r\nke sure your bowels are empty  \n&gt; before you start.\n&gt; Continue this for 100=\r\n days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; See the difference in your per=\r\nsonality before and after.\n&gt; Long and short , what is important is that lif=\r\ne may be short, so do  \n&gt; some sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for a=\r\ns long as is  \n&gt; physically possible.\n&gt; I hope this clarifies some of the c=\r\noncepts which were being discussed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; manish\n&gt; Yo=\r\nu may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel  \n&gt; that=\r\n this is suitable.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R. Ra=\r\no  \n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; Dear Sanjay,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mantra Shastra is a very=\r\n detailed work and includes mantra dosha  \n&gt; etc.\n&gt; &gt; It is very scientific=\r\n and accurate. It takes a lifetime to master  \n&gt; this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some may be fasc=\r\ninated by the texture, color and volume of the chaff  \n&gt; and miss the grain=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most people who talk about mantra shastra focus on the chaff and not =\r\n \n&gt; on the grain.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You talk of begging God vs commanding God? Now wher=\r\ne did that come  \n&gt; from?\n&gt; &gt; How is it related to what is under discussion=\r\n. Perhaps I have  \n&gt; missed many\n&gt; &gt; mails and am not able to get the conte=\r\nxt. Trying to command God is\n&gt; &gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to sa=\r\ny the least. The  \n&gt; attitude should\n&gt; &gt; always be that of a beggar in fron=\r\nt of God. If anyone has said  \n&gt; otherwise, I\n&gt; &gt; also disagee with him/her=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; I mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of  \n&gt; ma=\r\nntras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and  \n&gt; wants=\r\n to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no  \n&gt; need for t=\r\nhousands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities.  \n&gt; These thousands=\r\n of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for  \n&gt; commanding thousands of =\r\ndifferent results from god. That is why I  \n&gt; talked of commanding vs beggi=\r\nng. However, this commanding works  \n&gt; slightly differently than one may im=\r\nagine. I will elaborate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Comma=\r\nnding low level beings  \n&gt; is black magic, which can be accomplished even b=\r\ny a person not quite  \n&gt; elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy eg=\r\no. However,  \n&gt; commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only for =\r\na  \n&gt; spiritually elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This  \n&gt; =\r\ncommanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In  \n&gt; fa=\r\nct, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in  \n&gt; completely=\r\n effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I  \n&gt; will repeat som=\r\nething from the previous mail to clarify:\n&gt;\n&gt; The universe has many lokas (=\r\nplanes of consciousness), many beings  \n&gt; and many objects. There are infin=\r\nite karmic interactions possible  \n&gt; between them. Accordingly, there are i=\r\nnfinite possible mantras. When  \n&gt; one is able to perfectly control the min=\r\nd and *fill it* with a  \n&gt; mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverber=\r\nating in the mind  \n&gt; constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This pe=\r\nrfect  \n&gt; absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal  =\r\n\n&gt; changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific  \n&gt; =\r\nto the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the  \n&gt; un=\r\niverse and corresponding karmic interactions between various  \n&gt; objects.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Each set of &quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is a  \n&gt; &quot;resu=\r\nlt&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term  \n&gt; merging se=\r\nlf-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific  \n&gt; result from it as=\r\n &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like  \n&gt; the term or not, it i=\r\ns essentially that.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; But the bottomline is this:=\r\n Only a highly purified sadhaka of very  \n&gt; low ego can command specific re=\r\nsults from god (not for selfishness  \n&gt; or even ego satisfaction, but actin=\r\ng as an unattached instrument of  \n&gt; Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by =\r\nNature). Various mantras and  \n&gt; technicalities of mantra shastra taught by=\r\n rishis are meant for such  \n&gt; sadhakas.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those are hardly of use to so =\r\nmany people out there with dense egos  \n&gt; seeking specific selfish results.=\r\n They cannot command specific  \n&gt; results from god (because of their heavy =\r\nattachment to the result,  \n&gt; which is in turn due to their own attachment =\r\nto a limited ego), even  \n&gt; if they use all the techniques of mantra shastr=\r\na and all the  \n&gt; associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their t=\r\nime with  \n&gt; these technicalities, they will be better off learning to be g=\r\nood  \n&gt; beggars at God&#39;s door.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mant=\r\nra you feel attracted to,  \n&gt; without worrying about so many technicalities=\r\n, and learn to be  \n&gt; humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for =\r\nhim to give you  \n&gt; what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and wheneve=\r\nr he gives.\n&gt;\n&gt; Keep praying every day or every second when you are able to=\r\n. Even  \n&gt; when you are not praying, remember him in all of your actions. W=\r\nhen  \n&gt; you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it is=\r\n  \n&gt; his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time,  \n&gt; =\r\nslowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing  \n&gt; of =\r\nattitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right  \n&gt; mantra=\r\n, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable  \n&gt; knowledg=\r\ne coming from questionable sources!).\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; There may=\r\n be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra) for  \n&gt; climbing it. Each p=\r\nath may lead to a different spot (different  \n&gt; experience) on the top and =\r\nshow a different scenery (result). Expert  \n&gt; advisors (astrologers) may te=\r\nll you to use a specific path (mantra)  \n&gt; to see a specific scenery (resul=\r\nt). But such advice is useless to a  \n&gt; handicapped person without legs (a =\r\nselfish person with dense ego).  \n&gt; It is relevant only to person with legs=\r\n and one who is strong and  \n&gt; sturdy, who can successfully climb the mount=\r\nain (a reasonably  \n&gt; detached person with very little ego).\n&gt;\n&gt; Even when =\r\nyou encounter a person who has legs and can actually climb  \n&gt; the mountain=\r\n, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and  \n&gt; traverse the lo=\r\nng path, rather than which path to take. The  \n&gt; astrologers who are bogged=\r\n down by all the technicalities and people  \n&gt; who take customized mantra a=\r\ndvice from astrologers and think that  \n&gt; they will get a result quickly by=\r\n doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are  \n&gt; missing the basic point. The power of=\r\n a powerful mantra is with  \n&gt; respect to the experience and result obtaine=\r\nd *after* one succeeds  \n&gt; with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra=\r\n is akin to a path  \n&gt; leading to a point atop the mountain where the view =\r\nshows a  \n&gt; particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you =\r\ndo  \n&gt; have to survive the climb along the long path.\n&gt;\n&gt; We need to emphas=\r\nize the attitude and approach needed for the long  \n&gt; climb, rather than em=\r\nphasizing the choice of the path based on  \n&gt; horoscope. It is worth noting=\r\n that so many great spiritual teachers  \n&gt; who came in the last century or =\r\ntwo did not emphasize picking the  \n&gt; right mantra based on horoscope etc. =\r\nInstead, they emphasized having  \n&gt; the correct attitude - surrender, submi=\r\nssion, devotion, patience,  \n&gt; persistence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *T=\r\nhat* is a lot more  \n&gt; important and useful than trying to be oversmart wit=\r\nh the choice of  \n&gt; mantra, day etc and impress god.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; when should the worship of a graha be done? Let us say someone\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this\n&gt; &gt; worship =\r\nshould be done?\n&gt;\n&gt; You can do anyday. Parasara does not mention any day fo=\r\nr doing homam  \n&gt; to a graha.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, if one wants, one can do a homam=\r\n or worship to Mars (or any  \n&gt; planet) every day. It is even better that w=\r\nay.\n&gt;\n&gt; If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is fine. But  \n=\r\n&gt; saying that doing it on so and so day will bring serious dangers  \n&gt; beca=\r\nuse Mars is an enemy of so and so planet would be stretching  \n&gt; things.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana)  \n&gt; =\r\ngot his\n&gt; &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did =\r\n \n&gt; they get it from?\n&gt;\n&gt; From Self - from within. That is the source of al=\r\nl knowledge. A  \n&gt; sadguru need not specifically teach thousand things, but=\r\n needs to  \n&gt; open the door inside.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OK, just =\r\nspell it out. What is the reason for Gandanta being in 0  \n&gt; deg,\n&gt; &gt; 120 d=\r\neg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is not a junction between  \n&gt; agni\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd jala...I want to her your words if you have any.\n&gt;\n&gt; Parasara&#39;s definiti=\r\non of gandanta is restricted to two neighboring  \n&gt; areas in a contiguous s=\r\npace having a predominance of fire and water  \n&gt; elements. &quot;I see fire and =\r\nI see water. So there is gandanta&quot; is a  \n&gt; wrong approach. One can then ca=\r\nll Venus, a watery planet, being in a  \n&gt; fiery sign or Mars, a fiery plane=\r\nt, being in a watery sign as  \n&gt; gandanta. Gandanta requires a *transition*=\r\n in a contiguous space.\n&gt;\n&gt; In your example of upapada lord&#39;s tithi, there =\r\nis no contiguous  \n&gt; space where there is a water-fire transition.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No=\r\nw somewhere you talked of wasting time!!!

You keep saying Parasara says so and yet there =\r\nis  \n&gt; nothing forthcoming.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya=\r\n as the rashi come into  \n&gt; existence because of the Sun, which is the agni=\r\n tattva. Vara is also  \n&gt; agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That=\r\n is why Vaara is  \n&gt; related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the vaara =\r\nof the lords  \n&gt; of the rashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi related=\r\n to a  \n&gt; bhaava and for this reason, fasting and other such karma related =\r\nto  \n&gt; rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Moon is the significator of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional  \n&gt; conten=\r\nt* related to the maya manifestation of everything in life.  \n&gt; Suffering i=\r\ns caused as we do not fathom the karma associated that  \n&gt; resulted in suff=\r\nering and fasting is a a means of self punishment  \n&gt; and correction relate=\r\nd to the raashi where the aroodha is. Just as  \n&gt; Agni has the purity to bu=\r\nrn the root of sin, fasting on vaara  \n&gt; related to the UL is surely going =\r\nto cleanse the sins associated  \n&gt; with the suffering in it. While this may=\r\n not give a 100%  \n&gt; satisfaction as the *moon* content has not been addres=\r\nsed, at least  \n&gt; the initiation of the aroodha occurs and people find thei=\r\nr partners,  \n&gt; get married and get along with life. Proof lies in the pudd=\r\ning and  \n&gt; with so many cases where people have fasted on UL days and have=\r\n got  \n&gt; result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why fas=\r\nt?  \n&gt; Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with  =\r\n\n&gt; the raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related to the  \n&gt; mate=\r\nrial effects of the bhava and that is what people are looking  \n&gt; for when =\r\nthey come to th astrologer. You have done well to recall my  \n&gt; teachings i=\r\nn this =E2=80=93 remember what I taught =E2=80=93 Men should worship  \n&gt; a =\r\nfemale deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL  \n&gt; fasting. I=\r\n wonder if they really follow this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why not give fasting at night i=\r\nnstead of day? Sun is always good  \n&gt; for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and tha=\r\nt is why we have limited this  \n&gt; to day fasting and not night fasting as w=\r\nell or 24 hour fast. This  \n&gt; is my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders w=\r\nould have given long  \n&gt; periods of fast starting from the vaara, like keep=\r\ning 21 days fast  \n&gt; for the birth of child! You think I should be doing th=\r\nat! You think  \n&gt; anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself before asking me to a=\r\ndvise those  \n&gt; hard penance kind of fasts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who says the Moon has n=\r\nothing to do with the arudha. It is the  \n&gt; sustainer. Now people to an ast=\r\nrologer when they are looking for  \n&gt; getting married and hardly anyone com=\r\nes these days asking for  \n&gt; prolonging marriage. Either they want to get i=\r\nnto one or get out of  \n&gt; one and into another...astrologers these days are=\r\n relegated to  \n&gt; helping people make these transitions painless and fast. =\r\nOf course  \n&gt; some have come and I have not failed them. I have a ready shl=\r\noka for  \n&gt; this =E2=80=93 start from Taurus in Hamsa gati:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gouri, =\r\nKaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Durga, Kanti, Saraswati\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mangalaa, Vaishnavi, L=\r\nakshmi, Shivaa, Naraayani\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; See I have them ready for the 12 signs in=\r\n Hamsa Gati from the mool  \n&gt; trikona of Moon in hamsa gati\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mantra =\r\nShastra is a very detailed work and includes mantra dosha  \n&gt; etc. It is ve=\r\nry scientific and accurate. It takes a lifetime to  \n&gt; master this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n You talk of begging God vs commanding God? Now where did that come  \n&gt; fro=\r\nm? How is it related to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have  \n&gt; missed=\r\n many mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to  \n&gt; command God i=\r\ns *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the  \n&gt; least. The attitude s=\r\nhould always be that of a beggar in front of  \n&gt; God. If anyone has said ot=\r\nherwise, I also disagee with him/her.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prasiddha mantras always give=\r\n result, even without initiation and  \n&gt; who knows how ready a person is fo=\r\nr initation.

His  \n&gt; section on remedial measures is full of various homa=\r\ns. I am not  \n&gt; dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I =\r\nam in  \n&gt; fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them=\r\n by  \n&gt; themselves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you=\r\n gone through the  \n&gt; Navagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana and othe=\r\nr puranic  \n&gt; literature?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or=\r\n tithi for most of these  \n&gt; homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas f=\r\nor specific birth  \n&gt; doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed=\r\n the tithi or  \n&gt; nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days =\r\nare not  \n&gt; based on any house or arudha in the chart.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath=\r\n:] If Amavasya dosha is to be performed on Amavasya,  \n&gt; when should the wo=\r\nrship of a graha be done? Let us say someone  \n&gt; wishes to worship Mars (Ma=\r\nngala graha). When do you think this  \n&gt; worship should be done?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanja=\r\ny Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana)  \n&gt; got his kn=\r\nowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where  \n&gt; did they get i=\r\nt from?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are menti=\r\noning  \n&gt; complicated principles that are not found in classics or works of=\r\n  \n&gt; rishis and scaring people that performing austerities such as  \n&gt; fast=\r\ning on certain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot;  \n&gt; or &quot;in=\r\nsult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I find these principles  \n&gt; illogical =\r\nand based on hasty thinking. There may be a little  \n&gt; difference between d=\r\noing an austerity on different days, but my  \n&gt; point is that it is smaller=\r\n compared to the difference between doing  \n&gt; and not doing at all and that=\r\n doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not  \n&gt; cause danger as being suggested.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I missed the context and just saw some  \n&gt;=\r\n mails that were forwarded to me amidst my writing. But them its  \n&gt; always=\r\n a pleasure to talk to you as in that many many have  \n&gt; benefitted, and th=\r\nat includes us as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Third, our shastras primarily talk about wo=\r\nrshipping various  \n&gt; deities on various days, based on the energy of the *=\r\ndeity*. For  \n&gt; worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or na=\r\nkshatra  \n&gt; is better than others. This is based on the deity and irrespect=\r\nive  \n&gt; of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man  \n=\r\n&gt; comes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a  \n&gt; beg=\r\ngar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedule and  \n&gt; mood of t=\r\nhe giver is more important.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=E2=80=99s not right=\r\n...at least people who read this  \n&gt; will think. Let=E2=80=99s say Shiva wo=\r\nrship on Mondays. Shiva is the  \n&gt; pratyadhi devata of the Sun and is not w=\r\norshipped on Sundays but on  \n&gt; Mondays. NOTE =E2=80=93 a day after Sunday!=\r\n Similarly Narayana is the  \n&gt; pratyadhi devata of Mercury and is worshippe=\r\nd on Thursdays instead  \n&gt; of Wednesdays. NOTE =E2=80=93 again a day after!=\r\n So what happened to the  \n&gt; energy equation? J\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Choosing the day of=\r\n a remedy based on the deity is more important  \n&gt; and the variations based=\r\n on individual horoscope are less important.  \n&gt; I am not saying there are =\r\nno horoscopic variations. But they are  \n&gt; smaller and, more importantly, I=\r\n question if they are actually well- \n&gt; understood by astrologers today to =\r\napply *reliably*. I question over- \n&gt; emphasizing and over-selling unreliab=\r\nle principles of questionable  \n&gt; origin and scaring people on that basis.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood  \n&gt; =\r\neven the basics of Sanatana dharma! Some behave as if there is a  \n&gt; battle=\r\n going on between Shiva and Vishnu =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s hilarious to see =\r\n \n&gt; how these are just attempts to convert Hinduism into a religion they  \n=\r\n&gt; have left rather than trying to learn what Hinduism means. Being  \n&gt; newl=\r\ny converted there is a bellicose patriotism in them to prove  \n&gt; their fait=\r\nh to the *new god* they have found and every other God  \n&gt; must be the devi=\r\nl in disguise!! It will take years for many to learn  \n&gt; that there is no d=\r\nevil. It=E2=80=99s a figment of their imagination and  \n&gt; whatever is devil=\r\nish is the dark side of mankind himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is  \n&gt; usele=\r\nss\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in gi=\r\nving so many  \n&gt; mantras for\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same devata, like say thousands =\r\nof mantras for Vishnu or  \n&gt; Hanuman\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when any one mantra would su=\r\nffice. OR it is like saying that we  \n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take paracetamol and =\r\npray that cancer is cured. I think I may  \n&gt; have to\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; write a book=\r\n on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the  \n&gt; vedic\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see=\r\nrs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I got your point here. It=E2=80=99s a good point=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now somewhere you talked of wasting time!!! Look what you are  \n&gt;=\r\n doing. You were asked to work on Parashara by your Spiritual Master,  \n&gt; a=\r\nnd are you doing that?

I got into this thread because statements  \n=\r\n&gt; were made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart  \n&gt; ca=\r\nn cause &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot; and &quot;danger to  \n&gt; spouse&quot;, ba=\r\nsed on these far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which is perfect=\r\nly in line with everything I have learnt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, you once taught that ho=\r\nuses represent Sun/Shiva/truth and  \n&gt; arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/percept=\r\nion.

OR it is like saying that we can\n&gt; &gt; take paracet=\r\namol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have  \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; write a b=\r\nook on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the  \n&gt; vedic\n&gt; &gt; seers.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I did not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our ability  \n&gt;=\r\n to use it is limited and we should take our limitations into  \n&gt; considera=\r\ntion.\n&gt;\n&gt; The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many being=\r\ns  \n&gt; and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible  \n&gt;=\r\n between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When  \n&gt; o=\r\nne is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a  \n&gt; mantra (i=\r\n.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind  \n&gt; constantly), t=\r\nhen one experiences the mantra. This perfect  \n&gt; absorption of self-awarene=\r\nss in the mantra then causes internal  \n&gt; changes by the flow of energy int=\r\nernally in specific ways (specific  \n&gt; to the mantra) and that causes corre=\r\nsponding external changes in the  \n&gt; universe and corresponding karmic inte=\r\nractions between various  \n&gt; objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, this variety of mantras,=\r\n experiences and results is  \n&gt; irrelevant to one who does not have such pe=\r\nrfect control over the  \n&gt; mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is=\r\n relevant only to a  \n&gt; seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and henc=\r\ne control over  \n&gt; mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare=\r\n today. Most  \n&gt; people are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do =\r\nnot work  \n&gt; for them as they are supposed to.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nJust repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anything.  \n&gt; Som=\r\ne people may think that certain results come when they repeat a  \n&gt; mantra =\r\ncertain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A  \n&gt; mantra may work=\r\n for one person quickly and another may spend the  \n&gt; whole life chanting i=\r\nt and nothing may happen. Absorption of the  \n&gt; entire mind into a mantra i=\r\ns needed for a mantra to really work and  \n&gt; it is much more difficult than=\r\n one may think.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; A highly learned scholar in the=\r\n court of a king may be able to  \n&gt; command the king and get whatever he wa=\r\nnts from king. An incapable  \n&gt; one is better off begging the king, rather =\r\nthan trying to command  \n&gt; (and failing for sure).\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, most peop=\r\nle are better off begging god for what they want  \n&gt; rather than trying to =\r\nuse the right mantra to command what they  \n&gt; want. A beggar does not need =\r\na huge vocabulary or great scholarship  \n&gt; or knowledge. Feeling of humilit=\r\ny and helplessness, surrender,  \n&gt; patience and persistence are what help a=\r\n beggar succeed. A beggar  \n&gt; needs the right attitude rather than knowledg=\r\ne. In this age and  \n&gt; time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a g=\r\nood beggar at  \n&gt; god&#39;s door.\n&gt;\n&gt; What people today need for material and s=\r\npiritual progress through  \n&gt; remedial measures is a better attitude in beg=\r\nging god rather than a  \n&gt; better choice of tools such as mantras and other=\r\n specifics such as  \n&gt; weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result from=\r\n god.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came=\r\n in  \n&gt; the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra =\r\n \n&gt; based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct  \n&gt;=\r\n attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence,  \n&gt; dis=\r\ncipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful  \n&gt; than t=\r\nrying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and  \n&gt; impress go=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; One more thing. We have many mantras given b=\r\ny rishis, but the  \n&gt; guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a=\r\n mantra based  \n&gt; on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do n=\r\not operate  \n&gt; solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules comi=\r\nng from  \n&gt; various traditions. They are not free from corruption and  \n&gt; i=\r\nmperfection. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various  \n&gt; res=\r\nults, irrespective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who  \n&gt; is th=\r\ne 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka  \n&gt; Angaraka =\r\nmantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking of  \n&gt; horoscope is ove=\r\nrplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyond the scope  \n&gt; of Parasara&#39;s guid=\r\nelines.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one has a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru=\r\n  \n&gt; rather than that of an astrology theoretician.\n&gt;\n&gt; If not, there is no=\r\n foolproof way to know the right path. Pick any  \n&gt; path (given by an astro=\r\nloger or one that you feel attracted to)  \n&gt; instead of wasting time and th=\r\nen keep working on your attitude. The  \n&gt; latter is the key. As I said earl=\r\nier, learn to be a humble beggar at  \n&gt; god&#39;s door. Choice of Mantra is sec=\r\nondary and attitude is primary.  \n&gt; If you succeed in being a really humble=\r\n beggar, you stand a better  \n&gt; chance of success than great scholars.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAny prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari,  \n&gt; na=\r\nvakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra,  \n&gt; chandip=\r\nath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can  \n&gt; help one ma=\r\nke progress if one develops the right attitude. Without  \n&gt; the right attit=\r\nude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope this sufficiently clarifies my stand. I discuss these matte=\r\nrs  \n&gt; related to spiritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.  \n=\r\n&gt; Some writings are sampled at http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/writing=\r\ns.htm \n&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; om paramesthi gurave namah\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Since you do not have any real definition of Gandant=\r\na, I am dropping  \n&gt; that and continue with my belief of the junction betwe=\r\nen Agni and  \n&gt; Jala rasi as the case of gandanta and the loka junctions. W=\r\nhich is  \n&gt; perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two statem=\r\nents you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish  \n&gt; and Mantra Shas=\r\ntra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you  \n&gt; well out here -\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; 1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as  \n&gt; =\r\nthe sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to.  \n&gt; Result=\r\ns maybe a bit delayed but will be there.\n&gt; 2. Statement 2: *reciting any pr=\r\nayer* will give the desired effects  \n&gt; for any ailment we wish to remedy\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; Statement =\r\n1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is  \n&gt; bogus and has no =\r\nrelevance as the remedial measures prescribed by  \n&gt; Parasara and others to=\r\n be done on specific days are irrlevant and  \n&gt; not of much consequence. Th=\r\nis sounds like another astrologer I had  \n&gt; known some time back whose stat=\r\nements like this coerced me to write  \n&gt; Vedic Remedies in Astrology so tha=\r\nt people are not misled but such  \n&gt; pretexts to knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; Statement 2=\r\n is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is  \n&gt; useless and the Rish=\r\ni=E2=80=99s were wasting time in giving so many  \n&gt; mantras for the same de=\r\nvata, like say thousands of mantras for  \n&gt; Vishnu or Hanuman when any one =\r\nmantra would suffice. OR it is like  \n&gt; saying that we can take paracetamol=\r\n and pray that cancer is cured. I  \n&gt; think I may have to write a book on M=\r\nantra Shastra to validate the  \n&gt; teachings of the vedic seers.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think=\r\n there is something wrong in the way you are saying what you  \n&gt; want to sa=\r\ny. Please rethink and correct your statements for the sake  \n&gt; of good reco=\r\nrd in this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; With Warm Regards\n&gt; Sanjay Rath\n&gt; http://srath.com htt=\r\np://sohamsa.com http://srijagannath.org\n&gt; 15B Gangaram Hospital Road, New D=\r\nelhi, 110060, India\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR. Rao\n&gt; To: sohamsa@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 08, 2009 12:0=\r\n3 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: ALTERNATIVE TO UPAPADA FASTING\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sanjay and f=\r\nriends,\n&gt;\n&gt; My answers are in red and prefixed with &quot;[Narasimha]&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a =\r\nrashi and carries  \n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the da=\r\ny ruled by tithi of the  \n&gt; 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala en=\r\nergy to vara, and gandanta  \n&gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into=\r\n a danger. So, what is the way  \n&gt; out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why does a rashi carry the =\r\nenergy of vaara only and not that of  \n&gt; the tithi???? Why does rashi repre=\r\nsent vaara or fire?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by S=\r\nurya and for doing  \n&gt; so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...N=\r\narasimha you ask  \n&gt; this?? What is happening?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all, Rudra rul=\r\nes over the element of fire and Gouri rules  \n&gt; over the element of water a=\r\nnd one worships Gouri at the time of  \n&gt; marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) =\r\nis the karaka for marriage. So one  \n&gt; could even say that UL/marriage is r=\r\nepresented by water element and  \n&gt; fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the e=\r\nlement of water (prosperity  \n&gt; and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One=\r\n could even say that  \n&gt; fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohib=\r\nited as it brings  \n&gt; the fire element represented by weekday to the water =\r\nof UL and  \n&gt; causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and =\r\nis associated with the Raashi  \n&gt; Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the cre=\r\nator of the UL...just as  \n&gt; the mother Gouri creates everything through th=\r\ne shakti of the graha,  \n&gt; all the arudha are created by her due to the lor=\r\ndships of the  \n&gt; planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord =\r\nwill be a  \n&gt; *more correct* answer.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Narasim=\r\nha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun  \n&gt; (aatman) a=\r\nnd arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, 12th house is the actual c=\r\nreator and UL is the apparent  \n&gt; creator in the field of maya. Houses (tru=\r\nth) should actually be  \n&gt; associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not =\r\nGouri), while arudha  \n&gt; padas (perception) should actually be associated w=\r\nith Moon (mind)  \n&gt; and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod =\r\nmethod in  \n&gt; dasa judgment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, it is actually more logical to say t=\r\nhat 12th house and 12th  \n&gt; lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and U=\r\nL lord imbibe the  \n&gt; jala tattva of Moon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the above &quot;*more correct*=\r\n answer&quot; based on your own thinking or  \n&gt; is it from a classic or from tra=\r\ndition?\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; The mantra one meditates with at =\r\nthe end of a day&#39;s fasting is far  \n&gt; more effective than at other times. T=\r\nhe conservation of energy  \n&gt; otherwise spent on digestion or speech will e=\r\nnable far more  \n&gt; effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and t=\r\nhen meditate  \n&gt; with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the  \n&gt; best =\r\nblessing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the  \n&gt; mind is t=\r\nroubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and  \n&gt; this distur=\r\nbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many  \n&gt; many times better=\r\n than complete fasting.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Narasimha] Well, if =\r\none cannot fast, then one is destined to expend  \n&gt; some energy on digestio=\r\nn after all and not focus all energy on the  \n&gt; mantra. But the bottomline =\r\nis that shastras say that one should  \n&gt; meditate either without or with ve=\r\nry little food (niraahaaro  \n&gt; mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree th=\r\nat meditation sessions  \n&gt; after heavy eating are heavily restrained in eff=\r\nectiveness.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; Seriously, however, this kind=\r\n of stretching of gandanta concepts  \n&gt; is quite illogical.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay=\r\n Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very definition  \n&gt; of gandanta =\r\n=E2=80=93 the interface between fire and water. Put a burning  \n&gt; match in =\r\na glass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=E2=80=99s  \n&gt; in th=\r\ne chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between  \n&gt; Kanya a=\r\nnd Tula.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Narasimha] Putting a burning match =\r\nin a glass of water does indeed  \n&gt; kill fire. But the question is of conta=\r\nct. If I am thinking of fire  \n&gt; in my mind while standing in water, it doe=\r\ns not kill the fire. There  \n&gt; is no contact.\n&gt;\n&gt; My point is that the exam=\r\nples given have no real identifiable  \n&gt; contact between water and fire.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; One can be creative and come up with a lot of theories. For example,  \n&gt; =\r\none can say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show  \n&gt; agni=\r\n tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and some  \n&gt; as water=\r\n rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus  \n&gt; cause contact=\r\n between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on  \n&gt; the weekdays of th=\r\ne dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta  \n&gt; and serious danger.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what counts  \n&gt; as =\r\ncontact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolations.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish..=\r\n..then again  \n&gt; you told me two years back and again recently that you are=\r\n leaving  \n&gt; jyotish. Now it is getting very evident that *jyotish is leavi=\r\nng  \n&gt; you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =E2=80=93 individuals embo=\r\ndy it  \n&gt; in different levels of their understanding and intelligence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s c=\r\nannot be taken  \n&gt; away. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some=\r\n rejoice  \n&gt; when it seems like something comes and cry when it seems like =\r\n \n&gt; something leaves. Some impassionately observe as things seem to come  \n=\r\n&gt; and go and do what they see as their dharma with the things they  \n&gt; seem=\r\n to have.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a factual correction though\n&gt; : I never said I was leavi=\r\nng Jyotish. For a few years after my  \n&gt; spiritual master entered my life, =\r\nmy interest in other things went  \n&gt; down (though I continued to do other t=\r\nhings) and my focus on  \n&gt; spiritual sadhana intensified. So I said that my=\r\n interest in Jyotish  \n&gt; was very low. However, my guru gave me a task late=\r\nr. He wanted me to  \n&gt; study the teachings of Parasara independently, medit=\r\nate on them and  \n&gt; share my interpretations with the world. He said I was =\r\nvery  \n&gt; passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and he wanted me to d=\r\no  \n&gt; the same now but dispassionately and without an attachment. He felt  =\r\n\n&gt; that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me to  \n&gt; =\r\ndo it as an unattached karma. His word is everything for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I tol=\r\nd you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but what  \n&gt; I said above.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; However, if your judgment is correct and if Jyotish is indeed  \n&gt; &quot;lea=\r\nving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual guru will realize it sooner or  \n&gt; later a=\r\nnd change his command to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; I can catego=\r\nrically declare one thing with utmost confidence. You  \n&gt; pick any weekday =\r\nor tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata  \n&gt; (remain silent) on th=\r\nat weekday or tithi and meditate with a  \n&gt; particular mantra (any) at the =\r\nend of the day. You can take a vow to  \n&gt; keep that practice for a certain =\r\nduration of time (say, a few months  \n&gt; or years) for a specific purpose. T=\r\nake a vow and keep the vrata for  \n&gt; the duration. If brahmacharya can be k=\r\nept for the duration of the  \n&gt; vrata, there is nothing like it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [S=\r\nanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you seem to be  \n&gt; saying t=\r\nhat the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not  \n&gt; much relevan=\r\nce. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually  \n&gt; beneficial. For e=\r\nxample, a person wishing to marry should not fast  \n&gt; on UL days and should=\r\n choose any day (all days are the same) or any  \n&gt; tithi (all tithi are the=\r\n same) and start fasting and do a mantra  \n&gt; (any mantra!!) and then in a f=\r\new days, or (maybe) a few months (or  \n&gt; maybe) a few years ... or maybe (w=\r\nhat you did not say), a few  \n&gt; lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cann=\r\not say you are wrong, so  \n&gt; I agree that what you say is right.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; E=\r\nnd quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is all th=\r\nat is being taught and practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas  \n&gt; and other t=\r\neachings of the seers&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; I did not say all days and tithis are the same.=\r\n Of course, there is  \n&gt; some difference. But, it is not as big as being ma=\r\nde here.\n&gt;\n&gt; To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or mil=\r\nk of a  \n&gt; brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does mak=\r\ne  \n&gt; some difference. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and  \n&gt; &quot;s=\r\nerious doshas&quot; (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be  \n&gt; caused by =\r\na wrong choice is wrong. To say that a wrong choice means  \n&gt; khoa will tak=\r\ne 100 years to make is also a gross exaggeration.\n&gt;\n&gt; The main thing is tha=\r\nt you need milk and sugar. If one is confused  \n&gt; by endless claims of khoa=\r\n making consultants and ends up not making  \n&gt; khoa at all, that will be sa=\r\nd. In such a case, one can simply pick  \n&gt; some milk or the other, take sug=\r\nar and start cooking khoa. It will  \n&gt; take an extra half hour, but the job=\r\n will be done.\n&gt;\n&gt; I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humbly and=\r\n not engage  \n&gt; in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fasti=\r\nng on a  \n&gt; specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and  \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon  \n&gt; Jy=\r\notish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importance  \n&gt; from=\r\n us does not help our cause!\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not ov=\r\nersell it or overplay the  \n&gt; importance...\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like  \n&gt; pra=\r\nyers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any  \n&gt; harm.=\r\n If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or  \n&gt; tithi w=\r\nithout too many calculations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya is good f=\r\nor someone planning to have a  \n&gt; baby or one who cannot conceive and this =\r\nis kept for some period  \n&gt; before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahmacha=\r\nrya is good for  \n&gt; marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from ph=\r\nysical union  \n&gt; as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quot=\r\ne &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much more, but also ver=\r\ny  \n&gt; difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a good enough  \n&gt; auste=\r\nrity. Physical celibacy over an extended period of time  \n&gt; increases the e=\r\nfficacy of other austerities such as fasting, mouna  \n&gt; vrata, meditation a=\r\nnd homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath =\r\nCentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sjrath@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; om paramesthi gurave namah\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just added a few thoughts and questions since=\r\n we are on the topic  \n&gt; of spirituality, which is not my forte.

It  \n&gt; is funny that I should be typ=\r\ning this email on an Ekadashi day, when  \n&gt; many Vaishnavas fast irrespecti=\r\nve of their horoscopes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I write on dvadasi when so m=\r\nany vasihnava also fast  \n&gt; and keep great austerities. J Any difference?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the question raised. 2nd  \n&gt; bh=\r\nava is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day o=\r\nf  \n&gt; UL in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu who provides the =\r\nfood  \n&gt; for us.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my disag=\r\nreement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to Vishnu. Self=\r\n- \n&gt; deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or speech  \n&gt; =\r\n(mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or  \n&gt; speec=\r\nh is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e.  \n&gt; brahmacharya) =\r\nis not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though Br=\r\nahma was very angry that his sons  \n&gt; decided not to have progeny and staye=\r\nd celibate. So He created  \n&gt; others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons re=\r\nmained celibate? Why  \n&gt; should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate=\r\n? How is it an  \n&gt; insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking p=\r\nlanet  \n&gt; signification of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation  \n&gt;=\r\n process...which is wrong Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of  \n&gt; dusth=\r\nana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna or 7th which is....you know  \n&gt; this.There is no=\r\nthing wrong with the 7th house as it is necessary  \n&gt; for procreation. It i=\r\ns only the link of this with the Brahma graha  \n&gt; that causes it to become =\r\na serious shad-ripu. Married people are as  \n&gt; eligible for moksha as unmar=\r\nried ones and bachelors. It depends on  \n&gt; the following of dharma and ashr=\r\nama.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Various gods bestow various things on us, some at the gross  \n=\r\n&gt; physical level and some at the subtle spiritual level. As we  \n&gt; overcome=\r\n our dependendency on gross things, we make progress at the  \n&gt; subtle leve=\r\nl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle  \n&gt;=\r\n internal energy associated with it) is used for digesting it and for  \n&gt; g=\r\nenerating physical energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy  \n&gt; is =\r\nunused and available for other things. This is a tremendous  \n&gt; benefit. As=\r\n a result, one can better digest mantras and spiritual  \n&gt; food available a=\r\nll around one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s =\r\nfasting is far  \n&gt; more effective than at other times. The conservation of =\r\nenergy  \n&gt; otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more  \n&gt; =\r\neffective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate  \n&gt; wi=\r\nth a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I=\r\n do not agree with this. Correct eating is the  \n&gt; best blessing for good m=\r\nantra practise. On days when one fasts the  \n&gt; mind is troubled by hunger c=\r\nausing the stomach to burn and churn and  \n&gt; this disturbs mantra japa. Cor=\r\nrect eating (alpa aahaara) is many  \n&gt; many times better than complete fast=\r\ning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not heard this about 2nd lo=\r\nrd and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carri=\r\nes  \n&gt; energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tith=\r\ni of the  \n&gt; 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, a=\r\nnd gandanta  \n&gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, =\r\nwhat is the way  \n&gt; out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara=\r\n only and not that of  \n&gt; the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or f=\r\nire?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for do=\r\ning  \n&gt; so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you as=\r\nk  \n&gt; this?? What is happening?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the ele=\r\nment of fire and Gouri rules  \n&gt; over the element of water and one worships=\r\n Gouri at the time of  \n&gt; marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka f=\r\nor marriage. So one  \n&gt; could even say that UL/marriage is represented by w=\r\nater element and  \n&gt; fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water=\r\n (prosperity  \n&gt; and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say=\r\n that  \n&gt; fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brin=\r\ngs  \n&gt; the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and  \n&gt; c=\r\nauses &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated w=\r\nith the Raashi  \n&gt; Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL.=\r\n..just as  \n&gt; the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the=\r\n graha,  \n&gt; all the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the  =\r\n\n&gt; planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a  \n&gt; *=\r\nmore correct* answer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching o=\r\nf gandanta concepts  \n&gt; is quite illogical.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is no=\r\nt stretching ... it is the very definition  \n&gt; of gandanta =E2=80=93 the in=\r\nterface between fire and water. Put a burning  \n&gt; match in a glass of water=\r\n, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=E2=80=99s  \n&gt; in the chart but they=\r\n are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between  \n&gt; Kanya and Tula.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Now one more thing: Marriage is a yoga between two souls and why  \n&gt; not s=\r\nuggest fasting on the yoga day of the UL lord?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What!=\r\n What a brilliant suggestion...why don=E2=80=99t you  \n&gt; start it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now suppose instead of 11th house if Mercury goes to 12th h=\r\nouse  \n&gt; or 4\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house then you cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi for =\r\nthe same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because these thithis are ruled by Mercury only and fasting =\r\non  \n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tithis will create serious doshas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Picking tithi=\r\n based on house (12th house - Dwadashi, 4th house -  \n&gt; Chaturthi) is illog=\r\nical as there are 12 houses only and more tithis.\n&gt; &gt; I have realized one t=\r\nhing over the years - If something is not  \n&gt; structurally sound, it is mos=\r\nt likely false knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] J No comments\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmost confidence. You=\r\n  \n&gt; pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata  \n&gt;=\r\n (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a  \n&gt; particula=\r\nr mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to  \n&gt; keep that p=\r\nractice for a certain duration of time (say, a few months  \n&gt; or years) for=\r\n a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for  \n&gt; the duration. If=\r\n brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the  \n&gt; vrata, there is nothi=\r\nng like it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you s=\r\neem to be  \n&gt; saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is o=\r\nf not  \n&gt; much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually=\r\n  \n&gt; beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast  \n&gt;=\r\n on UL days and should choose any day (all days are the same) or any  \n&gt; ti=\r\nthi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra  \n&gt; (any man=\r\ntra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or  \n&gt; maybe) a few=\r\n years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few  \n&gt; lifetimes, the marria=\r\nge will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so  \n&gt; I agree that what you sa=\r\ny is right.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you keep such a vrata sincerely, you will make posit=\r\nive  \n&gt; progress towards achieving your purpose and definitely not go  \n&gt; b=\r\nackwards, irrespective of what is said by technical calculations  \n&gt; based =\r\non our half-baked Jyotish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My friends, use =\r\nthe Jyotish knowledge available, but do realize  \n&gt; that it is imperfect an=\r\nd corrupted. Why is only the UL lord  \n&gt; important? So many planets may hav=\r\ne so many kinds of influence on UL  \n&gt; in a chart. And UL is one of several=\r\n factors showing marriage. There  \n&gt; may be various influences in a chart s=\r\nhowing marriage. Is our thumb  \n&gt; rule of using UL lord&#39;s weekday missing s=\r\nome important factors?  \n&gt; Quite possible!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That is a=\r\n very nasty statement. Once again you have  \n&gt; used adjectives (*imperfect,=\r\n corrupted*) which is not becoming of  \n&gt; you. Why must you use nasty state=\r\nments? Can=E2=80=99t you say things nicely?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Three years back you sa=\r\nid you are leaving jyotish....then again  \n&gt; you told me two years back and=\r\n again recently that you are leaving  \n&gt; jyotish. Now it is getting very ev=\r\nident that *jyotish is leaving  \n&gt; you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFEC=\r\nT =E2=80=93 individuals embody it  \n&gt; in different levels of their understa=\r\nnding and intelligence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have the time to listen to the Jaimi=\r\nni Lectures at http://sohamsa.com/js/ \n&gt;  do so as it will show you the dep=\r\nths of this knowledge you cannot  \n&gt; imagine exists in jyotish. The derivat=\r\nion of the chnhandas and what  \n&gt; not all. Thumb rules are meant for beginn=\r\ners. The day you decided to  \n&gt; give up jyotish, you got stuck in the thumb=\r\n rules but then its ok  \n&gt; with me. I always wished you the best in whateve=\r\nr you do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection, if a th=\r\numb rule  \n&gt; allows you to pick an austerity with confidence and create the=\r\n  \n&gt; mental feeling that you are doing the best possible\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
