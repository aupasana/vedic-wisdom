I personally have a custom \nbuilt 4-side open 2 ft x 2 ft x 1ft deep homa kundam with a chimney going \nup, supported by 4 pillars on 4 sides. I do homam in it using wood and with \nbig fire. The video was not shot using that set up, as I wanted to \ndemonstrate a setup that would work for most people.\n\nSeveral people in US are doing without using wood and using only dry coconut \npieces. That minimizes smoke and there is considerable smoke only at the \nend. Before smoke comes at the end, they move the homa kundam and put it \nunder an exhaust fan in kitchen or outside. That minimizes the smoke.\n\nIf you have a wood burning fireplace, I suggest placing a copper homa kundam \ninside the fireplace and doing homam in it.\n\nModakas are perfectly acceptable in Ganapathi homam if one has fire big \nenough to completely burn them. If one is doing homam with a few dry coconut \npieces, one cannot burn modakas. Homam can be performed before or after \nsunrise on any day. But the one hour before and after sunrise is a really \nreally good time for homam.\n\nImportant thing is that you should have faith and devotion. Outside of the \nhomam time, keep watching your thoughts and actions, identify egoistic \nmotives behind them and suppress the egoistic instincts. Homam will aid in \nthat process and that process will help you do a better homam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 18, 2009 12:28 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] homam questions\n\n\n&gt; Dear Sri Narasimhagaru,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank your for your response on Spiritual advice directing me to do \n&gt; Ganapathi Homam. I am going to follow the advice. Anyway, I have some \n&gt; other questions now. I have learnt how to perform Ganapathi Homam and \n&gt; Gayatri Homam from our local priest (we used to call him Sharmaji. He is \n&gt; no longer here and moved to Texas) here in Michigan. He taught me a \n&gt; procedure called &quot;Chatushpatra Prayogam&quot; that I use for these Homams. I \n&gt; have also reviewed your pdf files, the audio mp3s and videos for many \n&gt; homams that have been described in your site and noticed that your \n&gt; documents do include what Our priest taught and more. So, I am thinking of \n&gt; following your procedure. Also, Our Sharmaji used to perform the homam in \n&gt; our Wood Burning Fire Place. From your video, I understand that you are \n&gt; doing it in open, in a room. How do you control Smoke so that it won&#39;t \n&gt; darken the ceiling and the walls? Is it ok to do it in Wood Burning fire \n&gt; place? The only problem I see in doing it in fireplace is that I cannot do \n&gt; pradakshinam to the fire (in case that is needed), and it is not \n&gt; convenient to reach back of the homa kundam to put the darbhas and other \n&gt; puja materials. Also more than one Ritvik cannot do the homam in case I am \n&gt; involving other people. How much do these matter? One other procedure our \n&gt; Sharmaji instructed is that it is preferable that Ganapathi homam be \n&gt; performed on Shukla Chaturthi and before the sunrise and he said that we \n&gt; should put modakas in the fire. What do you say about those aspects. I \n&gt; know purity of mind and sincerety in performing this ritual is of \n&gt; paramount importance than the ritualistic details, but I want to follow \n&gt; the prescribed procedures to the extent possible.\n\n\n"}}
