(you k=\r\nnow what I \nmean..!!!). That fear has been distilled completely in both our=\r\n \nfamilies and they are persuading us to let go this relation.\n\nWe both are=\r\n in a state of shock and dilemma as to what needs to be \ndone and what is t=\r\nhe next step to take. But, we love each other truly \nand never in this 7 ye=\r\nars we lost love for each other.\n\nThis is a real overturn of things which w=\r\ne never ever expected. I just \nwould want to know -\n\na. How much weightage =\r\nmust be given to their prediction based on the \nhoroscope? \n\nb. Will the ev=\r\nent actually take place if I get married to her?\n\nKindly provide an insight=\r\nful answer as this is a crucial decision in \nmy life.\n\nThank you\n\n\n"}}
