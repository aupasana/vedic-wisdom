I respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;More importantly, if you=\r\nr understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL inc=\r\narnation but occurring well before?&gt;&gt;\n\nGood=C2=A0question!=C2=A0=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nThat is because, SB is not concerned with the dasavatara. It lists 22 A=\r\nvataras! It=C2=A0deals with the idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of =\r\n9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It also=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avat=\r\nara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22. It is only in other puranas, t=\r\nhat we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the term becomes popular. \n=C2=A0\nA=\r\nnd ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appea=\r\nrence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavatara. Else no. I find the e=\r\nvolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Avataras too compelling to be igno=\r\nred.=C2=A0=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulat=\r\ned by any form&gt;&gt;\n\n\nThis, I am in total agreement with. Infact, in the 10th =\r\nChapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, this One is=\r\n not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation of conception. Hence=\r\n, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and among the Vr=\r\nishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of av=\r\nataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of =\r\nevolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are=\r\n perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n\nAs I said, the SB list cont=\r\nains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is m=\r\ny point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any =\r\nuse. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will represent =\r\nall Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.\n=C2=A0\nS=\r\necondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what=\r\n must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n=C2=A0\nOr, just surmi=\r\nsing, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the ear=\r\nth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he=\r\n does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the=\r\n last Avatara comes.\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars f=\r\nrom the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some traditions co=\r\nnsider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThe conc=\r\nept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly dif=\r\nferent. Avatara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on th=\r\nis world=C2=A0during times of severe crisis to=C2=A0cause a drastic and fun=\r\ndamental=C2=A0transition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which can app=\r\near to help out, directly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need n=\r\not be spiritual. It could be in any field of work.=C2=A0Sometimes a Vibhuti=\r\n may not even be aware of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.\n=C2=A0\nBasically,=\r\n whenever we see excellence in any form, in any field, it is always the ene=\r\nrgy of the One at work..\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto m=\r\namAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Narasi=\r\nmha P.V.R.

Mor=\r\ne importantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occur=\r\nring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nFirst, regarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagava=\r\ntam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vy=\r\nasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poo=\r\nrnavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amo=\r\nunt of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).\n=C2=A0\nSe=\r\ncondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innum=\r\nerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avatara=\r\ns of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to sa=\r\ny &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question i=\r\nf the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is acc=\r\nurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are =\r\npartial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Kris=\r\nhna are poornavataras.\n=C2=A0\nThird, let us ask a very fundamental question=\r\n: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhile SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, i=\r\nt also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (=\r\narUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufacture=\r\nd by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms o=\r\nf Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and =\r\nis beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, aga=\r\nin, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;L=\r\nord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based o=\r\nn their fancies and conditioning..\n=C2=A0\nAll beings are made up of paramat=\r\nma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter=\r\n portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Grea=\r\nt avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras=\r\n descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Kris=\r\nhna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n=C2=A0\nThey are entirely divin=\r\ne, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire d=\r\nivinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain th=\r\ne entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine =\r\nwill but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But=\r\n I do not\n&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt; realiz=\r\nation, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt; an end in a void.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nFirst, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s =\r\nlist. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then y=\r\nour concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; a=\r\ns you theorize.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mer=\r\ncury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comp=\r\nrehension. Logical mind and its spirit of comprehension are inherently fall=\r\nible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping t=\r\nhe Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wond=\r\ner it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is =\r\nwhat Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the=\r\n Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great s=\r\npiritual force in this world in this age.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIf =\r\nyou dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrupt=\r\nion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are p=\r\nerfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking some=\r\n SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)\n=C2=A0\nThe bottomline as far as=\r\n I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent =\r\nesoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - s=\r\npirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - =\r\nspirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a=\r\n highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterical=\r\nly is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions i=\r\nn them.\n=C2=A0\nIf we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided co=\r\nnclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other de=\r\nities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one a=\r\nnd other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nOn a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior=\r\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to =\r\nbe essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating=\r\n between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for e=\r\nven rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant difference=\r\n between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. S=\r\name in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and=\r\n fully divine karma yogis.\n=C2=A0\nIf we think about it, perfected mind (par=\r\namatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented b=\r\ny Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are n=\r\not that different, though the specifics of their stories may be different.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nOne last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is supe=\r\nrior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for suc=\r\nh a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledg=\r\ne and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than changin=\r\ng the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will hav=\r\ne to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik s=\r\ntages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality.

Let me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1.=\r\n In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this=\r\n list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avat=\r\nara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and the=\r\nn the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are inn=\r\numerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable =\r\nothers, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, ar=\r\ne/have been accorded special mention and significance across various Hindu =\r\nspiritual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga,=\r\n namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physic=\r\nal presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Ka=\r\nli started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these =\r\nare scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;3. These 10/9 Avatara=\r\ns have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Va=\r\nmana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakea=\r\nble connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evol=\r\nution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-ani=\r\nmal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form w=\r\nho immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 ste=\r\nps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to t=\r\nhe Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, thi=\r\ns indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another world, bu=\r\nt is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and potentials =\r\nthat lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through various =\r\nlife-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. Tha=\r\nt is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on earth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;4. In this specifc conte=\r\nxt, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not=\r\n my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain=\r\n to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmol=\r\nogy in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. =\r\nAnd each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way an=\r\nd can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A05. Of these=\r\n, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage=\r\n of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of =\r\nmuch easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic=\r\n mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the=\r\n animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force=\r\n for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there=\r\n can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in natur=\r\ne and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki R=\r\namayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He =\r\ndid have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispe=\r\nlled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At t=\r\nhe end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner=\r\n, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was\n the Dharma to do so,=\r\n and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when =\r\nhe lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly=\r\n to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, a=\r\ns a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences t=\r\no it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culmina=\r\nted into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader,=\r\n such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn t=\r\nhe Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be!Krshna, O=\r\nTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=\r\n=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=\r\nachment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =\r\nthat mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=\r\n Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his\n village-folks who so lo=\r\nved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the =\r\nshelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into =\r\nan unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then =\r\nhe understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back o=\r\nnce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when=\r\n the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged=\r\n. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krs=\r\nhna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to e=\r\nveryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala =\r\nabused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling=\r\n and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shis=\r\nhupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly ac=\r\ncused Krshna of being a revolutionist and\n charlatan, Krshna did not kill h=\r\nim. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician,=\r\n wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of =\r\nkings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was b=\r\nack into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one i=\r\nnstance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivoc=\r\nation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others sa=\r\ny or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had =\r\nthe perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. Tha=\r\nt is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yo=\r\ngi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the actio=\r\nn nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the batt=\r\nle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart J=\r\narashanda, or gesturing Bheema to\n hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getti=\r\nng Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew e=\r\nxactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destructio=\r\nn of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational think=\r\ning. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Un=\r\niversal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama =\r\nAvatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut=\r\n Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different =\r\npicture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama=\r\n after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes=\r\n the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramay=\r\nana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is th=\r\ne embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great character=\r\nistics of satwa, chief of\n which is self-control, as well as the occasional=\r\n sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until R=\r\navana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint,=\r\n but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gun=\r\natita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, d=\r\nanava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of neg=\r\native emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations=\r\n.6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fi=\r\nt in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advoca=\r\nted, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of =\r\nthe reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or=\r\n Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this worl=\r\nd and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stage=\r\ns of evolutionary\n development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the re=\r\nason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They =\r\nare no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiri=\r\ntual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical mann=\r\ner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not conside=\r\nr Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must b=\r\ne both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That =\r\nis why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the wo=\r\nrld as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization.=\r\n7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. The=\r\nse are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 to=\r\no subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief th=\r\nat each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full power=\r\n and force\n of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that whi=\r\nch can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and expre=\r\nss itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a referenc=\r\ne point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the para=\r\nble of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet t=\r\no come.8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent which A=\r\nvatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free =\r\nto disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of =\r\nunderstanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the At=\r\nmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimala=\r\nnanda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. Th=\r\nere is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirg=\r\nuna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete purity and might=\r\n and\n force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the =\r\nlast Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the p=\r\nurpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his ad=\r\nult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that=\r\n. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one cap=\r\nable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our ag=\r\ne. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok no=\r\nt to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is wha=\r\nt is closer to truth.-Regards=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam man=\r\nyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

For example, Rama, Krish=\r\nna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.=C2=A0We also know th=\r\nat Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are pers=\r\nonifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdo=\r\nm/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spi=\r\nrit of\n innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively).=C2=A0Co=\r\nrrespondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a=\r\n perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect operates.=C2=\r\n=A0Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Kris=\r\nhna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s stor=\r\ny is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasi=\r\nmha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.=\r\n=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us,=\r\n mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness i=\r\nn us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of=\r\n the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it=\r\n has different qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison =\r\nbetween them.=C2=A0We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and t=\r\nhen\n perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all asp=\r\nects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are in=\r\ncomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.=C2=A0*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like th=\r\ne story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the q=\r\nualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, an=\r\nd one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that =\r\ndemonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of t=\r\naste and subjective preference.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Let us focus on R=\r\nama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of go=\r\nd in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and =\r\nhas no agendas, no likes or dislikes.=C2=A0Once mind fancies a separate exi=\r\nstence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the\n individualized conscio=\r\nusness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strengt=\r\nh and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mi=\r\nnd, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It sup=\r\nports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! =\r\nIt impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so =\r\nthat Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite f=\r\null awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruit=\r\ns. As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain =\r\nthe notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul suppor=\r\nts them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassio=\r\nnately.=C2=A0Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functi=\r\nonality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem intere=\r\nsting enough to some.=C2=A0On the other hand, mind\n has likes, dislikes and=\r\n agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achie=\r\nving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! =\r\nThough soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consci=\r\nousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that=\r\n keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and ev=\r\nen decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;bos=\r\ns&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one w=\r\nho may be excited by this description!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Lord Krishn=\r\na is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.=C2=\r\n=A0Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received =\r\nBrahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was h=\r\nis &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingd=\r\nom. At the last moment, his father\n banished him to forest at the behest of=\r\n his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no compl=\r\naints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to vario=\r\nus degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dh=\r\narma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshma=\r\nna and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassio=\r\nnately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched fo=\r\nr her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave=\r\n her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life sit=\r\nuation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he=\r\n killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate =\r\ndharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned s=\r\nome subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!=C2=A0Rama is a perfe=\r\nct example of a liberated man\n with no desires or agendas who impassionatel=\r\ny discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before libera=\r\ntion. THAT is basically what soul does!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0As anoth=\r\ner example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstrati=\r\non of how wisdom/discrimination operates.=C2=A0He was born as a learned pyg=\r\nmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king wit=\r\nh many great qualities.=C2=A0Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and una=\r\nssuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.=\r\ng. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pri=\r\nde is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demoni=\r\nc qualities are completely suppressed.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Please thin=\r\nk about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demons=\r\ntrations of how various aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clue=\r\ns from\n Maharshi Parasara.=C2=A0Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebra=\r\nte each of them separately. Of course, if you are more attracted to one of =\r\nthem, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are A=\r\nLL capable of relieving us from samsara.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0By the w=\r\nay, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are differe=\r\nnt schools of thought).=C2=A0Best regards,Narasimha--------Astrology & Spir=\r\nituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org -------- \n\n\r\n--192144850-1034539113-1367739294=:13312\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Jai Ma!&lt;BR style=3D&quot;=\r\nRIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROU=\r\nND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courie=\r\nr, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT=\r\n: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Just to clarify, I may have a special l=\r\niking for Krshna, but my aim is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other sp=\r\necial form of God.&nbsp;Just clarifying incase someone gets the wrong impre=\r\nssion.

More importantly, if your understanding is corr=\r\nect, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring =\r\nwell before?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;First, regarding Kris=\r\nhna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is=\r\n not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Ram=\r\na, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expre=\r\nssion) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too\n (though par=\r\namatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Secondly, after describing th=\r\ne avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that al=\r\nl rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is un=\r\nder THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are parti=\r\nal, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishn=\r\na *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say=\r\n that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, P=\r\nararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does i=\r\nt mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also say=\r\ns in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality\n formless (arUpa) an=\r\nd of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the =\r\nqualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to=\r\n clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond=\r\n them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what =\r\nis the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himse=\r\nlf&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their f=\r\nancies and conditioning..&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma =\r\n(supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter po=\r\nrtion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great a=\r\nvataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras de=\r\nscend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna=\r\n are specific examples given by Parasara.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;They are entirely di=\r\nvine, but they do not encapsulate the entire\n divinity!!!! After all, &quot;enti=\r\nre divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contai=\r\nn the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the div=\r\nine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force =\r\nin this world. But I do not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutiona=\r\nry Avatars. His&lt;BR&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static real=\r\nization,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an end in a void.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;First, he IS mentioned in S=\r\nB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your=\r\n &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and =\r\navataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Secon=\r\ndly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logica=\r\nl mind and the spirit of investigation\n and comprehension. Logical mind and=\r\n its &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;spirit of comprehension are =\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not=\r\n capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comp=\r\nrehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt t=\r\no comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has=\r\n a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha wa=\r\ns/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets =\r\nto avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that the vers=\r\nes of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different mat=\r\nter that you are only taking some SB\n verses and ignoring some as I showed!=\r\n.)&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s=\r\n list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each =\r\naspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - sp=\r\nirit of patience &amp; persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and th=\r\ne story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, =\r\nesoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to un=\r\nderstand any higher scriptures and notions in them.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If we take=\r\n scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would con=\r\nclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; som=\r\ne would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inf=\r\nerior&quot;; and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;On a different =\r\nnote, someone may think that\n Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and l=\r\nike Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be essentially=\r\n the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating between them.=\r\n As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even rishis to =\r\nclearly comprehend. People seeing some significant difference between them =\r\nare, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same in the cas=\r\ne of Krishna and Rama. Both were&nbsp; perfectly detached and fully divine =\r\nkarma yogis.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (paramatma &lt;=\r\n/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv=\r\n8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;aspect represented by &lt;/SPAN&gt;Moon)=\r\n and soul (paramatma aspect &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_136=\r\n7025215463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN=\r\n id=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;represented by &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/S=\r\nPAN&gt;Sun) are not really that\n different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama ar=\r\ne not that different, though the specifics of their stories may be differen=\r\nt.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishn=\r\na is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happ=\r\ny for such a person.

In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a =\r\nlist of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2n=\r\nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa =\r\nDeva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu ment=\r\nion that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa sa=\r\nys all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Bein=\r\ng while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: =\r\ntransparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco,=\r\n monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; class=3Dyiv8741=\r\n852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_87&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COL=\r\nOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, mon=\r\naco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; id=3Dyiv874=\r\n1852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_198 class=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_136=\r\n7025215463_88&gt;2.

These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed seq=\r\nuence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama,=\r\n Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of =\r\nthe form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on e=\r\narth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-a=\r\nnimal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately tak=\r\nes possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajash=\r\nik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Ava=\r\ntara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that s=\r\npirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a\n progressiv=\r\ne realization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent=\r\n in the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Large=\r\nr spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand.

In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of thes=\r\ne main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matys=\r\na Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is =\r\nthe nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person=\r\n to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are sel=\r\nf-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dyn=\r\namos.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: no=\r\nrmal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COL=\r\nOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; id=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_13670252154=\r\n63_271 class=3Dyiv8741852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_93&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv874=\r\n1852098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_270&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv874185=\r\n2098yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_222&gt;&nbsp;5. Of these, naturally, Rama and K=\r\nrshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both ins=\r\nide as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this ag=\r\ne. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is=\r\n in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies with=\r\nin and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose.=\r\n However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even=\r\n though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only =\r\nwhen circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel =\r\ndejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear=\r\n before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha w\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
