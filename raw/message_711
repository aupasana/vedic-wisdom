It =\r\ncan awaken Kundalini and make Kundalini reach higher chakras. It can even p=\r\nut one in samadhi. It is too powerful a mantra. Veda mantras in general are=\r\n powerful and Savitri Gayatri mantra is one of the most potent ones.\n \nHowe=\r\nver, pronunciation and intonation have to be perfect when meditating with a=\r\n veda mantra. Very very very few people today are capable of pronouncing Ve=\r\nda mantras perfectly while maintaining a calm and detached mind at the same=\r\n time. Thus, very few people actually *experience* Veda mantras.\n \nOne may =\r\ndefinitely get things like what you described. One may get income growth, i=\r\nntelligence, good predictions, good health etc. But those are not the real =\r\npurpose of this mantra.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI will mention an allegory.=\r\n\n \nIf one has a small aeroplane, one can use it to drive around on a hillsi=\r\nde country road and enjoy beautiful scenery of hills, valleys, villages, tr=\r\nees, green pastures, fields and lakes. But then, the true purpose of the ae=\r\nroplane is to get away from all those things, soar high and fly in the sky.=\r\n One not knowing it may only drive around on roads, enjoy the scenery and m=\r\nay even feel proud of what he is able to do with his aeroplane. One knowing=\r\n what the aeroplane is really for may still be unable to fly because he doe=\r\ns not know how to fly.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI will speak in terms of a m=\r\netaphor.\n \nThis life is a drama. We are actors in the drama. I am not sugge=\r\nsting that you should mess up your role in the drama. Do continue to play y=\r\nour role in the drama. But do so with a full understanding that this is jus=\r\nt a drama, that it will end one day and that you may get a new role in a ne=\r\nw drama. An actor who is supposed to do great deeds in a drama can do them =\r\nwithout thinking foolishly that he is great because he is doing those great=\r\n deeds. An actor who is praised by all in a drama can be praised by everybo=\r\ndy without taking it personally and feeling great about it. An actor who is=\r\n supposed to be faulted and hated by everybody in the drama can get faulted=\r\n and hated by everyone without taking it personally and feeling bad about i=\r\nt. Whether something good or bad happens, it is just happening to a charact=\r\ner in the drama. One should be able to detach oneself from the character on=\r\ne is playing and go through with the role without attaching oneself to the =\r\nexperiences - good or bad - of that character.\n \nA full understanding of th=\r\nis fact of life and imbibing that understanding fully in one&#39;s attitude, th=\r\noughts and actions is what one needs to progress spiritually. The rest - li=\r\nke being able to make your role in the drama do what you like and being abl=\r\ne to make your role in the drama avoid things you do not like - are irrelev=\r\nant. Any things that are only making you get caught further in the drama wi=\r\nthout realizing its fakeness are not helping you, but getting you entangled=\r\n further. The true purpose of spiritual sadhana is to make you realize the =\r\nfakeness of the drama and make you play your role in the drama without gett=\r\ning affected by it or getting carried away.\n \nThe true purpose of Gayatri m=\r\nantra is to unentangle one and make one fully realize this fact of life. As=\r\n I said, it is the mantra of realizing the Self.\n \nIts true purpose is not =\r\nto make this thing or that thing happen in the *drama* of life, but to make=\r\n one *realize* that life is a drama and to give one the ability to *play* o=\r\nne&#39;s role in the drama without being *affected* by it.\n \n*        *        =\r\n*\n \nPersonally, Gayatri mantra is what brought most of the experiences, und=\r\nerstanding and clarity that I could get in my spiritual life. It has been t=\r\nhe vehicle of my spiritual evolution. I am grateful to that mantra, to Moth=\r\ner Savitri, Mother Gayatri and Maharshi Viswamitra.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nI am never a believer in counts. I have seen a lot of evidence of how coun=\r\nt requirements spoil the way people do mantras and render them totally inef=\r\nfective. Doing a mantra for 5 malas with better pronunciation, focus and pe=\r\nace/calmness of mind is far better than doing a mantra for 11 malas with fa=\r\nster and inaccurate pronunciation, less focus and an agitated mind.\n \nWe se=\r\ne so many people doing powerful mantras for lakhs of times without experien=\r\ncing much. I have also seen people experiencing great things very quickly w=\r\nith some mantras, without meeting any significant count requirements.\n \nSur=\r\nrender to your ishta devata, think of the mantra (Gayatri or whatever you d=\r\no) as just a small tool to purify yourself and to remove traces of ego from=\r\n your thoughts and actions and offer the mantra to your ishta devata.\n \nBes=\r\nt regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homa=\r\nm\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: ashwinrawal \n  To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, November 24, 2008 10:30 AM\n  Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Gayatri Mantra\n\n\n  Dear Narsimhaji,\n\n  I would like to k=\r\nnow about Gayatri Mantra in your words. I had very good experiences in my y=\r\noung age when I was doing Gayatri Japam. The very important result of this =\r\nMantra was, I was able to know certain events well in advance that time. I =\r\nhad told one of my friends that he will be transferred in next month to so =\r\nand so place and he was transferred. This is just one example. I was able t=\r\no predict very correctly. Peace in my life with good growth of income I exp=\r\nerienced. Much has been said for Gayatri Mantra but I have not read anythin=\r\ng about this Mantra in this Forum hence this mail posted. \n\n  One great sai=\r\nnt had said in his lectures that everybody should recite at least 11 Malas =\r\n(108 x 11) along with his routine worship\n\n  Your write up and experiences =\r\nif any will inspire us all.\n\n  Dr. Ashwin Rawal \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0283_01C950EF.96251BF0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3429&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Gayatri mantra is essentially a mantra for \nself-realization.

I have seen a lot \nof evidence of how count requirements spoil the way p=\r\neople do mantras and render \nthem totally ineffective. Doing a mantra for 5=\r\n malas with better pronunciation, \nfocus and peace/calmness of mind is far&=\r\nnbsp;better than doing a mantra for 11 \nmalas with faster and inaccurate pr=\r\nonunciation, less focus and an agitated \nmind.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;We s=\r\nee so many people doing powerful mantras for \nlakhs of times without experi=\r\nencing much.
