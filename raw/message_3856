Templ=\r\nes are\n&gt; the agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for templ=\r\nes at all\n&gt; places. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens =\r\nof our\n&gt; gratitude to God.\n&gt; \n&gt; That which is within all, which is seen as =\r\n&quot;This&quot; is the source. He who is\n&gt; within and sees as &quot;This&quot; is God. It is t=\r\nhe reality. It is in yourself. What\n&gt; is limited is Sadhana; what is unlimi=\r\nted is the end.\n&gt; \n&gt; He alone is an Acharya, who, after clearly understandi=\r\nng the conclusive\n&gt; teachings of the Sastras, makes the people of the world=\r\n gain their welfare\n&gt; by making them stick to the path shown in the Sastras=\r\n and also himself does\n&gt; everything according to Sastras and remains in tha=\r\nt experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many acts relating to God, like building temples, diggin=\r\ng tanks are\n&gt; performed. While executing them, there would be many difficul=\r\nties. There\n&gt; would come also several kinds of dishonour. Not minding any o=\r\nf these, they\n&gt; would complete their tasks with mental one-pointedness remo=\r\nving impurities\n&gt; from their minds and letting the mind wander. By straight=\r\nening their mind,\n&gt; they acquire mind control and at the end, they realise =\r\nthe Reality that is\n&gt; to be known. Digging tanks, building temples and such=\r\n other acts are called\n&gt; poorttam. The performance of sacrifices, etc., is =\r\nknown as ishtam. Combining\n&gt; these two, we have the word Ishtapoortam.\n&gt;  I=\r\nn all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need must be with\n&gt; ref=\r\nerence to another. Let action be out of love. Passions such as desire and\n&gt;=\r\n hatred , anger and malice must be totally eschewed. If love becomes the\n&gt; =\r\ngrounding principle of all deeds . then most of the ills of the world will\n=\r\n&gt; vanish.\n&gt; \n&gt; We know many faults we commit, even if others do not know th=\r\nem. Sometimes we\n&gt; realise we are doing so many evil things and repent bitt=\r\nerly and feel why we\n&gt; should be born . Our duty is to pray to God -&quot;I have=\r\n committed so many\n&gt; faults. Will you not, 0 God, give me the will power no=\r\nt do like that in\n&gt; future and will you not purify my mind?&quot; We must note d=\r\nown in a diary every\n&gt; night before we go to bed the faults committed by us=\r\n and pray to God to give\n&gt; us courage and intelligence not to do so. This m=\r\nust be propagated widely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Parameswara and Sriman Narayana are one and =\r\nthe same in reality. They are\n&gt; not two. This is the conclusive view of all=\r\n the sastras. Names differ, forms\n&gt; are different, occupations vary, but th=\r\ne reality which is within Them is one\n&gt; and the same.\n&gt;  What is the purpos=\r\ne of human birth? To earn, to eat, to undergo misery\n&gt; everyday and finally=\r\n to die? Instead of earning and suffering, can we not\n&gt; die now? The purpos=\r\ne of birth is to avoid re-birth. Except man, all animals\n&gt; grow horizontall=\r\ny. Only man grows vertically. Instead of growing\n&gt; horizontally, it is God&#39;=\r\ns will that he should grow vertically in order to\n&gt; look up. God has given =\r\nto animals devices for self-protection; to man alone\n&gt; He has given intelli=\r\ngence. By doing nothing, we avoid re-birth; By giving up\n&gt; attachment, we a=\r\nvoid sins.\n&gt; \n&gt; When any object is consumed by fire, it becomes charred. If=\r\n that black\n&gt; residue is burnt again, it becomes white ash. White ash conti=\r\nnues to remain\n&gt; white even when burnt again. This shows that white is the =\r\nultimate and black\n&gt; is proximate to it. Science tells us that diamond and =\r\ncoal are basically\n&gt; one. White and black are not colours. The primary colo=\r\nurs get separated from\n&gt; the objects to which they are attached when subjec=\r\nted to the test of fire\n&gt; and ultimately white. Similarly, in the mental an=\r\nd spiritual place, the\n&gt; Ultimate Reality is Siva, who is white and proxima=\r\nte to Him is Parvati, who\n&gt; is dark. When we test everything in the fire of=\r\n Jnana, or true knowledge,\n&gt; the residue is Siva. Ash in the material plane=\r\n corresponds to Siva in the\n&gt; spiritual plane. We smear our bodies with the=\r\n sacred ash to remind ourselves\n&gt; of Siva and the fact that the ultimate go=\r\nal of life is Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; Much is said about the personal God and the impers=\r\nonal absolute God with\n&gt; attributes and without attributes. It is only when=\r\n all the colours in the\n&gt; light mix together that we get the colourless ray=\r\ns of the sun. Similarly by\n&gt; the very virtue of being the abode of attribut=\r\nes, God becomes Nirguna,\n&gt; attribute-less.\n&gt; \n&gt; By education we realise Tru=\r\nth. There are many truths, History is one truth.\n&gt; Geography is one truth, =\r\nMathematics is one truth. The content of truth is\n&gt; the greatest in Mathema=\r\ntics. In others, there is an element of imagination.\n&gt; In Geography, we com=\r\ne across names Asia, Africa, Madras, Calcutta, etc.\n&gt; These names were give=\r\nn by us. By imagination, we have given names &quot;plateau&quot;\n&gt; &quot;valley&quot;, etc. By =\r\na process of gradual elimination of all that is imaginary,\n&gt; when we arrive=\r\n at truth, that Truth is found to be God. To think of Him with\n&gt; real devot=\r\nion is the fruit of education.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the use of education? Its first=\r\n use is to develop humility (vinaya).\n&gt; In olden days, the disciple who wen=\r\nt to a guru was called &quot;vineyan&quot; meaning\n&gt; a person of humility which is th=\r\ne hall-mark of Instruction he had from his\n&gt; guru, the fruit of education. =\r\nEducation without humility is no education.\n&gt; Education is the same today a=\r\ns it was before, but methods have changed. The\n&gt; medicine is the same but i=\r\nf the diet is changed, the medicine becomes\n&gt; poison. Education has today b=\r\necome merely the means of livelihood. For true\n&gt; education, the student sho=\r\nuld go to a guru and follow the guru-kula system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right education shou=\r\nld make us know that God is the Truth. Knowledge must\n&gt; fill one with good =\r\nqualities, through which one can realise the Truth, that\n&gt; is God. Therefor=\r\ne, the goal of knowledge is the understanding of the\n&gt; Ultimate Truth. The =\r\nfirst fruit of education must be humility and self\n&gt; control.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tota=\r\nl surrender to the Lord is a means of learning our insignificance\n&gt; and the=\r\n transcendent grace of the Lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we engage an inquiry into the Atma=\r\nn, at the end of it, it will be clear\n&gt; that God is in us as our very self.=\r\n When that stage is reached, we have no\n&gt; use for the devas. Then all karma=\r\ns will fall away from us. But, until then,\n&gt; we must obligatorily do the ka=\r\nrmas directing them to the Gods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who are the leaders of a group,=\r\n society, or state should not neglect\n&gt; the established religious customs a=\r\nnd usages. For themselves the may mot be\n&gt; in need of Church ceremonies, fo=\r\nr instance, their advance in spirituality\n&gt; may not require them. But if th=\r\ney begin to neglect them, the people for whom\n&gt; the rituals are really help=\r\nful, will also start neglecting them. This would\n&gt; be setting a bad example=\r\n. In the words of the Bhagavad Gita, the wise one\n&gt; should not unsettle the=\r\n minds of those who are ignorant, and are attached to\n&gt; action: on the cont=\r\nrary, he should encourage them to perform what they\n&gt; should perform, by hi=\r\nmself doing the appropriate actions well and with\n&gt; diligence. It is duty c=\r\nast upon the leaders and those that are at the top to\n&gt; lead the people fro=\r\nm where they are, and not to refrain from participation\n&gt; in the traditiona=\r\nl ways of worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of all scriptures, the Gita has acquired a specialt=\r\ny of its own. Like this,\n&gt; there are many other books of wisdom. In the Mah=\r\nabharata, there are many\n&gt; chapters teaching wisdom. Besides, in the Sivapu=\r\nrana, Vishnupurana,\n&gt; Skandham, etc., there is Jnanopadesa.\n&gt; \n&gt; So also in=\r\n agamas. But what is the special importance of Gita due to? Not\n&gt; only in o=\r\nur country but in countries like Java, people follow the Gita. My\n&gt; inferen=\r\nce is that because it was born in an atmosphere utterly free from\n&gt; attachm=\r\nent - attachment to life, attachment to body, attachment to kith and\n&gt; kin,=\r\n but out of attachment only to Reality, it has become so famous.\n&gt; \n&gt; On de=\r\nep consideration, ahimsa appears to be good as an ideal or for\n&gt; preaching.=\r\n But practically speaking, it is difficult to follow fully. First\n&gt; of all,=\r\n we must love others. But if we love anyone too much, the end is\n&gt; sorrow. =\r\nTherefore we should love God who always gives happiness and not\n&gt; sorrow. I=\r\n ask myself if we love God, should we not love anyone else in this\n&gt; world?=\r\n So long as there is false knowledge which distinguishes God from the\n&gt; res=\r\nt of the world, there will be differences. If we attain Jnana that God is\n&gt;=\r\n all, we will develop the same love for all that we have for God; This is t=\r\nhe\n&gt; sign of Ahimsa.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the sake of food, clothing and shelter, every=\r\none is toiling and\n&gt; sorrow-stricken. If sorrow is to be banished and if we=\r\n are to be ever happy,\n&gt; we must dedicate all our actions to God. If we get=\r\n His grace, then we need\n&gt; not do anything and can be happy. God is a good =\r\nmaster. By praising Him\n&gt; always, we cannot please Him. He is indifferent t=\r\no our praise or dispraise,\n&gt; action or inaction. But all our actions are or=\r\ndained by Him and are meant\n&gt; only to purify our minds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why so many Go=\r\nds? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak\n&gt; of one God o=\r\nnly and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to\n&gt; satisfy hunge=\r\nr, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger.\n&gt; Then why can&#39;=\r\nt we take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side\n&gt; dishes? So, i=\r\nf we eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food\n&gt; tasty to t=\r\nhe palate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a\n&gt; particular =\r\nGod he worships that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50.h=\r\ntml\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
