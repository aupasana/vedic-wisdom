Kundalini is awakened and rises if one is making pogress towards self-realization, no matter what path one follows and what sadhana one does. Whether one chants Chandipath or mahamantra or Vishnu sahasra naama or Gayatri or Ganapathi atharva seersha or an Islamic holy chant or a Christian holy chant or does no mantra but just engages in selfless service, does not matter. \n \n(2) Kundalini is the force of self-awareness. As one&#39;s false ideas of &quot;I am this&quot; get destroyed and one&#39;s self-awareness becomes refined, it translates to Kundalini awakening and rise.\n \n(3) Certain practices (e.g. some tantras and some praanaayaamas) are normally associated with Kundalini. However, I can declare one thing very confidently. Most people engaged in those practices actually have no clue. As long as one has a firm notion &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini in this body. It will rise from point X in this body to point Y in this body now&quot;, one&#39;s self-awareness is firmly stuck to the body and one&#39;s Kundalini is sure to be fast asleep in Mooladhara. Kundalini spontaneously rises when one&#39;s body awareness goes. Consciously thinking of Kundalini rise is not required. As a matter of fact, it becomes a blockage and makes one cling on to body awareness. In other words, pre-occupation with Kundalini rise blocks Kundalini rise. Forget about Kundalini, forget about chakras, forget even about body. Focus on the mantra and deity and imagine that they alone exist and fill the entire universe.\n \n(4) Kundalini awakening is not something to be feared. Forget all that you may have read. Sat-chid-aananda described in scriptures is obtained when Kundalini is at sahasrara. Even low level aananda (bliss) that is experienced as Kundalini merely rises is far higher than any physical or mental pleasures one may have experienced when one&#39;s self-awareness is firmly rooted in one&#39;s body.\n \nA prince once got a wrong idea that his father wanted to kill him. He ran away and hid in a dirty cave. When sunlight came into the cave, he was happy. When  the cave became dark, he was scared. He lived like that in the cave, happy sometimes and sad at others. He became so attached to the cave that he decided never to leave it. Also, he was afraid to get out of the cave lest he be killed. But his people were looking for him outside, because his father wanted to find his son and coronate him as the king. But, the prince rotted in the cave unaware of this and afraid of going out.\n \nA person&#39;s attachment to body and fear of self-realization is just like the above. Body is like the dirty cave. Self-realization is like getting out of the cave and becoming king.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting the Paath with\n&gt; these motives in mind?\n \nChanting a mantra without being tempted by any desires ever is the best. But, chanting a mantra and falling to some desires now and then is still better than not doing any sadhana. It is not like your desires will leave you automatically if you do not do any sadhana. As sadhana progresses, one *slowly* overcomes weaknesses and desires. The debit from any offenses committed in sadhana due to the few desires left are smaller than the credit from doing the sadhana.\n \nOne may be putting salary money in the bank every month, but some of it may be being deduced for paying bills (mortgage, phone, cable, groceries etc). Still, going to work everyday and putting the salary money in the bank account is better than not working.\n \n&gt; However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I am\n&gt; prepared to disregard the superstitions.\n \nThere are many misconceptions about every spiritual matter in today&#39;s world. After all, this is Kali yuga and we have been through a particularly a dark phase. Just as undigested food becomes toxic, undigested and unassimilated knowledge leads to corruptions and superstitions.\n \nIf you hear a call from inside, do respond to it fearlessly.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- waspieswaspies &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I thought that there was no better place to ask this question since this is the yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the Chandi Homam along with Shri Narasimhaji&#39;s words. My desire to praise the Divine Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we are coming close to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to start with the recitation first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing the homam. (Learning to walk before learning to run) :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if you had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly share how you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter objections from outside from fellow friends and family members who say that &quot;the Chandi homam isn&#39;t part of the family tradition&quot; hence the family devta won&#39;t be pleased or &quot;un-initiated people cannot perform such a high level ritual&quot; or even &quot;un-married people cannot get married if they do this on a regularly basis&quot;! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I am prepared to disregard the superstitions.  \n&gt; \n&gt; What I find harder to discard though, are personal objections that I create for myself..I call it the &quot;I-am-not-worthy-enough&quot; syndrome. I am not confident of being able to stay completely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is that I do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (unselfish) enough. At some point or another won&#39;t one end up automatically asking for one&#39;s personal gains? After all, isn&#39;t it human nature to confide everything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please give my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to &#39;white-wash&#39; one&#39;s selfish motives?\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, I have to admit that after listening to some tales about regular recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with &#39;Kundalini jagran&#39;, I am a bit worried. Can sadhana and &#39;kundalini jagran&#39; ever be mutually exclusive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying only? Do they still have to undergo chakra awakening etc? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank u.\n&gt; Somanathan\n\n\n"}}
