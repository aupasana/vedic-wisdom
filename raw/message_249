I probably won&#39;t write anything \nargumentative further in this connec=\r\ntion. \n\n\nRegards,\nUtpal\n\nregards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; With all due r=\r\nespect to both Gandhiji and Yogeshwar, I completely \n&gt; disagree to this sto=\r\nry. If you look deeper Gnadhiji and Narshi \nMehta \n&gt; are poles apart. Narsi=\r\n Mehta was one of those few people who in \nthe \n&gt; path of bhakti had come t=\r\no the stage of being able to percieve and \n&gt; uderstand the real rasa-lila o=\r\nf krishna. This happens at a VERY \nVERY \n&gt; VERY advanced stage. All the nad=\r\nis in the body get cleared beyond \n&gt; the three gunas and then and only then=\r\n the energy of the soul \nflows \n&gt; throught them and rasa lila can be unders=\r\ntood happening inside the \n&gt; body. Someone who has reached this stage would=\r\n NEVER EVER in any \n&gt; birth think of anything other than this stage. It is,=\r\n they say, \nfar \n&gt; beyond anythin one can even remote imagine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gandhij=\r\ni had a different purpose, and he was a different man \n&gt; completely from Na=\r\nrsi Mehta. His aim and focus of life was \n&gt; independence struggle which he =\r\ndid fight for in his own remarkable \n&gt; way. No doubt he was a terrific pers=\r\nonality in terms of the indian \n&gt; as well as the world politcan scenario. B=\r\nut he was not really a \n&gt; spiritual saint. Unlike Narsi Mehta who was a pur=\r\ne saint and \nnothing \n&gt; else. Both have their purpose in the scheme of thin=\r\ngs and both are \n&gt; equally worthy of respect. But one is not the other at a=\r\nll! No \neven \n&gt; in any births.

I \n&gt; was reading the autobiography of a Yogi whose name is &#39;Yoges=\r\nhwar&#39;. \n&gt; he has witten his biography in Gujarati language. name of the boo=\r\nk \n&gt; is &quot;Prakash na panthe&quot;\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   He has mentioned in the book that=\r\n once he was meditating. his \n&gt; consciousness left the body and travelled t=\r\no a place where there \nwas \n&gt; a small hut at the bank of a river. one perso=\r\nn was singing, in a \n&gt; very beautiful voice. and suddenly Shri yogeshwar he=\r\nard a loud \nvoice \n&gt; which revealed that &quot;Narsinha Mehta had taken rebirth =\r\nas Mahatma \n&gt; Gandhi&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   to give a little background, Narsinha =\r\nMehta was a very revered \n&gt; Saint of Gujarat who had a great Bhakti for Lor=\r\nd Krishna. it is \nsaid \n&gt; that Krishna had taken complete responsibility of=\r\n his Yogakshem \nand \n&gt; had came to his rescue for 52 times.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   N=\r\narsinh Mehta has composed many Bhakti Git which is \n&gt; called &#39;Prabhatiya&#39; a=\r\nnd his most famous one is &quot;Vaishnav jan to \ntene \n&gt; re kahiye....&quot; which, i=\r\nntrestingly became famous worldwide becuase \n&gt; of Mahatma Gandhi.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;   thought of sharing this information with you all.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Best R=\r\negards,\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Utpal\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        \n&gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; You rock.
