Are you looking to worship the most powerful deity or th=\r\ne most real deity? I know you will reply with &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that&quot; and I kn=\r\now &quot;you don&#39;t mean that&quot;, but still ponder why the statement. V sir&#39;s deity=\r\n is ma in the form of Tara ma, but point is it still is ma, no matter what =\r\nthe form. And v sir is extremely fond of ganesh ji. You can read a bit in A=\r\nghora 2.\n\nThirdly Jitender, do a ganpathi homam, and ask Ganeshji to tell y=\r\nou a book which he thinks will lead you to more insights of him. Who said y=\r\nou can&#39;t talk to him? Next time, ask. And better still, why don&#39;t you ask h=\r\nim to tell you all about himself. And he will. Many will say , I have gone =\r\nmad to tell you the above, but do try and trust him. He will answer. All th=\r\nat is required is humble faith and sincerity. You will get your answer. And=\r\n read the Aghora books again, you will get much more insights on ganpathi t=\r\nhan roaming around here and there.\n\nP.S. next time you do a homam, do ask h=\r\nello how have you been and please tell me some books or tell me by yourself=\r\n. ;)\n\nWarm Regards,\nNobody\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jitender=\r\n Dahiya&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste to all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can somebody tel=\r\nl me another good book to read for Mahaganpati.\n&gt; Actually everywhere i hea=\r\nr only about Aghora books.\n&gt; I agree they are awesome but for when we are d=\r\noing sadhna for any deity other than Maa Samshan Tara or Chandi then, after=\r\n reading aghora trilogy a misunderstanding comes to my mind that only those=\r\n two are real or the most powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; So can some one please guide me to=\r\n some other book which gives explanation on &quot;Mahaganpati&quot; aspect of GOD.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
