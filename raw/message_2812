As Bhagavan\nwas looking into it, he saw a Tamil verse in it written by=\r\n him, long ago. It\nwas in Malayalam script, and while transcribing it into =\r\nTamil he told us its\nmeaning: =93When a man attains jnana, he will not have=\r\n any regard for this\nbody.\n\nJust as, after taking food, the leaf on which i=\r\nt was taken is thrown away\nhowever nice it may be, so also after attaining =\r\njnana one will be waiting\neagerly for the time when it can be thrown away. =\r\nThis is the essence of what\nis stated in this verse.=94\n\nHe then wrote it i=\r\nn Tamil script and began telling us further as follows:\n=93The symbol of th=\r\ne used leaf has been given by many people. However nicely a\nleaf-plate is s=\r\ntitched, it is useful only until the meal is over.\n\nAfter that will there b=\r\ne any regard for it? It is immediately thrown away.\nRich people have food o=\r\nn silver plates with gold flowers inlaid in them. Why\nare such things requi=\r\nred when we have hands given by God?\n\n=93When I was on the hill someone got=\r\n a leaf plate made of silver and\nrequested me to eat from it. I sent it bac=\r\nk saying that I did not require\nit. When the food can be eaten out of the h=\r\nands, why silver and gold? For a\nlong time I did not eat food from a leaf.\n=\r\n\nIf anybody brought food, I used to stretch out the palms of my hands and\nw=\r\nhen the food was put in them I used to eat it. It is only of late that I\nha=\r\nve begun eating food served on a leaf.=94\n\nWhen you have hands, why all the=\r\nse things? It used to be an exhilarating\nexperience in those days. When I w=\r\nas going out for bhiksha, I used to take\nthe alms in the palms of my hands =\r\nand go along the street eating it.\n\nWhen the eating was over I used to go o=\r\nn licking my hands. I never used to\ncare for anything. I used to feel shy t=\r\no ask anyone for anything. Hence that\nkarathala bhiksha (alms in the palms)=\r\n used to be very interesting.\n\nThere used to be big pundits this side and t=\r\nhat; sometimes big government\nofficials also used to be there. What did I c=\r\nare who was there?\n\nIt would be humiliating for a poor man to go out for bh=\r\niksha,but for one who\nhas conquered the ego and become an Advaiti, it is a =\r\ngreat elevation of the\nmind. At that time, he would not care if an Emperor =\r\ncame there.\n\nIn that way, when I went out for bhiksha and clapped my hands,=\r\n people used\nto say, =91Swami has come=92, and give me bhiksha with fear an=\r\nd devotion. Those\nwho did not know me used to say, =91You are strong and st=\r\nurdy.\n\nInstead of going out like this as a beggar,why don=92t you go out to=\r\n work as a\ncooly?=92 I used to feel amused. But I was a Mouna (silent) Swam=\r\ni and did not\nspeak.\n\nI used to laugh and go away feeling that it was usual=\r\n for ordinary people to\ntalk like that. The more they talked like that the =\r\nmore exhilarated I felt.\nThat was great fun.=94\n\n=93In Vasishtam, there is =\r\na story about Bhagiratha before he brought Ganges\ndown to the earth. He was=\r\n an Emperor but the empire seemed to him a great\nobstacle to atmajignasa (S=\r\nelf-enquiry).\n\nIn accordance with the advice of his Guru and on the pretext=\r\n of a yagna\n(sacrifice), he gave away all his wealth and other possessions.=\r\n\n\nNo one would, however, take the empire. So he invited the neighbouring Ki=\r\nng\nwho was an enemy and who was waiting for a suitable opportunity to snatc=\r\nh it\naway and gifted away the empire to him. The only thing that remained t=\r\no be\ndone was to leave the country.\n\nHe left at midnight in disguise, lay i=\r\nn hiding during day time in other\ncountries so as not to be recognised and =\r\nwent about begging alms at night.\nUltimately he felt confident that his min=\r\nd had matured sufficiently to be\nfree from egoism.\n\nThen he decided to go t=\r\no his native place and there went out begging in all\nthe streets. As he was=\r\n not recognised by anybody, he went one day to the\npalace itself. The watch=\r\nman recognised him, made obeisance and informed the\nthen King about it, shi=\r\nvering with fear.\n\nThe King came in a great hurry and requested him (Bhagir=\r\natha) to accept the\nkingdom back,but Bhagiratha did not agree. =93Will you =\r\ngive me alms or not?=94\nhe asked. As there was no other alternative, they g=\r\nave him alms and he went\naway highly pleased.\n\nSubsequently he became the K=\r\ning of some other country for some reason and\nwhen the King of his own coun=\r\ntry passed away, he ruled that country also at\nthe special request of the p=\r\neople. That story is given in detail in\nVasishtam.\n\nThe kingdom which earli=\r\ner appeared to him to be a burden did not trouble him\nlater when he became =\r\na Jnani. All that I want to say is, how do others know\nabout the happiness =\r\nof bhiksha? There is nothing great about begging or\neating food from a leaf=\r\n which is thrown out after taking food from it.\n\nSource: Letters from Sri R=\r\namanasramam VOLUMES I, II & Letters from and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasra=\r\nmam By SURI NAGAMMA Translated by D.
