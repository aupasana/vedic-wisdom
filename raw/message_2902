Spirituality is related too, as sp=\r\niritual sadhana improves free will and makes one freer to do the right thin=\r\ngs.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some karmas are &quot;dridha&quot; (firm or mandatory) and their results MU=\r\nST be experienced, no matter what. Throat cancer of Ramakrishna and skin ca=\r\nncer of Ramana Maharshi are examples. However, many karmas are not dridha a=\r\nnd are flexible/optional. Their results can be avoided by the application o=\r\nf free will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A regular person&#39;s free will is not strong enough to ben=\r\nd the curve of habit resulting from previous actions and change the course.=\r\n One goes with the flow, keeps on accumulating newer karmas and reaping the=\r\n good and bad fruits. One remains a slave of bad habits and those habits ge=\r\nt reinforced further and further with time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One making spiritual prog=\r\nress develops stronger free will. One starts to show better judgment and st=\r\nronger will power and does the right things despite strong obstcles. Thus, =\r\none avoids payback for a lot of undesirable karmas that are not dridha. One=\r\n also stops accumulating too many new undesirable karmas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Destiny is the sum total of karmas that one&#39;s free will perf=\r\normed in the past (including previous lives). Astrology captures one&#39;s dest=\r\niny. Destiny restrains one&#39;s free will and tries to compel free will to act=\r\n in some patterns, but free will need not obey. One always has many options=\r\n, though *tends to* select the option that is favored by destiny. But one *=\r\ncan* select another option. Strengthening judgment, wisdom and breaking fro=\r\nm bad haits is what is needed. Spiritual practices do help in that process.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; An astrologer focuses on destiny, but a spiritualist may focus on fr=\r\nee will. Destiny is water under the bridge, while free will is the new stre=\r\nam that can flow in many ways. If some yogis downplayed astrology and empha=\r\nsized free will, it is not without reason. Swami Vivekananda once famously =\r\nsaid astrology is for the weak-minded people and emphasized free will.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ahamkaara makes decisions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Buddhi makes=\r\n decisions, controlled by ahamkaara and aided by chitta. Ahamkara, chitta a=\r\nnd buddhi work closely. In computer technology terms, look at ahamkaara as =\r\na CPU, chitta as DRAM that stores all data and buddhi as an ALU or a logic =\r\nco-processor that runs logical algrithms. Manas is an I/O controller. The f=\r\nive jnanendriyas are input channels, the five karmendriyas are output chann=\r\nels; and, the five praanas are the electricity flowing in the computer. Whe=\r\nn the electricity stops flowing, CPU works in a minimal mode based on an in=\r\nternal battery until electricity is turned on again and some important data=\r\n in DRAM remains and some is lost by the time electricity is turned on agai=\r\nn. Similarly, some experiences from past lives remain in chitta as subconsc=\r\nious memories that influence our thinking in future lives, but many specifi=\r\nc memories are lost.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When buddhi makes deci=\r\nsions, it may have to process many previous memories that may be leading it=\r\n in different directions. Some memories may be conscious memories of things=\r\n from this life. Some memories may be subconscious memories of things from =\r\npast lives.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For example, one&#39;s guru may have told one &quot;never keep any=\r\nthing in mind; forgive and forget&quot; in a previous life and one may have live=\r\nd whole life following it. That ideal may be a sub-conscious memory influen=\r\ncing thinking now. If someone did terrible things to one in this life, that=\r\n may be a conscious memory now. When one is in a position to take revenge, =\r\nthere may be a clash between the two memories.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As another example, on=\r\ne may have spent a whole life trying to become a millionnaire and failed. T=\r\nhat desire may be a sub-conscious memory influencing thinking now. If one m=\r\nay be under the influence of a spiritual teacher and living a simple life o=\r\nf contentment now. But the sub-conscious memory may be clashing now and the=\r\nn with the ideals taught by guru in this life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Memories accumulated a=\r\nnd retained in chitta over lives may be guiding one in conflicting directio=\r\nns. A subjective algorithm of weighted judgment runs in buddhi. The weights=\r\n are constantly adjusted based on the history of how information is stored =\r\nin or retrieved from chitta. Free will is essentially the subjective elemen=\r\nt of buddhi, that controls this algorithm of weighted judgment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; By en=\r\ngaging in spiritual practices, by reading scriptures and spiritual teaching=\r\ns of great masters and by contemplating, we store some new useful informati=\r\non in chitta, slowly affect how information is stored to or retrieved from =\r\nchitta, and modify the relative weights of various information in chitta. W=\r\nhen the free will is strong, it is possible to overcome latent tendencies b=\r\ny storing new information in chitta and marking it as high priority.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Everybody in the spiritual path knows what are go=\r\nod tendencies and what are not. Feeling lust or desire when one sees a beau=\r\ntiful person or object is bad. Feeling anger when someone says bad things a=\r\nbout one is bad. Feeling proud about what one did or has is bad. Hanging on=\r\n to emotions is bad. And so on. Everybody knows these things. But knowing i=\r\ns not enough and one needs to act on that knowledge! The problem is that th=\r\nese things are stored in chitta with a low weight and there are overriding =\r\nmemories stored chitta with much strong weights. So it is difficult or even=\r\n impossible for the subjective portion of one&#39;s buddhi to make them win in =\r\nthe final decision-making process.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rising above firm latent tendencie=\r\ns is possible only by continuing to exert whatever little free will one has=\r\n over and over again. Slowly, free will becomes stronger and stronger and l=\r\natent tendencies become weaker and weaker. Once one breaks through the barr=\r\niers, progress is accelerated.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Practice and persistence have no subst=\r\nitutes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Do Pitri=\r\n Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Kishore Chi=\r\ntrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ass=\r\numing perfect astrological predictions, one&#39;s life should be read\n&gt; &gt; from =\r\nthe chart almost like a biography with no elaborate details in it.\n&gt; &gt; If t=\r\nhis is correct and the backdrop is set for a person, how\n&gt; &gt; does spiritual=\r\nity\n&gt; &gt; effect one&#39;s life?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is a line of thought based on this=\r\n mail:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2733\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n A person&#39;s birth time is based on that person&#39;s chitta baggage.\n&gt; &gt; Astrol=\r\nogy gives hints on person&#39;s chitta to tell the person&#39;s tendencies\n&gt; &gt; to r=\r\neact in certain conditions also a path with a set of life events like\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nirth, graduation, marriage, children, happy and sad occassions etc..\n&gt; &gt; As=\r\n every step towards next event life is a natural result of decisions\n&gt; &gt; ma=\r\nde during previous steps, the decisions to chose a path are heavily\n&gt; &gt; inf=\r\nluenced by chitta.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ahamkaara makes decisions.
