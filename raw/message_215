When chaturdasi\nprevails during the middle part (when midnight occurs), that is the\nnight during which shivarati is to be observed. Many priests are\nsimply following the dates used in India. So be it. Those who know the\ndetails can try to be more careful.\n\nIncidentally, it is not clearcut even in India. For example, some\nmembers have posted to other e-mail lists conveying that Sringeri is\ncelebrating it on the 5th, as per the word of the pontiff there.\n\nEven in the US, festivals may occasionally vary by one day between the\neast & west coasts.\n\nbhavadIyaH,\n\n       ajit\n\n\nOn Tue, Mar 4, 2008 at 5:06 PM, Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your enlightening and inspiring posts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you please clarify when we are supposed to celebrate MahaShivratri\n&gt; this year in America. I looked up in JHora and thought it was Wednesday,\n&gt; March 5. Chaturdashi starts around 3 pm EST on March 5 and ends on Thursday,\n&gt; March 6 around 2 pm EST. I assumed that you would fast and pray the night of\n&gt; March 5 but our temple priests insists that we need to celebrate it on the\n&gt; midnight of March 6, when, in fact, it will be amavasya during the entire\n&gt; night...\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks once again,\n&gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt;\n\n"}}
