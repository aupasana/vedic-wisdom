Krishna clearly says in \n=\r\n&gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone=\r\n \n&gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engag=\r\ning in the right \n&gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to person,=\r\n from time to time \n&gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what natu=\r\nre expects from you, \n&gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the =\r\npast, what actions you \n&gt; did in the past while identifying with the action=\r\n, who you affected in the \n&gt; past (and how) with the actions that you ident=\r\nified with, what debts you \n&gt; created in the process, and what mental tende=\r\nncies you accumulated until \n&gt; now.\n&gt; \n&gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendenci=\r\nes and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n&gt; to kill evil persons, that be=\r\ncomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \n&gt; tendencies and karmic debt=\r\ns, nature wants a person to spread the message of \n&gt; uniformity of all reli=\r\ngions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies a=\r\nnd karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \n&gt; ritual of homam in =\r\nthe world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendenci=\r\nes and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \n&gt; money and co=\r\nnstruct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the time=\r\n of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \n&gt; elders an=\r\nd relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight \n&gt; on ea=\r\nrth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n&gt; de=\r\nstruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, \n=\r\n&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrio=\r\nr, \n&gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and=\r\n \n&gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of \n&gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt; pre=\r\nvious life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different in this \n&gt; =\r\nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n&gt; ar=\r\nistocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \n&gt; gen=\r\nerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \n&gt; ot=\r\nhers. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n&gt; sa=\r\nid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;foll=\r\now your own dharma \n&gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castis=\r\nm. Though the concept \n&gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a =\r\nlong time, the concept of \n&gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki wa=\r\ns a shudra who lived by \n&gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a mahars=\r\nhi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a b=\r\nrahmana and and a maharshi \n&gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. =\r\nOne starts off with the varna \n&gt; of father, because that is what one is exp=\r\nosed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna =\r\nbased on what one does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words=\r\n which tells you to know your \n&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover,=\r\n there are not just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; the world. Each person has individual d=\r\nharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If on=\r\ne is pure \n&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have =\r\na part of our \n&gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounde=\r\nd by a lot of \n&gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell other thing=\r\ns. Thus, we get \n&gt; confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; We should make the best judgment combinin=\r\ng discrimination and intuition and \n&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow =\r\nit sincerely. We may err, but doing \n&gt; the best we can is all that we can d=\r\no!\n&gt; \n&gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to enga=\r\nge in \n&gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are n=\r\not \n&gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not =\r\nbuild \n&gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the =\r\nbest \n&gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in =\r\nthe given \n&gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identificati=\r\non with the \n&gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should l=\r\neave the result \n&gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happe=\r\nn now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfic=\r\nation through \n&gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our co=\r\nnsciousness slowly. \n&gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and t=\r\nell our dharma clearer. \n&gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slo=\r\nwly enable us to see our \n&gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring =\r\nnew karmas. This is not easy, \n&gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense =\r\nof \n&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action w=\r\nith \n&gt; little attachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s d=\r\nharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt; Another external in=\r\nput is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n&gt; derive one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; master. If on=\r\ne surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \n&gt; the master=\r\n to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Arjuna was co=\r\nnfused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt; and relatives=\r\n was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; dharma. When=\r\n Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; and want=\r\ned to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt; =\r\nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is not in tune with n=\r\nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; debts are and what nature=\r\n expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n&gt; one&#39;s inner core,=\r\n such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Botto=\r\nmline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n&gt; decl=\r\nare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \n&gt; t=\r\nime to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find =\r\n\n&gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one=\r\n&#39;s \n&gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiri=\r\ntual \n&gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without muc=\r\nh \n&gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understandi=\r\nng of \n&gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@....i=\r\nn&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 200=\r\n8 8:02 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i jus=\r\nt finished my Aghora series\n&gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt;&gt; Vimalanda says pat=\r\nh of dharma is very personal.\n&gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how c=\r\nan we approach\n&gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and =\r\nupanishads\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;&gt; jitender\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0118_01C9B6F1.03C6BEE0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The following nice article on dharma by R=\r\nobert \nSvoboda appeared in &quot;Times of India&quot; on April 5.

Some people he deeply \nloved and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; respected were on t=\r\nhe other side and it was his dharma to \nkill them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When th=\r\ne same Arjuna was born again in the 19th \ncentury as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda \nhad been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n previous life, according to Ramakrishna), his \ndharma was different in thi=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; new time and place. He was born to \nrenounce material life despi=\r\nte his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the \nsimple life of a monk=\r\n and inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; generations to embrace a simple life \nof mental detac=\r\nhment and service to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; others. When he is born again \n(which he has =\r\nto, as per what Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; said), his dharma based on \nthe time a=\r\nnd place may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; The tricky \nquestion is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some \npeople have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;foll=\r\now your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of=\r\n castism. Though the concept \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of caste (varna) has been there in H=\r\ninduism for a long time, the \nconcept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; caste mobility was very m=\r\nuch there. Valmiki was a shudra who \nlived by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; killing birds. He be=\r\ncame a brahmana and a maharshi later. \nVishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kshatrita=\r\n and a powerful king. He became a brahmana \nand and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lat=\r\ner. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One \nstarts off with the varna &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; of father, because that is what one is \nexposed to in childhood. As =\r\none &lt;BR&gt;&gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own \nvarna based on what one =\r\ndoes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of \nKrishna&#39;s words whic=\r\nh tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma from your caste is \nwrong. Moreove=\r\nr, there are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the world. Each person \nhas ind=\r\nividual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very \nvery=\r\n very difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s \ndha=\r\nrma. In fact, all of us have a part of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind that tells us what=\r\n \nour dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; noise from other=\r\n parts \nof our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; confuse=\r\nd.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We should make the best judgment combining discriminat=\r\nion and intuition \nand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sin=\r\ncerely. We may err, but \ndoing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the best we can is all that we can =\r\ndo!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; More than \nfollowing dharma, what is of utmost importa=\r\nnce is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions \nwithout identification. *That* alone =\r\nensures that we are not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not increas=\r\ning the load. We should not build \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; too much attachment to what we =\r\nare doing. We should engage in the best \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible actions (based o=\r\nn our best judgment on what our dharma in the \ngiven &lt;BR&gt;&gt; situation is)=\r\n, with as little attachment and self-identification \nwith the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; acti=\r\non as possible. When the action is finished, we should \nleave the result &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will \nhappen now&quot;, &quot;wi=\r\nll it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga \n(unficatio=\r\nn through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify \nour=\r\n consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we become purer, our mind will work \nsha=\r\nrper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a positive feedback her=\r\ne. \nThis will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma clearly and follo=\r\nw it \nwithout incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but not as d=\r\nifficult as \npeople think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bottomline is: Even if one =\r\nis not following \none&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot;=\r\n gets refined with time \nif one engages in action with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; little atta=\r\nchment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In deciding one&#39;=\r\ns \ndharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Another e=\r\nxternal \ninput is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n derive one&#39;s \ndharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritua=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; master. \nIf one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take t=\r\nhe words of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \nmaster to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it si=\r\nncerely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When \nArjuna was confused about what his dharma w=\r\nas and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nand relatives was not dharma, he had=\r\n a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma. When Narendranath (S=\r\nwami Vivekananda) was confused about his \ndharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and wanted to ren=\r\nounce the world and go to a secluded place to \ndo sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to \nstay in the material &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One who is =\r\nnot in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what \none&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ndebts are and what nature expects from one can err in the \njudgment of what=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul \nwith a clear =\r\ninsight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give \nperfect guida=\r\nnce.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline is \nthat =\r\nI (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; declare that=\r\n \nas the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ti=\r\nme to \ntime and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; out \nwhat one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding=\r\n of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \ndharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various =\r\nkinds of spiritual \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging i=\r\nn actions without much \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself =\r\nand refine one&#39;s \nunderstanding of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best \nregards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a \nShort Homam Your=\r\nself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSpirituality: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nFree Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nFree Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n=\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJaga=\r\nnnath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n-----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Origin=\r\nal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:dahiya=\r\njiten@...&quot;&gt;dahiyajiten@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nTo: &lt;&lt;A \nhre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] \nDharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; i just \nfinished my Aghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nVimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Ca=\r\nn somebody share \nviews on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; towards=\r\n it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it \nhas to do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \nregards&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; jitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0118_01C9B6F1.03C6BEE0--\r\n\n"}}
