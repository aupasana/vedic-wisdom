It is either this or that=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Both are correct, but at different levels. I will elaborate.\nHowe=\r\nver, this is philosophically complex and those who do not follow\nwhat I say=\r\n should not worry at all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Non-dual self has no divisi=\r\non of self into various objects or space\nor time. There is no concept of ti=\r\nme or space or space-time continuum\nwithin non-dual self. A yogi absorbed i=\r\nn non-dual self has no sense of\nspace or time or objectification.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nupreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non-duality.\nSupreme co=\r\nsmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the entire\nfield of duali=\r\nty within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time\ncontinua within =\r\nthe field of duality exist within Him. From the\nperspective of supreme cosm=\r\nic being, all beings of the dual world are\nHis parts and all their individu=\r\nal wills are parts of His cosmic will.\nAs all space-time continua are withi=\r\nn Him, there is nothing that is\nunknown to Him. Past, present and future; h=\r\nere, there and everywhere; I,\nyou and others, this possibility, that possib=\r\nility and yet another\npossibility - all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to=\r\n His\nself-awareness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, let us come lower and into the field of d=\r\nuality. The field of\nduality consists of infinite divisions of space, time =\r\nand space-time\ncontinua. There are infinite possibilities within this field=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within duality have a linear sense =\r\nof\ntime and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. However,\nfiel=\r\nd of duality also contains planes of consciousness where different\nsenses o=\r\nf time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at\nvarious poi=\r\nnts) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time\ncontinuum in such a pl=\r\nane of consciousness may experience a point of\ntime that maps to a future t=\r\nime in a regular space-time continuum being\nexperienced by you. Also, what =\r\nis 1 minute in one space-time continuum\nmay be 1 year in another space-time=\r\n continuum. Time is not as\nstraight-forward an entity as one may think. Bas=\r\nically, the field of\nduality contains infinite space-time continua and what=\r\n one experiences\ndepends on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s self-awar=\r\neness\n(Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a specific\nspac=\r\ne-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality. But\nrelaity=\r\n\n&gt; consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each other.\nThes=\r\ne are all different possibilities and you chart out your course\nbased on yo=\r\nur actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom the perspective of a yogi who is in a different space-time\ncontinuum, yo=\r\nur state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as per\nthe space-time c=\r\nontinuum in which you exist. But, from the perspective\nof the space-time co=\r\nntinuum that you are in, your state at that future\ntime is not yet known an=\r\nd depends on your current action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a yogi in a different space-ti=\r\nme continuum has seen your state in\nfuture, his observation is merely an ob=\r\nservation and from his reference\nframe. It has no causal relationship to yo=\r\nur current action or your\nfuture state. He is merely an observer and he doe=\r\ns not cause anything to\nhappen. His observation is specific to some space-t=\r\nime pairs and does\nnot cover all the space-time pairs that you will travers=\r\ne as you travel\nto reach the space-time pair where he observed you (if at a=\r\nll you do!).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let us go further. Is there only one fut=\r\nure possible for you? Or,\ndoes the path traversed by you in space-time cont=\r\ninuum not fixed but\nvariable based on your actions? Can your actions at imp=\r\nortant\ncross-roads alter the course you traverse?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If so, what is th=\r\ne meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time\npair? Is his observation =\r\nonly a possibility or a certainty? One may say\n&quot;how can one observe a possi=\r\nbility? Anything we observe must be a\ncertainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren=\r\n&#39;t the field of duality and the\ninfinite space-time continua contained in i=\r\nt merely a set of infinite\npossibilities?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some great rishis can see=\r\n not just a space-time pair, but many\nspace-time continua at the same time,=\r\n i.e. they can see various\npossibilities based on various possible actions.=\r\n However, visions seen\nby most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one possibilit=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, there =\r\nis certainly\nsomething called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by the =\r\nreactions\ngiven by nature to your own previous actions, you do have a scope=\r\n for\nengaging in different actions at this time. Depending on which action\n=\r\nyou engage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions can\neven =\r\nmake the future significantly different. A rishi may be able to\nchart out a=\r\n significant portion of the field of possibilities for future\n(e.g. like a =\r\nbrilliant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto\n20 moves from n=\r\now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few\npossibilities for future (e.=\r\ng. like a good chess player figuring out a\nfew moves or guessing a future p=\r\nosition). But the supreme cosmic being\nknows the entire field of possibilit=\r\nies, as they all exist within Him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, your actions are what b=\r\nring to fruition (w.r.t. the\nreference frame of your consciousness! ) some =\r\nof those possibilities.\nOne may know all the possibilities quite deeply and=\r\n even guess the\npossibility that will come to fruition, but it is your acti=\r\nons that\nactually make some of those possibilities a reality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Me=\r\nssage -----\n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] F=\r\nreewill.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspi=\r\nring mail for all of us, however, I\ncould not help it that an inevitable qu=\r\nestion popped up in my mind.

He di=\r\nd not know much about some of the ten\nincarnations. He described what he sa=\r\nw and I told him who was who and a\nlittle about them.

But, when I was\nwith him=\r\n one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was\nabou a week =\r\nafter the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I asked what he was =\r\nthinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future\nthat is to come has not alrea=\r\ndy happened. It has already happened in\nreality, but it will happen later w=\r\nhen the time comes. You know what I\nmean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at=\r\n, but pretended not to know. I\nsaid, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He sai=\r\nd, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is\nnot known to b=\r\ne overly intelligent or articulate. His main\ncharacteristic is that he is u=\r\nsually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind,\ncontented and relaxed. However, he w=\r\nas onto something today. But he\ncould not express himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I helped=\r\n him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened\nat some level, b=\r\nut will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a\nmovie. A movie may ha=\r\nve been shot and become ready in a studio. Some\npeople may have already see=\r\nn it. But people seeing it on the screen\nlater will think it is happening i=\r\nn front of them. Are you saying\nsomething like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He exclaimed,=\r\n &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is\ngoing to happen in fut=\r\nure, it will happen when future comes. But\nsomebody may be able to see it b=\r\nefore future comes, because it has\nalready happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though he did=\r\n not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these\nlines. When I told =\r\nhim the man riding the horse in his vision over the\nfire was Kalki and he w=\r\nas yet to come, he was probably confused. Given\nhis age and ability to thin=\r\nk and understand things, this probably seemed\nlike an oddity to him that he=\r\n should see somebody who had not yet come.\nSo he was trying to think how it=\r\n was possible and came to some important\nconclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his ow=\r\nn way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. How=\r\never, in\nmany planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed=\r\n.

Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before tha=\r\nt.\nOnce I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to=\r\n\nmy guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was\nwhen=\r\n I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya\nof a fa=\r\nmous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol\nthere, which w=\r\nas sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past.\nThe energy I fel=\r\nt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other\ntime did I feel that=\r\n intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and op=\r\nened eyes, that\nboy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far,=\r\n this is the\nbestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to=\r\n say it,\nbut it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than\nwhat I gi=\r\nve in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a\npowerful en=\r\nergy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity\nis the most imp=\r\nortant thing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a rit=\r\nual better and\nget more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one=\r\n has to keep\ndoing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Keep performing you=\r\nr chosen spiritual practices, but do pay\nattention to internal purity as yo=\r\nu engage in external practices. The\nonly worthwhile measure of spiritual pr=\r\nogress and purity is how smaller\nyour ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, =\r\nyou can resist attraction to\nexternal things better and you can resist inte=\r\nrnal enemies like lust,\nanger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma b=\r\netter. Ego - thinking\nthat this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cau=\r\nse of all problems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga =\r\nis relatively challenging, but\nbhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that i=\r\ns around you - including\nyour house, money, cars, spouse, children and your=\r\n own body - is god&#39;s\nproperty and that you are a temporary caretaker of all=\r\n of these\nproperties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertain=\r\ning the\nnotion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of h=\r\nis\nmaster&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as his or\n=\r\nher belongings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not ne=\r\ncessary for\ntaking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master take=\r\ns the\nbest care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a\ns=\r\nervant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept\nthat =\r\nis master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables\none to do =\r\nthe best job with what one possesses and not worry about what\none does not =\r\npossess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of=\r\n a servant who takes care of master&#39;s\nproperties will help one wade the oce=\r\nan of worldly life without getting\ncaught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\ntarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! recommends that you upgrade to the new and safer Intern=\r\net\nExplorer 8. http://downloads.yahoo.com/in/internetexplorer/\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--8-9810932796-7162738372=:2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste Rajarshri ji,&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#007f40&quot;&gt;Something m=\r\noving at an extremely fast pace does not observe space-time as you or I do.=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#007f40&quot;&gt;There are a set of =\r\nparticles called Tachyons which move at speeds greater than that of light a=\r\nnd whole of cause and effect gets reversed for them.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#007f40&quot;&gt;So this idea of linear cause followed by e=\r\nffect makes sense only here, and this cannot be superimposed on other frame=\r\ns of reference, where the question itself may breakdown.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;Wow, this is such a lovely mail. &lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Now carrying this forward in some kind of a fant=\r\nasy world (of which one has no direct &quot;real&quot; experience)...is it that the g=\r\nrosser (impure) we are, the slower we move in respect to light (god?)? ...t=\r\nhe more lighter (pure) we become, the more closer we could move&nbsp;in res=\r\npect of light?...and then we can perhaps &quot;jump&quot; the space-time duality....t=\r\nhe way the young boy jumped it while looking&nbsp; into the fire during hom=\r\nam?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;karma / destiny&nbsp;applies only in a dualisti=\r\nc framework, isn&#39;t it?...or the time-space dimension that we presently live=\r\n in?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;As for free will ... is&#39;nt there some relation=\r\nship between this and quantum mechanics where if the position of the partic=\r\nle is &quot;pinned down&quot; the speed of the particle cannot be determined and vice=\r\n versa???

What is the co=\r\nmmon sense understanding, but one gained from observation of life uptill th=\r\ne age of say 18!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Something moving at an extremely fa=\r\nst pace does not observe space-time as you or I do. Inside an atom there is=\r\n not a well defined path for a electron to revolve around. but merely cloud=\r\ns of probability ! Which means what someone can say at best is the probabil=\r\nity of finding an electron at a certain distance from the nucleus, only a p=\r\nrobability.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And all these have been derived from har=\r\ndcore mathematical process. Not just speculations. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nAfter reading Narasimhaji&#39;s mail I realized the problem arises because of t=\r\nhe structure of our commonsense at this reference frame. That is why when w=\r\ne are here, this theoritical problem arises, but say you become the supreme=\r\n being, the problem itself does not exist. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There ar=\r\ne a set of particles called Tachyons which move at speeds greater than that=\r\n of light and whole of cause and effect gets reversed for them. That is, th=\r\ne effect precedes the cause in a universe where the things happen faster th=\r\nan the speed of light. In such a place one would probably get the results o=\r\nf an exam even before one appears for the exam!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; So t=\r\nhis idea of linear cause followed by effect makes sense only here, and this=\r\n cannot be superimposed on other frames of reference, where the question it=\r\nself may breakdown.Thus the idea of God having fixed everything may not mak=\r\ne any sense to God, but creates a lot of theoritical confusion for us. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not sure if I have been able to convey what I was =\r\ntrying, I just made an attempt.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nb=\r\nsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is =\r\nBhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 2/7/09, utpal pathak ve=\r\ndic_pathak@... wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: utpal pathak vedic_pa=\r\nthak@...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Freewill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, 2 July, 2009, 11:49 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Na=\r\nmaste Narasimha garu,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are few things from your messa=\r\nge which i am trying to link for clearly understanding this puzzel of free/=\r\nfix will.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) &gt;there is nothing that is unknown to Him. =\r\nPast, present and future; &gt;here, there and everywhere; I, you and others=\r\n, this possibility, &gt;that possibility and yet another possibility - all =\r\nare accessible &gt;and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; 2)&gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, there is certainly &gt=\r\n;something called &quot;freewill&quot;.

BUT please explain to me about the supreme cosmic being who is a sole l=\r\nink between Dual and Non-dual self. now as you have mentioned (pl. refer to=\r\n no.1 above) he is all knower so every possibility is known to him and not =\r\nonly every possibility but even every action going to be taken in a perticu=\r\nlar Space-time zone and what the eventual result. we call him by Naraayana/=\r\nShiva/ Bhagavati/ GOD/Allah/ Ganapati (As per Atharvashirsh) and many such =\r\nnames depending on our faiths. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The point no.1 indicates t=\r\nhat HE is all knower and point no.2 indicates that Free will is certainly t=\r\nhere at our Spac-time level.

It is either this or =\r\nthat.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Both are correct, but at different levels.=\r\n I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically complex and those who d=\r\no not follow what I say should not worry at all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Non-dual self has no division of self int=\r\no various objects or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or=\r\n space-time continuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual sel=\r\nf has no sense of space or time or objectification.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non-duality. Supre=\r\nme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the entire field of =\r\nduality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time continua wi=\r\nthin the field of duality exist within Him. From the perspective of supreme=\r\n cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are His parts and all their ind=\r\nividual wills are parts of His cosmic will. As all space-time continua are =\r\nwithin Him, there is nothing that is unknown to Him. Past, present and futu=\r\nre; here, there and everywhere; I, you and others, this possibility, that p=\r\nossibility and yet another possibility - all are accessible and fully &quot;know=\r\nn&quot; to His self-awareness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, let us come lower=\r\n and into the field of duality. The field of duality consists of infinite d=\r\nivisions of space, time and space-time continua. There are infinite possibi=\r\nlities within this field.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Normally, people stuck=\r\n deeply within duality have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part=\r\n of one space-time continuum. However, field of duality also contains plane=\r\ns of consciousness where different senses of time and different space-time =\r\ncontinua (that may intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experienc=\r\nes such a space-time continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experie=\r\nnce a point of time that maps to a future time in a regular space-time cont=\r\ninuum being experienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time co=\r\nntinuum may be 1 year in another space-time continuum. Time is not as strai=\r\nght-forward an entity as one may think. Basically, the field of duality con=\r\ntains infinite space-time continua and what one experiences depends on the =\r\nplane of consciousness that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, mo=\r\nst of us experience part of a specific space-time continuum and hence think=\r\n that that is the only reality. But relaity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consists of infinite sp=\r\nace-time continua that intersect each other. These are all different possib=\r\nilities and you chart out your course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s re=\r\nactions to your actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is in a different space-time c=\r\nontinuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as per the =\r\nspace-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspective of the s=\r\npace-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future time is not =\r\nyet known and depends on your current action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If=\r\n a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state in future, =\r\nhis observation is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It h=\r\nas no causal relationship to your current action or your future state. He i=\r\ns merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen. His observat=\r\nion is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-t=\r\nime pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair=\r\n where he observed you (if at all you do!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Let us go further. Is there only one future po=\r\nssible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you in space-time continuum =\r\nnot fixed but variable based on your actions? Can your actions at important=\r\n cross-roads alter the course you traverse?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If s=\r\no, what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his=\r\n observation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can one ob=\r\nserve a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that =\r\ncorrect? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua c=\r\nontained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Some great rishis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space=\r\n-time continua at the same time, i.e. they can see various possibilities ba=\r\nsed on various possible actions. However, visions seen by most yogis about =\r\n&quot;future&quot; are just one possibility.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, there is ce=\r\nrtainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by the react=\r\nions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do have a scope for =\r\nengaging in different actions at this time. Depending on which action you e=\r\nngage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions can even make =\r\nthe future significantly different. A rishi may be able to chart out a sign=\r\nificant portion of the field of possibilities for future (e.g. like a brill=\r\niant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 moves from now). =\r\nAn advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for future (e.g. li=\r\nke a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing a future positi=\r\non). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of possibilities, =\r\nas they all exist within Him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, your acti=\r\nons are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your consciou=\r\nsness! ) some of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilities qu=\r\nite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come to fruition, but i=\r\nt is your actions that actually make some of those possibilities a reality.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarp=\r\nana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast.=\r\n net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nn nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subjec=\r\nt: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimh=\r\naji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for =\r\nall of us, however, I could not help it that an inevitable question popped =\r\nup in my mind.

But then if t=\r\nhe Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then such a self corr=\r\necting option is already negated out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, theo=\r\nritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any choice in the sense tha=\r\nt finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@ wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity and overcoming ego&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 J=\r\nune, 2009, 6:01 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very s=\r\nhort Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the f=\r\nollowing mail:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom/message/ 761&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This boy was born and =\r\nbrought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did=\r\n not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw=\r\n and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he sa=\r\nw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road=\r\n. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going =\r\nand smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some s=\r\nerious thought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the abo=\r\nve mail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, =\r\n&quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already happened. It has=\r\n already happened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes.=\r\n You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not=\r\n to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He sai=\r\nd, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to b=\r\ne overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is u=\r\nsually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he w=\r\nas onto something today. But he could not express himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happen=\r\ned at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a mo=\r\nvie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people m=\r\nay have already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will thin=\r\nk it is happening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. =\r\nIf something is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes=\r\n. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has al=\r\nready happened.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I=\r\n knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding=\r\n the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he=\r\n was probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand t=\r\nhings, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebo=\r\ndy who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and =\r\ncame to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. Ho=\r\nwever, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes change=\r\nd. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or =\r\nBrahman or Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama m=\r\nantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were m=\r\neditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It =\r\nwas quite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy ma=\r\nde my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely ex=\r\npressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time t=\r\no leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I had ex=\r\nperienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experie=\r\nnced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish w=\r\nho was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpec=\r\nted opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, stan=\r\nding within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and=\r\n worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on=\r\n all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and =\r\nopened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so fa=\r\nr, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how =\r\nto say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and=\r\n short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like h=\r\ne was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline=\r\n is that internal purity is the most important thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and g=\r\net more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doi=\r\nng it until one breaks through.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Keep performing =\r\nyour chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as=\r\n you engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual=\r\n progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smalle=\r\nr, you can resist attraction to external things better and you can resist i=\r\nnternal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharm=\r\na better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root =\r\ncause of all problems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bha=\r\nkti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including your hous=\r\ne, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and =\r\nthat you are a temporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do th=\r\ne best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A f=\r\naithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s properties, but withou=\r\nt thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for tak=\r\ning good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care=\r\n of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does not=\r\n waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s pro=\r\nperty and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job wi=\r\nth what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or what=\r\n is out of one&#39;s control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Developing the attitud=\r\ne of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the=\r\n ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yahoo! recommends that you upgrade to the new and=\r\n safer Internet Explorer 8. http://downloads.yahoo.com/in/internetexplorer/=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--8-9810932796-7162738372=:2--\r\n\n"}}
