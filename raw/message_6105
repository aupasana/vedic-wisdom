This district of\nIshinomaki still has=\r\n no electricity, tap water or gas.\n\n&quot;I\ndon&#39;t read newspapers, I don&#39;t liste=\r\nn to the radio. They are talking about\nhorrible things,&quot; Suzuki, who has be=\r\nen a widow for years, says as she\nprepares to sleep on the second floor of =\r\nher house.\n\n&quot;Why do\nI have to know more when I&#39;ve seen enough myself?&quot;\n\nShe=\r\n wakes up\nas the sun rises. She goes downstairs to clear rubble left by the=\r\n tsunami that\nsmashed into the ground floor on March 11 and heaped tragedy =\r\non this quiet town\nin Miyagi prefecture.\n\nIt was a day\nwhen in Miyagi a man=\r\n felt his mother&#39;s hand slip out of his tight grasp, three\nchildren watched=\r\n their mother being washed away, and an elderly couple vanished\nwith their =\r\ngrandchild, their three bodies later found.\n\nSuzuki\nclears the debris insid=\r\ne her house, which was hit by a wave that at this point\nwas two metres (six=\r\n feet) high, against the sound of a helicopter overhead that\nis carrying aw=\r\nay newly retrieved bodies.\n\nMud covers\nfamily photos and other keepsakes, a=\r\nnd the smell of rotten seawater with fish\nand kelp fills the air.\n\nIn the\nn=\r\neighbourhood, overturned cars and ships lie scattered on the roads and in\no=\r\nther people&#39;s gardens. People walk under a car that is stuck between two\nbu=\r\nildings like a bridge.\n\nSuzuki&#39;s\nmost important mission is not to clear up =\r\nrubble but to find her 41-year-old\ndaughter, who has been missing since the=\r\n day of the disaster.\n\nSuzuki was\nin the city of Sendai, some 60 kilometres=\r\n (37 miles) away from her home town,\nwhen the 9.0-magnitude quake struck be=\r\nneath the sea floor.\n\nShe managed\nto return home on the afternoon of the fo=\r\nllowing day, having shared a taxi from\nSendai to a place near Ishinomaki an=\r\nd then walked through knee-deep water amid\nfloating bodies for seven hours.=\r\n\n\nWhen she got\nhome, her daughter was not in the house they have shared.\n\n&quot;=\r\nI\nfailed to die,&quot; Suzuki says as she ponders her pain.\n\nThrowing\naway her t=\r\natami mats, fridge, TV sets and furniture means nothing compared with\nthe a=\r\ngony of searching for her daughter, she says.\n\nWhenever she\nspots earth-mov=\r\ning machinery clearing a mountain of rubble to the side of a\nroad, she trai=\r\nls it. &quot;Please, please do it gently. My daughter may be in\nthere,&quot; she asks=\r\n the driver.\n\nThe body of\nanother, elderly woman was indeed found in the de=\r\nbris of a nearby supermarket.\n\nMany who are\nsearching for their loved ones =\r\nhave experienced the painful process of feeling\ntheir hopes whittled down s=\r\nlowly, day by day.\n\nThey\ninitially hope that the person is unhurt, then the=\r\ny think he or she isn&#39;t home\nor is at a shelter, or has been injured and ho=\r\nspitalised.\n\nAfter they\nlearn that the person&#39;s name is not on the lists of=\r\n inpatients at hospitals,\nthey are left with the hope the person is in a co=\r\nma and therefore cannot be\ncontacted. Finally, their wish becomes only to f=\r\nind the person&#39;s body.\n\nFamilies\nvisit makeshift morgues to find the last t=\r\nhing they want to see.\n\nThere are\nlists of bodies, all numbered.\n\nSome are\n=\r\nidentified by the name on the papers they carried, others are anonymous and=\r\n\ndescribed only in sparse phrases such as &quot;a female in her 30s. Height\nabou=\r\nt 160cm&quot; or &quot;about three years old&quot;.\n\nWhen you\ngive the police the number o=\r\nf the body you want to see, you are shown its\npictures.\n\nIf you think\nit is=\r\n the person you are looking for, you are led into a hall where rows of\nbodi=\r\nes are laid out in plain-wood coffins or plastic bags, with the smell of\nbu=\r\nrning incense sticks in the air.\n\nPeople weep\nas they find a person they ha=\r\nve cared for dearly or shared their lives with,\nnow a stiff body with drenc=\r\nhed hair, naked and in a blanket following their\nautopsy.\n\nIn the\nnearby to=\r\nwn of Higashimatsushima, a young couple sits by a coffin, which seems\ntoo b=\r\nig for their dead baby inside. They are in utter silence, staring vacantly\n=\r\ninto space.\n\nA line of\nrelatives passes another coffin, and one says to the=\r\n lifeless body inside:\n&quot;The way you held out is great!&quot;\n\nIdentical\nmemos, h=\r\nandwritten in large red letters, are left on two coffins lying side by\nside=\r\n.\n\nThe notes\nread, &quot;Please make sure the daughter is buried next to her mot=\r\nher&quot;.\nThey are both signed by a man who has identified the corpses as those=\r\n of his\nwife and daughter.\n\nAt a morgue\nin Ishinomaki, photos of hundreds o=\r\nf unidentified bodies are taped to big blue\ntarpaulins, visible to all who =\r\ncome.\n\nFamilies are\ndumbstruck as they see images of faces that have turned=\r\n red or black. Most\nbodies have their eyes closed, their mouths half open, =\r\nand their wet hair\nslicked back.\n\n&quot;You\nwere here, dad!,&quot; a middle-aged woma=\r\nn says when she spots a man&#39;s picture,\ndropping to her knees. &quot;Welcome back=\r\n, dad. Welcome back!&quot;, she\ncontinues, stroking the picture.\n\nAs many of\nthe=\r\n victims are elderly, children are proving easier to find.\n\nBut pictures\nof=\r\n some children have been flapping in the cold wind for days, raising the\nwo=\r\nrst fears about the fate of their parents.\n\n&quot;I was\nvery scared to see the b=\r\nodies initially, but I needed to get used to it,&quot;\nSuzuki says, steeling her=\r\nself for another grim search.\n\nShe cannot\nerase from her mind the sight of =\r\nrecovered bodies she saw at the town hall near\nher house, among them small =\r\nbrothers still hugging each other, and a mother\nclutching her child to her =\r\nbreast in a mortal embrace.\n\n&quot;I was\nborn and grew up by the sea,&quot; says Suzu=\r\nki, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to see\nthe ocean any more.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1357182031-1301669051=:13455\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1099391112&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv109=\r\n9391112bodyDrftID&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1099391112&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; c=\r\nellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=3D&quot;yiv1099391112drftMsgContent&quot; style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-hei=\r\nght: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-family=\r\n: arial; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv1099391112MsoNor=\r\nmal&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv1099391112MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv1099391112MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\nA\nmother&#39;s search in post-tsunami Japan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv109939=\r\n1112MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv1099391112MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;2011-03-31\n11:22 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;by Miwa\nSuzuki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 1=\r\n0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;ISHINOMAKI,\nMarch =\r\n31, 2011 (AFP) - Thousands of families are missing loved ones almost\nthree =\r\nweeks after a powerful earthquake and tsunami devastated towns and lives\nal=\r\nong Japan&#39;s northeast coast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;=\r\n&quot;&gt;One of them\nis the family of this AFP reporter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This is the\nstory of Takako Suzuki, 67, who is still=\r\n searching for a sign of life from her\ndaughter, this reporter&#39;s sister, am=\r\nid the ruins of the small fishing port she\nhas called home all her life.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Every\nevening Suzuki slips un=\r\nder the quilt of her futon shortly after sunset around\n7:00 pm because ther=\r\ne is nothing to do in the pitch darkness.
