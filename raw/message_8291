Established by =\r\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya in May of 2012, the CSDC brings together seve=\r\nral of the most prominent Hindu scholars in America with the singular purpo=\r\nse of academically affirming the preeminence of the philosophy, practice an=\r\nd culture of Sanatana Dharma in the intellectual realm. \n\nThe Board of Advi=\r\nsors for this first ever Hindu think tank includes:\n\nDr. David Frawley, Pro=\r\nfessor Subhash Kak, Professor Ramdas Lamb, Professor Ramesh Rao, Professor =\r\nParmender Mehta, and Professor Daniel Wilkins.\n\nOur goal is to reveal to th=\r\ne world the unique Vedic perspective on all of the most important philosoph=\r\nical, social, religious, political and cultural issues of the day. We will =\r\noffer comparative analyses of the Dharma world-view versus every other worl=\r\nd-view of prominence in the 21st century, thus establishing Sanatana Dharma=\r\n as the philosophical system par excellence designed to solve the many cris=\r\nes and confusions that our world is facing today.\n\nSeeking Paper Submission=\r\ns\n\nWe are seeking papers to publish on our website, and that may eventually=\r\n be published in printed form.\n\nWe are exclusively interested in papers tha=\r\nt firmly contrast any civilizational aspect of Sanatana Dharma with any jux=\r\ntaposing aspect of a non-Dharmic belief system, theological stance, philoso=\r\nphy, ideology, or idea. The goal of your paper must be to demonstratively e=\r\nstablish the preeminence of Sanatana Dharma over the non-Dharmic philosophi=\r\ncal proposition you are comparing it to. We are not interested in purely hi=\r\nstorical, hagiographical, philological, or needlessly abstract papers =96 b=\r\nut only papers that directly interface Sanatana Dharma with modernity in a =\r\npolemically engaged manner.\n\nYou can submit papers online at: http://dharma=\r\ncivilization.com/submissions/\n\nWe Need Your Help\n\nThe CSDC is currently ope=\r\nrating on a limited budget. We will need further funding for larger office =\r\nspace rental, internet development and maintenance, possible fellowships fo=\r\nr scholars who we would want to employ full-time, development of multimedia=\r\n production capacity, etc. If you would like to donate to this important ca=\r\nuse, please do so by visiting: http://dharmacivilization.com/donate/\n\nAum T=\r\nat Sat\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
