Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book o=\r\nf rituals/history/ or even dharma, but probably a testimony of the various =\r\nspiritual realities on the path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/all=\r\negorical verses. A\n=C2=A0\nSwami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During=\r\n his last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the =\r\ninterpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his=\r\n opinion, not upto the mark.

Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses an=\r\nd in future, and that=C2=A0someone has to come up with a more holistic and =\r\ndeeper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence t=\r\nhat Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed=\r\n him on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up=\r\n with a=C2=A0new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns of Agni.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n21.

Let almighty help to pres=\r\nerve knowledge uncorrupted.\n=C2=A0\nThere are different homam proceudures fo=\r\nllowed by different paramparas in different parts of India. I am sure none =\r\nof them is incorrect. The final=C2=A0judge of the success of any sustained =\r\nsadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. =\r\nIf the sadhana is making the sadhaka=C2=A0more detached,=C2=A0etc etc,the s=\r\nadhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed.=C2=A0It is not the num=\r\nber of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally the internal tran=\r\nsformations that you experience which are crucial. There are people who fol=\r\nlow a million rules of procedure for performing various rituals and yet nev=\r\ner experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations=\r\n. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. =\r\nWhatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In=\r\n this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable s=\r\nadhanas, which when done regularly=C2=A0helps to\n transform an individual. =\r\nMany have experienced the same, many more will in the=C2=A0future.

I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from J=\r\nyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not =\r\nthe right forum for discussing these topics.\n\nI have gone through the homam=\r\n manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performe=\r\nd and have the following observations to make.\n\n1. As per rules laid out by=\r\n srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various ritual=\r\ns, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is=\r\n the prakruti of all yajnas).\n\n2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be th=\r\nere in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but i=\r\nt has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which ar=\r\ne not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by achary=\r\nas.\n\n3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as =\r\napastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n\n=\r\n4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worth=\r\ny of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. T=\r\nhen only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual=\r\n&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal t=\r\no get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n\n5. The procedure in th=\r\ne manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviation=\r\ns and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n\n6. =\r\nIn paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular =\r\nmanner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom =\r\nof the prceeding ones.\n\n7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra paris=\r\nhkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from S=\r\nE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas=\r\n. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaad=\r\ni eeshaantam).\n\n8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in t=\r\nhe vessel above darbha is missing.\n\n9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam f=\r\nor purification of the utensils is missing.\n\n10. Patra samskaram or purifyi=\r\nng the utensils is missing.\n\n11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on pra=\r\nneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) i=\r\ns missing.\n\n12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n\n13=\r\n. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the hom=\r\na dravya used for havan is missing.\n\n14. Darvee samskaram or purification o=\r\nf ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sru=\r\nksruvou) .\n\n15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n\n16. Idhm=\r\na pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing=\r\n.\n\n17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the g=\r\nhee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to=\r\n be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n\nand many mo=\r\nre ............\n\n18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is=\r\n not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carri=\r\ner for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronou=\r\nnced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If =\r\nat all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n\n18. In t=\r\nhe tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts=\r\n either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into=\r\n the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.=\r\n\n\n19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastr=\r\na (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t invol=\r\nve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunc=\r\niation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who pe=\r\nrform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for a=\r\nny devata.\n\n20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out=\r\n that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru a=\r\nnd practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n\n21. I suggest that we=\r\n preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not alway=\r\ns yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-536882524-1277052764=:78249\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Sindhu ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot; class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I was not refer=\r\nring to the article of Frits Staal, but the book written by him called &quot;Agn=\r\ni&quot;,Please go through it if you get a chance.

He had written a huge, lengthy article on why and how mantras are not=\r\nhing but sounds of birds and bees which were aped by ancient people, and th=\r\ney are supposed to have neither meaning nor sense! A person with such a sha=\r\nllow understanding of the spiritual essence of Sanatana Dharma, cannot be e=\r\nxpected to&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;the spiritual essence&nbsp;and depth of &quot;Agn=\r\ni&quot;. Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book of rituals/history/ or eve=\r\nn dharma, but probably a testimony of the various spiritual realities on th=\r\ne path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/allegorical verses. A&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Swami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During hi=\r\ns last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the int=\r\nerpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his op=\r\ninion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas re=\r\nally are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses and i=\r\nn future, and that&nbsp;someone has to come up with a more holistic and dee=\r\nper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence that=\r\n Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed hi=\r\nm on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up wi=\r\nth a&nbsp;new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns of Agni.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of=\r\n knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Le=\r\nt almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There are different homam proceudures followed by differ=\r\nent paramparas in different parts of India. I am sure none of them is incor=\r\nrect. The final&nbsp;judge of the success of any sustained sadhana like a h=\r\noma is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. If the sadhana i=\r\ns making the sadhaka&nbsp;more detached,&nbsp;etc etc,the sadhana is workin=\r\ng. If not, more hard work is needed.&nbsp;It is not the number of rules tha=\r\nt you add or substract, but it is finally the internal transformations that=\r\n you experience which are crucial. There are people who follow a million ru=\r\nles of procedure for performing various rituals and yet never experienced e=\r\nven a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations. What use is su=\r\nch rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. Whatever helps a=\r\n sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In this light, the=\r\n homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable sadhanas, which w=\r\nhen\n done regularly&nbsp;helps to transform an individual. Many have experi=\r\nenced the same, many more will in the&nbsp;future.

I had posted=\r\n a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;effic=\r\nacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for disc=\r\nussing these topics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have gone through the homam manual provided b=\r\ny Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have the fol=\r\nlowing observations to make.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. As per rules laid out by srouta and =\r\ngruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna=\r\n (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakrut=\r\ni of all yajnas).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in=\r\n the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has =\r\nto be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not =\r\nessential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. There are variations\n in procedures in the different sutras such as=\r\n apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. becom=\r\ne worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right proce=\r\ndure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire=\r\n ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits =\r\nStaal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. The pr=\r\nocedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are la=\r\nrge deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik proc=\r\nedures. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda the=\r\nre is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucke=\r\nd under the bottom of the prceeding ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. The direction for sprin=\r\nkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:-=\r\n #4 is shown to be\n from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because ap=\r\nasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and e=\r\nnding at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8 Patraasadanam or keeping =\r\nthe vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9=\r\n.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is mi=\r\nssing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam an=\r\nd aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;12. Bra=\r\nhma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;13. Ajya samska=\r\nram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used=\r\n for havan is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladle=\r\ns used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou=\r\n) .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;16.=\r\n Idhma\n pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis m=\r\nissing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the la=\r\ndle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantit=\r\ny of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and many more ............&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;18. Strictly speaking, in the vedi=\r\nc procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the ku=\r\nnda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on =\r\nthe name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to t=\r\nhe particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or =\r\nnot necessary)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked in=\r\nto the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the=\r\n agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the speci=\r\nfied agni devata aikya ahutis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;19. Very good alternate homa\n procedu=\r\nres are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example)=\r\n ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have=\r\n to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures ar=\r\ne designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be =\r\neasily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;20. Homam should not=\r\n be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a vide=\r\no. It involves learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, preci=\r\nsion and perfection.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of k=\r\nnowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let =\r\nalmighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/=\r\nTD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tabl=\r\ne&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-536882524-1277052764=:78249--\r\n\n"}}
