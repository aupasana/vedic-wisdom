There are just 9 planets and=\r\n 12 houses representing millions of things. For example, Ketu shows mistake=\r\ns and the same Ketu shows spiritual progress and even moksha. The 12th hous=\r\ne shows losses and the same 12th house shows moksha. When an astrologer loo=\r\nks at omens or planets influencing various houses, he/she obviously uses hi=\r\ns/her judgment and intuition to connect the dots. His/her subjective opinio=\r\nns will of course come into play.\n=A0\nEven if a really good astrologer come=\r\ns to know of the general area, he/she need not be correct on all specifics.=\r\n Please realize that he/she does not have a TV in which everything is &quot;show=\r\nn&quot;. Excellent astrologers and even excellent priests are not beyond biases =\r\nand their own conditioning.\n=A0\nIf I get a sense that you are making some m=\r\nistake, I may talk about some technicalities like counts, materials etc if =\r\nthat is what I am conditioned to focus on. I may talk about pronunciation i=\r\nf that is what I am conditioned to focus on. I may talk about devotion if t=\r\nhat is what I am conditioned to focus on.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThe tussle between the &quot;letter&quot; & &quot;spirit&quot; of scri=\r\nptures will go on perennially. Those who stick to the &quot;letter&quot; may find irr=\r\neconcilable contradictions between different religions, traditions and scri=\r\nptures and may end up accepting one thing vs the other. Those who understan=\r\nd the &quot;spirit&quot; can often reconcile everything.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nMixing a bit of ghee with every offering (and n=\r\not just sesame seeds) is auspicious. But, if it is cumbersome, there is not=\r\nhing wrong in offering materials individually, as long as SOME ghee is ALSO=\r\n offered in the homam separately. Of course, shastras actually talk about d=\r\noing a homam in complete absence of ghee also.\n=A0\nShastras are very flexib=\r\nle. Shastras say ghee made of cow&#39;s milk is the best. Otherwise, ghee made =\r\nof buffalo&#39;s milk is preferred. If not, ghee made of goat&#39;s milk is preferr=\r\ned. If not, sesame oil is preferred. A long list is given. In the worst cas=\r\ne, even mustard oil (which is not a saattwik substance) is mentioned!\n=A0\nT=\r\nhe bottomline is that making even inferior offerings is better than making =\r\nno offerings.\n=A0\nAs for sesame seeds, they are not &quot;dry&quot; like some other m=\r\naterials (wood, grains etc) and they contain plenty of sesame oil within th=\r\nem. Many scriptures actually praise sesame seeds.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIn any case, my friends, the physical mate=\r\nrials you offer are *external symbols* or proxies and the real offering is =\r\nmade through mind.\n=A0\nSuppose you give an exquisite gift to a friend, but =\r\nwith disinterest and wrong attitude. Your friend may not like it. Suppose y=\r\nou give a humble gift, but with a lot of love and caring. Your friend may a=\r\nppreciate it. Gods will appreciate your love, devotion, sincerity and surre=\r\nnder more than tons of ghee, sesame seeds etc.\n=A0\nAs that surrender is wea=\r\nk within us, we are taking help from external fire and making use of it to =\r\nresonate with inner fire and develop inner surrender. So we need to make re=\r\nasonable external offerings to the external fire to keep it going and keep =\r\nit *saattwik*. So I will not say that you can throw anything. But, as long =\r\nas you offer basically saattwik materials and keep the fire going, you are =\r\nall set. Instead of getting too carried away with rules and technicalities,=\r\n focus on your mental condition and feeling.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOnce I attended a homam conducted by a gentlema=\r\nn who is now the head of a nice temple-cum-ashram. He announced before poor=\r\nnahuti &quot;this poornahuti contains 64 auspicious and rare materials specially=\r\n procured from India. You are so lucky to witness this poornahuti. You may =\r\nnot get such an opportunity again&quot;. THIS attitude of pride or feeling speci=\r\nal is a &quot;dosha&quot; if you ask me. Poornahuti is supposed to be &quot;complete surre=\r\nnder&quot; to deity and not an occasion to feel proud of what materials you are =\r\noffering. If someone else offers just one copra or even a raisin (kismis or=\r\n dried grape) and really feels the sense of surrender to the deity and medi=\r\ntates with focus, it may be a *far superior* poornaahuti.\n=A0\nExternal also=\r\n matters when our minds are so deeply tied to it. But don&#39;t get overly caug=\r\nht in the external. Make the right tradeoffs - do just enough at the extern=\r\nal level and focus most energy on the internal side. That is MY humble advi=\r\nce.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThe 10-to-1 rat=\r\nio rule is not universally followed by all.\n=A0\nIf one has enough time to m=\r\neditate with a mantra for 10 hours for every 1 hour of homam with it, fine,=\r\n go ahead and do it.\n=A0\nIn the old days, people spent hours on spiritual s=\r\nadhana everyday and were quite pure. Times have changed. If one has only 30=\r\n-60 minutes everyday for spiritual sadhana, spending that time in front of =\r\nfire is the optimum way to use it.\n=A0\nIf one wants to paint a perfect pict=\r\nure on a special canvas to submit for an important event, one may want to f=\r\nirst practice on normal paper and paint it on the special canvas after beco=\r\nming proficient. If one does not have that much time, it may be better to j=\r\nust draw an imperfect picture on the special canvas and submit it. Similarl=\r\ny, getting some practice with a mantra before offering it in the all-powerf=\r\nul Fire is a good idea. But, if one has limited time, one has to make wise =\r\ntradeoffs.\n=A0\nOne factor is that Fire amplifies results. If someone who is=\r\n basically quite pure makes offerings in Fire with a mantra that he used in=\r\n past lives, progress may come too quickly and it may be unnerving. With ja=\r\npam, things may happen slower.\n=A0\nBut that is unlikely to happen to most p=\r\neople today anyway. Even if it does, it is debatable whether it is bad or g=\r\nood. My guess is that the 0.0001% to whom such a thing happens will figure =\r\nout how to deal with it.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n=A0\nAs I always say, I am not a missionary. How many people do homam and =\r\nwhat rules they follow, do not concern me. I am just an enabler. I merely m=\r\nake some resources available. People are free to take it or leave it. Also,=\r\n people are free to follow any rules set by their gurus or elders or just t=\r\nheir inner voice. They need not pay heed to my 2 cents.\n=A0\nIn the end, eve=\r\nry soul has its path to traverse.\n=A0\nHappy Vijaya Dasami friends!\n=A0\nBest=\r\n regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org \n--------\n=A0\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;as=\r\nhutosh.srikanth&quot; &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; I =\r\nhave been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.\n&gt; I want t=\r\no point out certain things related to havan so that it can be done as per s=\r\nhastra by others too.\n&gt; I am using a conversation that in fact took place t=\r\no bring out these relevant points.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometime back there was informal &quot;pr=\r\nashNa&quot; session whose summary I am presenting below:\n&gt;\n&gt; [South Indians migh=\r\nt be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when=\r\n something goes wrong - called as dosha.]\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seem=\r\ns to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be perform=\r\ning some kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was =\r\nactually very surprised by this pointed question because I had not told any=\r\nbody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certai=\r\nn errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith m=\r\naterials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Yes I am us=\r\ning Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atl=\r\neast a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Ok. And wh=\r\nat is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you =\r\ndo required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the sam=\r\ne mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: What?... Required =\r\nJapa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set =\r\nof japa?\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shata=\r\nmsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one bec=\r\nomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for=\r\n every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 a=\r\nhuti)\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I r=\r\nead in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with th=\r\nat book series)\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. Puraschar=\r\naNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at leas=\r\nt 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt;\n&gt; The conversation went onto seve=\r\nral other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a acco=\r\nmplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for m=\r\ny ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very h=\r\nappy with my spiritual progress since.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners=\r\n in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all=\r\n requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used =\r\nfor ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\r\n--61789334-1667928566-1351048556=:91730\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Fi=\r\nrst a word on &quot;Prasna&quot;.

My guess is that the 0.0001% to whom such a thi=\r\nng happens will figure out how to deal with it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As I always say, I am not a missionary. How many people do ho=\r\nmam and what rules they follow, do not concern me. I am just an enabler. I =\r\nmerely\n make some resources available. People are free to take it or leave =\r\nit. Also, people are free to follow any rules set by their gurus or elders =\r\nor just their inner voice. They need not pay heed to my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;In the end, every soul has its path to traverse.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Happy Vija=\r\nya Dasami friends!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nstrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;br&gt;-=\r\n-------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikant=\r\nh&quot; &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; My pranams to all.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan so that it can =\r\nbe done as per shastra by others too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; I am using a conversation tha=\r\nt in fact took place to bring out these relevant points.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; So=\r\nmetime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am\n presen=\r\nting below:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;=\r\nashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - call=\r\ned as dosha.]&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha.=\r\n.. Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of=\r\n Agni karya at your home regularly.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actu=\r\nally very surprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody=\r\n about the havan I did at home)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: There ar=\r\ne certain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry =\r\nsamith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conduct=\r\nor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it =\r\nas ahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apa=\r\nrt from that?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do\n required Japa b=\r\nefore giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you =\r\nuse for your regular japa?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? =\r\nIs there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of jap=\r\na?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is=\r\n shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, o=\r\nne becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.=\r\ne. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to gi=\r\nve 1 ahuti)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa =\r\n(based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is alread=\r\ny familiar with that book series)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it =\r\napplies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The r=\r\nule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The conversation went onto several other\n things. Subsequently I=\r\n went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that =\r\nmantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the abov=\r\ne mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress =\r\nsince.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree=\r\n with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybod=\r\ny to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the=\r\n &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ashutosh&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--61789334-1667928566-1351048556=:91730--\r\n\n"}}
