What is known to have transpired between  \n&gt; these two events can be su=\r\nmmed up briefly:\n&gt;\n&gt; At an early age he began working in the service of a k=\r\ning. When the  \n&gt; king died he left this work because of the amorous advanc=\r\nes of the  \n&gt; king&#39;s widow. He then travelled in search of a Guru. At  \n&gt; T=\r\niruchilapalli he met Mouna Guru Arulananda Sivachari. He asked to  \n&gt; be ta=\r\nken as a disciple, but the saint answered &#39;chumma iru&#39;, meaning  \n&gt; &#39;be sti=\r\nll&#39; or &#39;be quiet&#39; or &#39;just be&#39; (a phrase which Ramana  \n&gt; Maharshi also use=\r\nd on a number of occasions). However, the saint  \n&gt; said that when the time=\r\n was ripe he would initiate him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thayumanavar then returned home and ma=\r\nrried. Soon after his wife  \n&gt; delivered their first child, a boy, she died=\r\n. That again prompted  \n&gt; Thayumanavar to leave home in answer to his spiri=\r\ntual calling. He  \n&gt; once more approached Arulananda Sivachari and, true to=\r\n his word, the  \n&gt; guru fulfilled his promise and initiated Thayumanavar in=\r\nto sannyas.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thayumanavar followed the discipline of silence (mouna), wh=\r\nich he  \n&gt; describes as: &quot;that state which spontaneously manifests after th=\r\ne  \n&gt; annihilation of the ego.&quot; He says: &quot;It is a state beyond light and  \n=\r\n&gt; darkness, but it is called light, since language is inadequate to  \n&gt; exp=\r\nress it. The ego disappears and &#39;I&#39; spontaneously manifests in  \n&gt; full glo=\r\nry.&quot; The Maharshi particularly singled out this verse of his  \n&gt; for admira=\r\ntion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thayumanavar was equally great as a saint and a poet. Often he wo=\r\nuld  \n&gt; retire to the forest or public gardens and remained for days  \n&gt; ab=\r\nsorbed in the bliss of the Self. Legend has it that he was sitting  \n&gt; thus=\r\n, immobile in samadhi in a public garden in Ramnad when the  \n&gt; gardeners, =\r\nnot noticing him, piled a heap of dry leaves and twigs  \n&gt; about him and se=\r\nt fire to it, and thus his body was consumed and he  \n&gt; merged in the Supre=\r\nme.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thayumanavar&#39;s key teaching is to discipline the mind, control  \n&gt; =\r\ndesires and meditate peacefully. He went on to say that &quot;it is easy  \n&gt; to =\r\ncontrol an elephant, catch hold of the tiger&#39;s tail, grab the  \n&gt; snake and=\r\n dance, dictate the angels, transmigrate into another body,  \n&gt; walk on wat=\r\ner or sit on the sea; but it is more difficult to control  \n&gt; the mind and =\r\nremain quiet&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramana Maharshi was often heard quoting from his exquisi=\r\nte verses.  \n&gt; The following are ten verses especially selected by the Maha=\r\nrshi:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 & 2. The individual ego known as &quot;I&quot; having manifested and  \n&gt; =\r\ntroubled everyone, the universal Maya, the diversifying agency,  \n&gt; spontan=\r\neously follows in its wake. Who can possibly describe the  \n&gt; vast ocean of=\r\n misery consequent upon it? It appears as the flesh,  \n&gt; the body, the sens=\r\nes, interior and exterior, as the all pervading  \n&gt; ether, air, fire, water=\r\n and earth, as mountain, forest, huge visions  \n&gt; like hills physical and s=\r\nubtle, as forgetfulness and memory, and so  \n&gt; on, rising up wave after wav=\r\ne and beating against man, bringing  \n&gt; pleasure and pain, which are the re=\r\nsult of his past actions, and  \n&gt; also their remedies known as creeds, reli=\r\ngions, God-Seeker, and the  \n&gt; testimonies and sanctions found in various s=\r\nciences, and explained  \n&gt; by logic. All these are more numerous than even =\r\nthe fine grains of  \n&gt; sand on the seashore.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Unaccountable troubles =\r\ncrop up spontaneously, sheaf upon sheaf.  \n&gt; How to root them out wholesale=\r\n, even as burning up a hill of camphor  \n&gt; without residue in a vast blaze =\r\nof fire? In order to achieve this  \n&gt; miracle, and to enlighten me, Grace t=\r\nook shape. In every respect,  \n&gt; like my self, eating and sleeping, sufferi=\r\nng and enjoying, bearing a  \n&gt; name and born somewhere, it appeared as the =\r\nSilent Guru, like a deer  \n&gt; used to decoy another of its species.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. A=\r\nnd claimed my body, possessions and life itself and consistently  \n&gt; with t=\r\nhe process of elimination, signified &quot;you are not the five  \n&gt; senses nor t=\r\nhe five elements, nor the limbs, nor the mind, nor their  \n&gt; attributes, no=\r\nr all these collectively, nor the body nor knowledge  \n&gt; nor ignorance. You=\r\n are pure consciousness, unassociated like a  \n&gt; crystal, but reflecting th=\r\ne background to lookers-on; whereas we  \n&gt; (guru) are only the inherent nat=\r\nure revealing the truth on finding  \n&gt; you ripe for it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. &quot;If eager t=\r\no reach Consciousness-Bliss-Eternity innermost in all,  \n&gt; which is also th=\r\ne inner abode of refreshing Grace, listen to the  \n&gt; course I indicate. May=\r\n you reach the Pure Heart and abide there  \n&gt; forever! May dense ignorance =\r\nvanish for you! May you attain to Bliss- \n&gt; Consciousness! May bondage ceas=\r\ne for you!&quot; Communicating thus,\n&gt;\n&gt; 6. &quot;And dispensing the true knowledge o=\r\nf the Natural and Unique  \n&gt; Silence which destroys all bondage and where t=\r\nhere is no meditation  \n&gt; nor the ego, no space, no time, no direction, no =\r\nassociation, no  \n&gt; elimination, no differentiation, no expression, no phen=\r\nomena of  \n&gt; night and day, no end, no beginning, no middle, no interior or=\r\n  \n&gt; exterior, nor an aggregate of all these.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; 7. (The Guru indicated f=\r\nurther) that, though all these are  \n&gt; eliminated, &quot;It&quot; is not void, but is=\r\n Natural, Eternal Be-ing  \n&gt; inexpressible by words, not manifesting as ego=\r\n, but is the Reality  \n&gt; engulfing all, having swallowed all ignorance like=\r\n day covering  \n&gt; night, and absorbing unhindered all knowledge, metamorpho=\r\nsing the  \n&gt; person into Itself, It shines in Silence, Self-effulgent;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n8. With its emergence, It prevents any other from appearing; and all  \n&gt; el=\r\nse is put out suddenly like burning camphor blown away without  \n&gt; residual=\r\n flicker or glow; and in its place It shines beyond the  \n&gt; senses, and apa=\r\nrt from the knower, known and knowledge; and yet It  \n&gt; is there, though wh=\r\no can speak of it and to whom? For if It arises,  \n&gt; the individual is meta=\r\nmorphosed; It will assert Itself (Literally:  \n&gt; It Speaks Itself),\n&gt;\n&gt; 9. =\r\n(And further on), if it is said to be &quot;It,&quot; the question arises  \n&gt; &quot;which,=\r\n&quot; though such doubt about the non-dual One is illogical; so  \n&gt; transcendin=\r\ng it also, King Janaka or Suka and others remained like  \n&gt; the bee intoxic=\r\nated with honey in that state. (The same Guru&#39;s)  \n&gt; blessing helped me to =\r\nreach it. Grace is needed in order to reach  \n&gt; the Nirvikalpa Samadhi and =\r\nattain absolute Bliss. I will not rest  \n&gt; nor attend to my wants until I a=\r\nttain it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 10. On the &quot;I&quot; idea of the individual ego vanishing, there sp=\r\nrings  \n&gt; up within me a current of &quot;I-I&quot; endless indeed. This confers blis=\r\ns  \n&gt; engulfing all my knowledge, unique and transcendental, ending in  \n&gt; =\r\nSilence!

On the &quot;I&quot; idea of the individual ego vanishing, there springs up wit=\r\nhin me a current of &quot;I-I&quot; endless indeed. This confers bliss engulfing all =\r\nmy knowledge, unique and transcendental, ending in Silence! How then can Si=\r\nlence be expressed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sourc=\r\nes&lt;/span&gt;:&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/199=\r\n5/?pg=3Djul-aug&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunacha&quot;&gt;http://w=\r\nww.arunacha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;la.org/newslette&lt;wbr&gt;rs/1995/?&lt;wbr&gt;pg=3Djul-aug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n2) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thayumanavar&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;.org/wiki/&lt;wbr&gt;=\r\nThayumanavar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 &nbsp;=E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B &nbsp;=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 &nbs=\r\np;=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 &nbsp;=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D &nbsp;=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end g=\r\nroup email --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;=3D\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-1--262248763--\r\n\n"}}
