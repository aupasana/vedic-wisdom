In the Initial part of Ganapathy Homam Manuals, The direction of =\r\nmovement of ladle with ghee while pouring & saying &#39;Swaha&#39; is mentioned, bu=\r\nt rest of the places there is no direction mentioned.\n     Is there any gen=\r\neric rule when there is no directions mentioned?\n   2. On the &#39;Kalash Suddh=\r\ni&#39; when you keep in for a week, before changing the water, do we need to do=\r\n the &#39;Kalash Suddhi&#39; procedure everytime to the same water?\n     Also in so=\r\nme other homams i had happen to see there is a kalash with saffron,clove et=\r\nc installed and a coconut kept above the same. But the water is never taken=\r\n in this case!!\n    Any idea on the difference?\n   3. In the &#39;pranayamam&#39; t=\r\nowards the end, I am assuming that there is no need to keep\n      &#39;akshata&#39;=\r\n in the left hand as in the first time. Is this right? \n   4. Are there any=\r\n days during which you should not do Homam? eg  Passing away of  relations =\r\netc, especially when you only have heard of them and not known them.\n\nThank=\r\ns & Regards,\nShashi\n\n\n\n\n"}}
