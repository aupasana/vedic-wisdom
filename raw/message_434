But they have \nput wool into their ears for such phenom=\r\nena since &quot;Vedic \nastrologers&quot; want them to celebrate Uttarayana on January=\r\n 15 and \nDakshinayana on July 15 and so on!\n\nIn short, most of the Hindu so=\r\nciety appears to have become clones of \nMaya the mlechha just because of th=\r\neir fatal infatuation with &quot;Vedic \nastrology&quot;!
