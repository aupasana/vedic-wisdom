It contains the =\r\nessence of great scriptures such as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; and &quot;BhagavadGita&quot; ,=\r\n sooktas such as Purusha Sooktam and Narayana Sooktam and hymns such as Gan=\r\napathi Atharva Seersham. It is a very important hymn.\n\nSavita is the highes=\r\nt form of Surya. He is basically the supreme cosmic being. He is Atman, the=\r\n pure spirit that fills the entire universe - the creation as well as the u=\r\nncreated. He is the pure light behind all the light and darkness that we se=\r\ne. Good and bad, gods and demons, pleasure and pain, all such dualities are=\r\n but different manifestations of the same Brahman. The ONE Brahman manifest=\r\ns as the duality and diverse beings.\n\nThe one Atman, which is but pure ligh=\r\nt, manifests as duality - as light and darkness - and fills the entire univ=\r\nerse. Savita dwells in Brahman as well as the entire perishable creation. E=\r\nverything that has manifested has to perish. Savita dwells in all - in the =\r\nimperishable Brahman as well as the perishable manifestations of Brahman (v=\r\narious worlds, gods, demons and other beings).\n\nThe ONE pure light of Savit=\r\na manifests as DIVERSE objects ranging all the way from pure light to darkn=\r\ness and fills all beings. With the pure and untaintable essence of Brahman =\r\nand the movement caused in Brahman due to desire, Savita enters all the bei=\r\nngs including gods. In other words, all the beings are created from Brahman=\r\n and the desire/movement in Brahman.\n\nVedanta teaches that Brahman is unman=\r\nifested pure consciousness. A part of Brahman causes movement in Brahman, w=\r\nhich becomes a desire and gets fulfilled immediately. This results in the c=\r\nreation of various beings. The word &quot;ratha&quot; refers to this. The pure essenc=\r\ne of Brahman (hiraNyaya) as well as the desire that caused a movement of th=\r\nought in Brahman (ratha) enter all beings. Savita enters all being as Shiva=\r\n as well as Shakti!\n\nWhen all the desires come to a halt and the movement o=\r\nf mind stops, all beings can experience the pure essence of Brahman that ha=\r\ns entered them (i.e. sat-chid-ananda) . When the desire is there, there are=\r\n thoughts and movement of mind and the beings do not experience the pure es=\r\nsence of Brahman that has entered them.\n\nThe hymn says that the pure essenc=\r\ne of Brahman (Shiva) and the desire that causes movement of thought (Shakti=\r\n) are both aspects of ONE Savita only.\n\nSavita enters all the beings with t=\r\nhe pure essence and the desire/thought and experiences the worlds and being=\r\ns through them. If a person called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; exists, it is actually S=\r\navita who exists through him. If a person called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; experience=\r\ns the entire world - various worlds and beings in those worlds - it is actu=\r\nally Savita who has entered him that experiences the entire world through h=\r\nim!! All his thoughts, experiences and actions are actually those of Savita=\r\n - the in-dwelling spirit.\n\nThis is the same as what Ganapathi Atharva Seer=\r\nsham means by &quot;tvameva kevalam kartAsi...&quot;. This is the same as what Krishn=\r\na means when he tells Arjuna in BhagavadGita that it is Krishna who acts th=\r\nrough various beings and that the beings should not be deluded to think tha=\r\nt they are doing things.\n\nSavita in this hymn is represented as the same su=\r\npreme cosmic being that is referred in various other Vedic scriptures!\n\nMos=\r\nt authorities have interpreted the second line to mean that Sun goes on a c=\r\nhariot and watches the entire world. That is a gross interpretation and mis=\r\nses the subtle and deeper meaning.\n\nIn fact, when Atman goes on the chariot=\r\n (ratha) of desire (ratha), it moves and sees the diverse creation. When th=\r\ne chariot (ratha) stops, then the desire (ratha) stops and there is no move=\r\nment of thought. No longer a diverse creation is perceived and there is onl=\r\ny bliss of true being (sat-chid-ananda) . Thus, even the gross chaiot inter=\r\npretation is a metaphor for the subtle interpretation given above!\n\nThis hy=\r\nmn is very important as it covers several important Vedantic concepts:\n\n(1)=\r\n The supreme cosmic being is one, but assumes duality.\n(2) The supreme cosm=\r\nic being enters all the beings with the duality.\n(3) The supreme cosmic bei=\r\nng experiences through all the beings.\n(4) The pure essence of supreme cosm=\r\nic being enters all the beings and helps them experience sat-chid-ananda.\n(=\r\n5) The desire (movement of thought) in the supreme cosmic being enters all =\r\nthe beings and results in movement of thought within them and diverse world=\r\n experiences.=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.com=\r\ncast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!

When the chariot (ratha) stops, then the desire (ratha) st=\r\nops and there is no movement of thought. No longer a diverse creation is pe=\r\nrceived and there is only bliss of true being (sat-chid-ananda) . Thus, eve=\r\nn the gross chaiot interpretation is a metaphor for the subtle interpretati=\r\non given above!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This hymn is very important as it covers several imp=\r\nortant Vedantic concepts:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) The supreme cosmic being is one, but a=\r\nssumes duality.&lt;BR&gt;(2) The supreme cosmic being enters all the beings with =\r\nthe duality.&lt;BR&gt;(3) The supreme cosmic being experiences through all the be=\r\nings.&lt;BR&gt;(4) The pure essence of supreme cosmic being enters all the beings=\r\n and helps them experience sat-chid-ananda.&lt;BR&gt;(5) The desire (movement of =\r\nthought) in the supreme cosmic being enters all the beings and results in m=\r\novement of thought within them and diverse world\n experiences.&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Spirituality: &lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Free Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comca=\r\nst. net&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial\n size=3D2&gt;Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n      &lt;!--9--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Bring your gang together.
