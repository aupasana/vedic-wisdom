When they visited Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa, he recognized the \n&gt; spiritual potential of the boy and a=\r\nsked the rich man to leave the boy \n&gt; with him for he needed someone to ser=\r\nve him. He then moulded the young \n&gt; boy into a spiritual giant.\n&gt; \n&gt; He wa=\r\ns originally uncultured and a bit impetuous with people that \n&gt; mis-treated=\r\n Ramakrishna in any way. With training and practice, he \n&gt; became a spiritu=\r\nal giant. There were times when he would profusely sweat \n&gt; while in deep m=\r\neditation inside the temple in sweltering heat and \n&gt; Ramakrishna would sit=\r\n in front of him and fan him to reduce the \n&gt; sweating! There was a time wh=\r\nen he was meditating on a rock in the \n&gt; middle of water and fell inside wa=\r\nter when a big wave hit. He was so \n&gt; deeply in meditation that he did not =\r\nget up and remained still through \n&gt; all of this! Other disciples of Ramakr=\r\nishna rushed there and pulled him \n&gt; out. Ramakrishna used to praise his re=\r\nmarkable ability to lose himself \n&gt; in deep meditation!\n&gt; \n&gt; Though he was =\r\nilliterate and unable to write his own name, he understood \n&gt; the essence o=\r\nf Upanishads and spoke great spiritual truths that came \n&gt; through direct e=\r\nxperience and deep realization. He is the sishya who \n&gt; spent the most time=\r\n listening to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and observing \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vive=\r\nkananda said he was the biggest adbhuta (wonder/miracle) done \n&gt; by Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One who thinks that one is =\r\nlearned or smart or pious and and has even a \n&gt; little bit of pride left wi=\r\nll not make much progress. One who does not \n&gt; have any pride, completely s=\r\nurrenders and depends fully on god, will \n&gt; make faster progress.
