But anyways, leave\n\nthis fucking business aside for a mo=\r\nment. Lets go back to the\n\ndiscussion, the end of which will be very fun.\n\n=\r\n\n\nStudent: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Don&#39;t =\r\ntwist my words, I said right now you are akin to a teddy\n\nbear. You have be=\r\nen that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who\n\nclaps, basically all=\r\n the battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical\n\nterms they are called =\r\n&quot;births&quot;.\n\n\n\nStudent : How may I ask?\n\n\n\nTeacher : What is your name?\n\n\n\nSt=\r\nudent : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humorous\n\nreas=\r\nons)\n\n\n\nTeacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma\n\nas the bear =\r\n(the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,\n\nthat &quot;I am Chaman=\r\n Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old\n\n, i like this girl,=\r\n I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I\n\nhate that, I this, and=\r\n I that&quot;, okay?\n\n\n\nStudent : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about himse=\r\nlf*\n\n\n\nTeacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner than\n=\r\n\nlater, do you know what happens or what that means?\n\n\n\nStudent : I die, bu=\r\nt in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t die.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Very good, you have read that off =\r\nof a book, ever realized it?\n\nAre you not afraid of death?\n\n\n\nStudent : No,=\r\n I am not afraid of death.\n\n\n\nThe lights turn off in the room, there is tot=\r\nal darkness, for 5 minutes\n\nthere is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, a=\r\nnd then a pair of deep\n\nred eyes appear in the dark, and in the most ghastl=\r\ny voice ever asks Mr\n\nChaman, &quot;why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear=\r\n is death, and only\n\nthe lights have gone out, I haven&#39;t even started with =\r\nyou yet, if you\n\nsay you are not going to die, then why so scared?&quot;\n\n\n\nSudd=\r\nenly the lights turn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off,\n\nwith Ch=\r\naman shivering.\n\n\n\nTeacher : You said you were not afraid.\n\n\n\nStudent : I n=\r\never meant it, like that.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Then in what way did you mean it? Ta=\r\nke it as a lesson that\n\npractical stuff in this spirituality business is fa=\r\nr greater than all\n\nyour books combined. You get lost while reading, you th=\r\nink you are\n\ndifferent. To me you are no worse than the thousand others I m=\r\neet,\n\nin-fact they are better off without the texts you have studied.\n\n\n\nSt=\r\nudent : Agreed, but don&#39;t scare me like that. Again.\n\n\n\nTeacher : I will, i=\r\nf you make such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,\n\nwhere were we? The death=\r\n of the teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy\n\nremains, the outer shell r=\r\nemains, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is\n\neither buried or burnt, in e=\r\nssence done away with, because it is of no\n\nuse. Right?\n\n\n\nStudent : Right\n=\r\n\n\n\nTeacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, when you\n\nremo=\r\nve the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally\n\nuseless, i=\r\nt can&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t do shit.\n\nThus, at dea=\r\nth, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s body. You\n\nnever die, you a=\r\nre only the battery powering this personality which\n\nleads to powering your=\r\n body.\n\n\n\nStudent: How can you even=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6\n\n\n\nTeacher : Lets con=\r\nsider that you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.\n\nWhen you plug the bat=\r\nteries into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,\n\nwithout the battery the=\r\n car is idle, but as soon as I put the battery\n\nin, the car goes=E2=80=A6=\r\n=E2=80=A6.. beep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.\n\n\n\nStudent : sits in sil=\r\nence knowing well that interrupting now will be the\n\nbiggest mistake ever.\n=\r\n\n\n\nTeacher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into=\r\n\n\nlets say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,\n=\r\n\nor acts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?\n\n\n\nStudent : Teddy is idle=\r\n, literally useless.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same batte=\r\nry that powered the\n\ncar, it was the same battery that powered the teddy be=\r\nar, and it is the\n\nsame battery that can power any toy, correct?\n\n\n\nStudent=\r\n : Correct\n\n\n\nTeacher : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself=\r\n to be the\n\ncar. It believes &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 =\r\nmm\n\ntorque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in m=\r\ny\n\npassengers seat, I am the king baby, look at how hot I am&quot;\n\n\n\nStudent: O=\r\nh dear god=E2=80=A6.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Then I take out the battery from the car.=\r\n And PHAT it is a\n\nuseless piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a te=\r\nddy, suddenly it\n\nbelieves itself to be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, =\r\nI am the teddy,\n\nI am mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddl=\r\ny I am, I can\n\neven clap my hands &quot;, and when I take the battery out, PHAT,=\r\n the teddy\n\nis=E2=80=A6..\n\n\n\nStudent : Useless, and dead.\n\n\n\nTeacher : That=\r\ns a useless conclusion, it is known by the world, not\n\nrealized. Every tom =\r\ndick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point\n\nis the battery confus=\r\nes itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.\n\n\n\nStudent : So the battery =\r\nis the soul?\n\n\n\nTeacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* Who said that?\n\n\n\n=\r\nStudent : You did.\n\n\n\nTeacher : *another phatek on the head of the student*=\r\n When did I say?\n\nYou read it in one of your fancy articles and commentarie=\r\ns and satsangs\n\nthat people do, genius, and you read it all too wrong, you =\r\nread it and\n\nthus think you &#39;know&#39;, you never practiced, fools you people a=\r\nre. Most\n\nof the time you people are fed bullshit and you gobble it up like=\r\n pigs\n\nin mud. That reminds me we haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  pizza in a long\n=\r\n\ntime, lets order one. LOL\n\n\n\nStudent : Sorry=E2=80=A6\n\n\n\nTeacher : Don&#39;t b=\r\ne, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our\n\ndiscussion on toys.=\r\n The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you\n\nconfuse yourself to be=\r\n Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been\n\nplugged into a a toy (re=\r\nad body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on\n\nthe &quot;confusion&quot; aspect.\n\n\n\nS=\r\ntudent : Then who am I?\n\n\n\nTeacher : You are the ever lasting consciousness=\r\n, the universal bliss,\n\nthe infinite, the ever pervading light of the unive=\r\nrse!!! Breathe in and\n\nout and feel the bliss!!\n\n\n\nStudent : Yess!!! this i=\r\ns what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*\n\n*Smells huge amounts of odor*=\r\n=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?\n\n\n\nTeacher : I just farted, feels so=\r\n blissful, did you feel your bliss too?\n\n\n\nStudent : Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.\n\n\n\nTe=\r\nacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent lives\n\nin =\r\nsearch of who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and out,\n\nand =\r\nthinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???\n\nBefkuf!! C=\r\nhaman kahin ka!!\n\n\n\nStudent : But you only said that  &quot;You are the ever las=\r\nting\n\nconsciousness, the universal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading\n=\r\n\nlight of the universe!!! Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!&quot;\n\n\n\nTeach=\r\ner : It is called a test, and needless to say you have scored a\n\ncompartmen=\r\nt.\n\n\n\nStudent : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.\n\n\n\nTeacher : So back to=\r\n who you are, you are just like the battery who is\n\nthe source of that body=\r\n and the personality and confuses itself to be &quot;\n\nI am Chaman Sharma, age 2=\r\n0, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,\n\nam a male, love to party, =\r\nown a mercedez, worship a a little, interested\n\nin god and whatever &quot;\n\n\n\nSt=\r\nudent : So who am I?\n\n\n\nTeacher : You are duracell=E2=80=A6..How do they wr=\r\nite post a mathematics\n\nsolution=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence p=\r\nroved.

That is what is meant by Sadhana to most\n\npeople. But does an=\r\nyone know what is Sadhana?\n\n\n\nStudent : You shed some light on it?\n\n\n\nTeach=\r\ner: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is\n\nbasically =\r\nin essence, and mark these all important words.\n\n&quot; YOU trying to convince y=\r\nourself that &quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n\n\n\nBirths are spent on this my boy, births=\r\n not lives, it takes a lot of\n\neffort to tell and convince yourself that yo=\r\nu are just not you.\n\n\n\nStudent : and how do you do that?\n\n\n\nTeacher : By sa=\r\ndhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You\n\neventually yourself beco=\r\nme the form of the mantra that you chant, thus\n\nrealizing the deity( the bi=\r\ng daddy battery)/ the specific form of the\n\none (the source of all the Big =\r\nand small batteries). A mantra means man\n\nki tarana, does it not?\n\n\n\nStuden=\r\nt : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not\n\nthis pers=\r\nonality?\n\n\n\nTeacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, t=\r\no\n\nyourself.\n\n\n\nStudent: I am beginning to understand a little, can you exp=\r\nlain where\n\ndoes a deity stand in this whole battery concept?\n\n\n\nTeacher : =\r\nIf you are the battery, the battery has to have a source, you\n\nare not svay=\r\nambhu that you exist on you own. The deity is like a huge\n\npower station in=\r\n your comparison. It is almost infinite, but since it is\n\na power station i=\r\nt is bound to have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa\n\nsized battery it i=\r\ns endless. Chaman&#39;s source is his parents, but\n\nchaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (b=\r\nattery) parent is the power station.\n\n\n\nStudent : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that&#39;s wh=\r\ny she is worshipped as ma?\n\n\n\nTeacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a g=\r\nirl who has realized that\n\nhe/she himself is the battery and then went on t=\r\no become one with a\n\npower station and thus sees himself/herself in everyth=\r\ning because the\n\npower station is the source of everything , of all batteri=\r\nes. And since\n\nhe/she actually knows that all elements too are currents and=\r\n everything\n\nelse too, he/she actually sees it as that. And thus, the &quot;mira=\r\ncles&quot;. Let\n\nsay I fully well don&#39;t see a difference between me and this tab=\r\nle, thus\n\nI am this table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I can do it, beca=\r\nuse I\n\nam actually it. To you it is a table, to me it is just a current, wh=\r\no is\n\njust &quot;me&quot;.\n\n\n\nStudent: Oooohhhhhhhh=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.\n\n\n\nTeacher : H=\r\ne maybe sai baba to you, but thats how your eyes perceive him\n\nto be as, an=\r\n old man with frail clothing, belongs to shirdi etc etc, but\n\ninside he is =\r\nfar beyond what you or I can comprehend. He first realized\n\nhe was a batter=\r\ny by doing penance, thus killing himself in the process,\n\nthe he realized t=\r\nhat the battery is as good as the power station because\n\nthe current is the=\r\n same, so he became one with that, and then he went\n\nbeyond and came back t=\r\no guide as he was chosen, just like many others\n\nare, like my great teacher=\r\n, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna and all\n\nothers=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6\n\n\n=\r\n\nStudent : And the source of the power station is?\n\n\n\nTeacher : The one- Sa=\r\ntya shri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put into words\n\nbecause he is infinite =\r\nand the words are finite. It is purely on\n\ndefining him religious wars, rio=\r\nts between religions , and intellectual\n\ndiscussions and debates on this th=\r\ning called internet happen, but\n\nhe/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Man=\r\ny people focus on that , and\n\nget lost, but focus on the power station (dei=\r\nty) and it will take you to\n\nbig daddy.\n\nImagine an endless field of curren=\r\nt in comparison of the power station ,\n\nan endless current which exists and=\r\n all others are a figment of it. The\n\npower stations are a part of it, the =\r\ncurrent has taken the form of one\n\nconcentrated zone.. But even this contai=\r\nns error of speech, so chuck it.\n\nThe ultimate is only realized when you ar=\r\ne one with the power station so\n\nlets focus there.\n\n\n\nStudent : So the one =\r\nhas taken forms of different power stations to help\n\nthe batteries who are =\r\nspread out to help unite back with it?\n\n\n\nTeacher : Brilliant.\n\n\n\nStudent: =\r\nSo all our lives we debate/fight and cut each other off to\n\nclaim which pow=\r\ner station (deity) is more powerful over the other and\n\nsuperior to all oth=\r\ners, when in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to\n\nbe different, when t=\r\nhey are in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and\n\nlaughing back at us?\n\n\n\nTeach=\r\ner : ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.\n\n\n\nStudent : And we try to worship 10 diffe=\r\nrent ones and always think that\n\nwe should worship as many to get maximum b=\r\nenefit for our mistakingly\n\nconfused identities of teddy , the car and all =\r\nother toys?\n\n\n\nTeacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I am listening.\n\n\n\nStuden=\r\nt: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debates and\n\npseudo breat=\r\nhing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock feathers\n\nand punches t=\r\no the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts which\n\nthey don&#39;t know =\r\na thing about?\n\n\n\nTeacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically you,=\r\n she is the\n\nbattery. the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of &quot;=\r\nmy\n\nkundalini&quot;, err=E2=80=A6. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyw=\r\nays ,\n\nmany make this error, but it is essential because other wise you can=\r\n&#39;t\n\nexplain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,=\r\n\n\n&quot;you&quot; will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets\n=\r\n\nsay a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full\n\nglory=\r\n . Whatever you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the\n\nlimitatio=\r\nns of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.\n\n\n\nStudent: So then how do realized souls stay =\r\nin their bodies post their\n\nrealization?\n\n\n\nTeacher: Intentional identifica=\r\ntion with the personality by permission\n\nfrom the power station to fulfill =\r\nsome higher purpose of the power\n\nstation to guide more batteries to realiz=\r\ne that they are not toys. But\n\nthey can leave in an instant, because they k=\r\nnow realities that are much\n\nhigher than our world.\n\n\n\nStudent : So what is=\r\n moksha?\n\n\n\nTeacher : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven=\r\n&#39;t merged\n\nback with a power station yourself first. You tell me when you h=\r\nave\n\nmerged back, how do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You=\r\n\n\nyourself have become one with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even\n\nt=\r\nhe battery has dissolved, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remember\n\nit=\r\n, because you are not there.\n\n\n\nStudent : I can&#39;t explain it.\n\n\n\nTeacher : =\r\nWe can&#39;t, It is like explaining the color red to a blind man.\n\nYou will say=\r\n mars  is red or the red light is red, he will say I have\n\nbeen blind from =\r\nbirth I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. You will\n\nsay tomato, he wil=\r\nl say fuck off.\n\n\n\nStudent : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained.\n\n\n\nTeacher : it=\r\n can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted\n\ntopic. To add =\r\nto ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy\n\nis a helicopter,=\r\n one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but\n\nthe car is very di=\r\nfferent form the toy, thus if you explain a high level\n\nconcept to both, bo=\r\nth will understand differently and have a go at it\n\nwith debates and what n=\r\not, which leads to more confusion. Better is both\n\nrealize it themselves. S=\r\no you focus on realizing that you are duracell\n\nfirst, mr chaman, everythin=\r\ng else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.\n\nNow time for my reward for my =\r\nwinning the bet. Dance naked on the road.\n\n\n\nStudent : What?\n\n\n\nTeacher : Y=\r\nou thought 4 times.\n\n\n\nStudent: But I will be disgraced.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Nope,=\r\n Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will laugh at\n\nChaman, who is your =\r\n67432nd incarnation, you have done this thousand\n\ntimes before, so what??\n\n=\r\n\n\nStudent : I hate you.\n\n\n\nTeacher : I love you too.\n\n\n\nStudent : You are s=\r\nerious on this?\n\n\n\nTeacher : Very\n\n\n\nStudent: : This is why some of the hig=\r\nher ones don&#39;t give a shit about\n\nroaming naked and doing wild stuff, just =\r\nto keep people away from them.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Yes, but a lot of frauds copy a=\r\nnd disgrace the higher ones.\n\n\n\nStudent : Fine, I will do it. But you will =\r\nhandle my parent&#39;s reaction.\n\n\n\nTeacher : Done.\n\n\n\nAfter the student did th=\r\ne act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next\n\nday, yet every one saw it =\r\nthat day, and seemed to make faces at the\n\nstudent for an hour or so. How e=\r\nverybody forgot is a different story\n\naltogether.\n\n\n\nDo sadhana, before you=\r\nr battery is pulled out, replugged into another\n\ntoy and yet again, your co=\r\nnfusion will prevail driving you to do things\n\nthat will push you further a=\r\nnd further down.\n\n\n\nJai Shree Radheya!!\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--31392086-111639513-1345171482=:85245\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Very nice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subhamasthu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KK&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Thu, 8/16/12, scsa_taker3 &lt;i&gt;&lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt=\r\n;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16,=\r\n 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: scsa_taker3 &lt;scsa=\r\n_taker3@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] You are Duracell&lt;br&gt;To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Thursday, August 16, 2012, 1:52 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1970382259&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:non=\r\ne;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1970382259ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n=\r\n      &lt;p&gt;A short conversation between a student and teacher.&lt;br&gt;\nChant as y=\r\nou read along.

Especially the one&lt;br&gt;\nwhich is modeled i=\r\nn the form of a bear, and claps its hands as soon as&lt;br&gt;\nit is powered on. =\r\nIts hands hold two plates which strike each other ,&lt;br&gt;\nthe bear&#39;s eyes lig=\r\nht up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we&lt;br&gt;\nare ready to go.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other types also, =\r\nlike&lt;br&gt;\nwhen you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts operatin=\r\ng, and&lt;br&gt;\ngoing bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating som=\r\ne cuddly&lt;br&gt;\nlines.

But anyways, leave=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nthis fucking business aside for a moment. Lets go back to the&lt;br&gt;\ndisc=\r\nussion, the end of which will be very fun.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: we were on the=\r\n topic that I am a teddy bear.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Don&#39;t twist my words, I s=\r\naid right now you are akin to a teddy&lt;br&gt;\nbear. You have been that car, the=\r\n helicopter , the teddy, the bear who&lt;br&gt;\nclaps, basically all the battery =\r\npowered toys earlier. In philosophical&lt;br&gt;\nterms they are called &quot;births&quot;.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : How may I ask?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : What is your name?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security &amp; other hu=\r\nmorous&lt;br&gt;\nreasons)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman=\r\n sharma&lt;br&gt;\nas the bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and c=\r\nlaps,&lt;br&gt;\nthat &quot;I am Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 yea=\r\nrs old&lt;br&gt;\n, i like this girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read t=\r\nhis, I&lt;br&gt;\nhate that, I this, and I that&quot;, okay?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Go on..=\r\n * feeling a bit ridiculous about himself*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : So when Chama=\r\nn dies, which is going to happen sooner than&lt;br&gt;\nlater, do you know what ha=\r\nppens or what that means?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;=\r\nt die.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever=\r\n realized it?&lt;br&gt;\nAre you not afraid of death?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : No, I am =\r\nnot afraid of death.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe lights turn off in the room, there is tot=\r\nal darkness, for 5 minutes&lt;br&gt;\nthere is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified=\r\n, and then a pair of deep&lt;br&gt;\nred eyes appear in the dark, and in the most =\r\nghastly voice ever asks Mr&lt;br&gt;\nChaman, &quot;why are you so afraid? the basis of=\r\n all fear is death, and only&lt;br&gt;\nthe lights have gone out, I haven&#39;t even s=\r\ntarted with you yet, if you&lt;br&gt;\nsay you are not going to die, then why so s=\r\ncared?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSuddenly the lights turn back on, the teacher is laughing =\r\nhis ass off,&lt;br&gt;\nwith Chaman shivering.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You said you wer=\r\ne not afraid.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : I never meant it, like that.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeac=\r\nher : Then in what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that&lt;br&gt;\npracti=\r\ncal stuff in this spirituality business is far greater than all&lt;br&gt;\nyour bo=\r\noks combined. You get lost while reading, you think you are&lt;br&gt;\ndifferent. =\r\nTo me you are no worse than the thousand others I meet,&lt;br&gt;\nin-fact they ar=\r\ne better off without the texts you have studied.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Agreed,=\r\n but don&#39;t scare me like that. Again.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : I will, if you mak=\r\ne such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,&lt;br&gt;\nwhere were we? The death of th=\r\ne teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy&lt;br&gt;\nremains, the outer shell rema=\r\nins, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is&lt;br&gt;\neither buried or burnt, in e=\r\nssence done away with, because it is of no&lt;br&gt;\nuse. Right?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent=\r\n : Right&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this,=\r\n when you&lt;br&gt;\nremove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is lit=\r\nerally&lt;br&gt;\nuseless, it can&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t d=\r\no shit.&lt;br&gt;\nThus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s bod=\r\ny. You&lt;br&gt;\nnever die, you are only the battery powering this personality wh=\r\nich&lt;br&gt;\nleads to powering your body.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: How can you even=E2=\r\n=80=A6=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Lets consider that you are two batteries=\r\n, two aa sized ones.&lt;br&gt;\nWhen you plug the batteries into a car, suddenly t=\r\nhe car comes to life,&lt;br&gt;\nwithout the battery the car is idle, but as soon =\r\nas I put the battery&lt;br&gt;\nin, the car goes=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.. beep beep hon=\r\nk honk, move, I am a car.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : sits in silence knowing well t=\r\nhat interrupting now will be the&lt;br&gt;\nbiggest mistake ever.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher=\r\n :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into&lt;br&gt;\nlets =\r\nsay a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,&lt;br&gt;\nor =\r\nacts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Teddy is id=\r\nle, literally useless.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the sa=\r\nme battery that powered the&lt;br&gt;\ncar, it was the same battery that powered t=\r\nhe teddy bear, and it is the&lt;br&gt;\nsame battery that can power any toy, corre=\r\nct?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Correct&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : While the battery is in t=\r\nhe car, it believes itself to be the&lt;br&gt;\ncar. It believes &quot;yesssss, i am a =\r\ncar, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm&lt;br&gt;\ntorque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, en=\r\ngine at the back, hot woman in my&lt;br&gt;\npassengers seat, I am the king baby, =\r\nlook at how hot I am&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: Oh dear god=E2=80=A6.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeac=\r\nher : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a&lt;br&gt;\nuseles=\r\ns piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it&lt;br&gt;\nbeli=\r\neves itself to be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,&lt;br&gt;\nI =\r\nam mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can&lt;br&gt;\ne=\r\nven clap my hands &quot;, and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy&lt;br&gt;\ni=\r\ns=E2=80=A6..&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Useless, and dead.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Thats=\r\n a useless conclusion, it is known by the world, not&lt;br&gt;\nrealized. Every to=\r\nm dick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point&lt;br&gt;\nis the battery c=\r\nonfuses itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So t=\r\nhe battery is the soul?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* W=\r\nho said that?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : You did.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : *another phate=\r\nk on the head of the student* When did I say?&lt;br&gt;\nYou read it in one of you=\r\nr fancy articles and commentaries and satsangs&lt;br&gt;\nthat people do, genius, =\r\nand you read it all too wrong, you read it and&lt;br&gt;\nthus think you &#39;know&#39;, y=\r\nou never practiced, fools you people are. Most&lt;br&gt;\nof the time you people a=\r\nre fed bullshit and you gobble it up like pigs&lt;br&gt;\nin mud. That reminds me =\r\nwe haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  pizza in a long&lt;br&gt;\ntime, lets order one. LOL&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Sorry=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Don&#39;t be, you are my ch=\r\nild, I love you. Anyways , back to our&lt;br&gt;\ndiscussion on toys. The confusio=\r\nn of the battery. And thus Chaman, you&lt;br&gt;\nconfuse yourself to be Chaman. T=\r\nhis is the 67432th time , you have been&lt;br&gt;\nplugged into a a toy (read body=\r\n) and the confusion prevails. Focus on&lt;br&gt;\nthe &quot;confusion&quot; aspect.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nStudent : Then who am I?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You are the ever lasting consc=\r\niousness, the universal bliss,&lt;br&gt;\nthe infinite, the ever pervading light o=\r\nf the universe!!!

LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is&lt;br&gt;\nbasically in essence, and m=\r\nark these all important words.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot; YOU trying to convince yourself that &quot;=\r\nyou&quot; are not YOU &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBirths are spent on this my boy, births not liv=\r\nes, it takes a lot of&lt;br&gt;\neffort to tell and convince yourself that you are=\r\n just not you.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : and how do you do that?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher =\r\n: By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You&lt;br&gt;\neventually you=\r\nrself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus&lt;br&gt;\nrealizing the =\r\ndeity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the&lt;br&gt;\none (the source=\r\n of all the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man&lt;br&gt;\nki tarana, doe=\r\ns it not?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the b=\r\nattery and not&lt;br&gt;\nthis personality?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, but the day &quot;y=\r\nou&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, to&lt;br&gt;\nyourself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: I am be=\r\nginning to understand a little, can you explain where&lt;br&gt;\ndoes a deity stan=\r\nd in this whole battery concept?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : If you are the battery,=\r\n the battery has to have a source, you&lt;br&gt;\nare not svayambhu that you exist=\r\n on you own. The deity is like a huge&lt;br&gt;\npower station in your comparison.=\r\n It is almost infinite, but since it is&lt;br&gt;\na power station it is bound to =\r\nhave a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa&lt;br&gt;\nsized battery it is endless. =\r\nChaman&#39;s source is his parents, but&lt;br&gt;\nchaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery) =\r\nparent is the power station.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that&#39;s why =\r\nshe is worshipped as ma?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or=\r\n a girl who has realized that&lt;br&gt;\nhe/she himself is the battery and then we=\r\nnt on to become one with a&lt;br&gt;\npower station and thus sees himself/herself =\r\nin everything because the&lt;br&gt;\npower station is the source of everything , o=\r\nf all batteries. And since&lt;br&gt;\nhe/she actually knows that all elements too =\r\nare currents and everything&lt;br&gt;\nelse too, he/she actually sees it as that. =\r\nAnd thus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let&lt;br&gt;\nsay I fully well don&#39;t see a difference b=\r\netween me and this table, thus&lt;br&gt;\nI am this table, thus If i wish to make =\r\nit fly, I can do it, because I&lt;br&gt;\nam actually it. To you it is a table, to=\r\n me it is just a current, who is&lt;br&gt;\njust &quot;me&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: Oooohhhhh=\r\nhhh=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but tha=\r\nts how your eyes perceive him&lt;br&gt;\nto be as, an old man with frail clothing,=\r\n belongs to shirdi etc etc, but&lt;br&gt;\ninside he is far beyond what you or I c=\r\nan comprehend. He first realized&lt;br&gt;\nhe was a battery by doing penance, thu=\r\ns killing himself in the process,&lt;br&gt;\nthe he realized that the battery is a=\r\ns good as the power station because&lt;br&gt;\nthe current is the same, so he beca=\r\nme one with that, and then he went&lt;br&gt;\nbeyond and came back to guide as he =\r\nwas chosen, just like many others&lt;br&gt;\nare, like my great teacher, guru nana=\r\nk dev, Ramakrishna and all&lt;br&gt;\nothers=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nS=\r\ntudent : And the source of the power station is?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : The one=\r\n- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put into words&lt;br&gt;\nbecause he is in=\r\nfinite and the words are finite. It is purely on&lt;br&gt;\ndefining him religious=\r\n wars, riots between religions , and intellectual&lt;br&gt;\ndiscussions and debat=\r\nes on this thing called internet happen, but&lt;br&gt;\nhe/she/it is far beyond co=\r\nmprehension. Many people focus on that , and&lt;br&gt;\nget lost, but focus on the=\r\n power station (deity) and it will take you to&lt;br&gt;\nbig daddy.&lt;br&gt;\nImagine a=\r\nn endless field of current in comparison of the power station ,&lt;br&gt;\nan endl=\r\ness current which exists and all others are a figment of it. The&lt;br&gt;\npower =\r\nstations are a part of it, the current has taken the form of one&lt;br&gt;\nconcen=\r\ntrated zone.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck it.&lt;br&gt;\nThe =\r\nultimate is only realized when you are one with the power station so&lt;br&gt;\nle=\r\nts focus there.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So the one has taken forms of different =\r\npower stations to help&lt;br&gt;\nthe batteries who are spread out to help unite b=\r\nack with it?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Brilliant.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: So all our liv=\r\nes we debate/fight and cut each other off to&lt;br&gt;\nclaim which power station =\r\n(deity) is more powerful over the other and&lt;br&gt;\nsuperior to all others, whe=\r\nn in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to&lt;br&gt;\nbe different, when they a=\r\nre in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and&lt;br&gt;\nlaughing back at us?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nT=\r\neacher : ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : And we try to worshi=\r\np 10 different ones and always think that&lt;br&gt;\nwe should worship as many to =\r\nget maximum benefit for our mistakingly&lt;br&gt;\nconfused identities of teddy , =\r\nthe car and all other toys?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I a=\r\nm listening.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: So the biggest fools are those who are lost =\r\nin debates and&lt;br&gt;\npseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with =\r\npeacock feathers&lt;br&gt;\nand punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating o=\r\nn concepts which&lt;br&gt;\nthey don&#39;t know a thing about?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher: Yes,S=\r\npeaking of Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the&lt;br&gt;\nbattery. the stu=\r\npidest thing in the world is this concept of &quot;my&lt;br&gt;\nkundalini&quot;, err=E2=80=\r\n=A6. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,&lt;br&gt;\nmany make this =\r\nerror, but it is essential because other wise you can&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\nexplain the con=\r\ncept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;you&quot; will be =\r\nphat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets&lt;br&gt;\nsay a form, =\r\nyou in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full&lt;br&gt;\nglory . Whateve=\r\nr you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the&lt;br&gt;\nlimitations of C=\r\nhaman/teddy/car/toy.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: So then how do realized souls stay i=\r\nn their bodies post their&lt;br&gt;\nrealization?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher: Intentional id=\r\nentification with the personality by permission&lt;br&gt;\nfrom the power station =\r\nto fulfill some higher purpose of the power&lt;br&gt;\nstation to guide more batte=\r\nries to realize that they are not toys. But&lt;br&gt;\nthey can leave in an instan=\r\nt, because they know realities that are much&lt;br&gt;\nhigher than our world.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : So what is moksha?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : It is a concept that =\r\nis best left alone, if you haven&#39;t merged&lt;br&gt;\nback with a power station you=\r\nrself first. You tell me when you have&lt;br&gt;\nmerged back, how do you know wha=\r\nt if feels like to be merged back? You&lt;br&gt;\nyourself have become one with yo=\r\nur source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even&lt;br&gt;\nthe battery has dissolved, so ho=\r\nw do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remember&lt;br&gt;\nit, because you are not there.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : I can&#39;t explain it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : We can&#39;t, It is =\r\nlike explaining the color red to a blind man.&lt;br&gt;\nYou will say mars  is red=\r\n or the red light is red, he will say I have&lt;br&gt;\nbeen blind from birth I do=\r\nn&#39;t know what you are talking about. You will&lt;br&gt;\nsay tomato, he will say f=\r\nuck off.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher=\r\n : it can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted&lt;br&gt;\ntopic.=\r\n To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy&lt;br&gt;\nis a =\r\nhelicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but&lt;br&gt;\nthe =\r\ncar is very different form the toy, thus if you explain a high level&lt;br&gt;\nco=\r\nncept to both, both will understand differently and have a go at it&lt;br&gt;\nwit=\r\nh debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is both&lt;br&gt;\nr=\r\nealize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are duracell&lt;br&gt;\nf=\r\nirst, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.&lt;br&gt;\nN=\r\now time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : What?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : You thought 4 times.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStude=\r\nnt: But I will be disgraced.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you a=\r\nre duracell, they will laugh at&lt;br&gt;\nChaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation=\r\n, you have done this thousand&lt;br&gt;\ntimes before, so what??&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent =\r\n: I hate you.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : I love you too.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : You are=\r\n serious on this?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Very&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent: : This is why s=\r\nome of the higher ones don&#39;t give a shit about&lt;br&gt;\nroaming naked and doing =\r\nwild stuff, just to keep people away from them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher : Yes, but=\r\n a lot of frauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nStudent : Fine=\r\n, I will do it. But you will handle my parent&#39;s reaction.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeacher =\r\n: Done.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAfter the student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the=\r\n act the next&lt;br&gt;\nday, yet every one saw it that day, and seemed to make fa=\r\nces at the&lt;br&gt;\nstudent for an hour or so. How everybody forgot is a differe=\r\nnt story&lt;br&gt;\naltogether.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDo sadhana, before your battery is pulled=\r\n out, replugged into another&lt;br&gt;\ntoy and yet again, your confusion will pre=\r\nvail driving you to do things&lt;br&gt;\nthat will push you further and further do=\r\nwn.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nJai Shree Radheya!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--31392086-111639513-1345171482=:85245--\r\n\n"}}
