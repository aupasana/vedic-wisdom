For examp=\r\nle, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.\n=A0\nW=\r\ne also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=\r\n Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=\r\n spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=\r\niscipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectiv=\r\nely).\n=A0\nCorrespondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of =\r\nSupreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect op=\r\nerates.\n=A0\nLord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates. =\r\nLord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates.

Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning=\r\n spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - a=\r\nll these are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self =\r\nmanifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays =\r\ndifferent roles. There is no comparison between them.\n=A0\nWe MAY focus on o=\r\nne aspect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it=\r\n. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these dif=\r\nferent aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance worki=\r\nng together in the Cosmos.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n=A0\nOne who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story=\r\n that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualitie=\r\ns of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one w=\r\nho is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonst=\r\nrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste an=\r\nd subjective preference.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n=A0\nLet us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as=\r\n a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It =\r\nis the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.\n=A0\nOnce mind =\r\nfancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the i=\r\nndividualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dha=\r\nrma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized c=\r\nonsciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, di=\r\nscipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/=\r\ndislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s a=\r\ngendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It do=\r\nes all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas no=\r\nr receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized con=\r\nsciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting th=\r\ne fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma=\r\n and does it impassionately.\n=A0\nNow, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not=\r\n to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play,=\r\n may not seem interesting enough to some.\n=A0\nOn the other hand, mind has l=\r\nikes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, gettin=\r\ng things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individua=\r\nlization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the ind=\r\nividualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionatel=\r\ny. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas =\r\nand passion and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind =\r\nis really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life app=\r\neals more to one who may be excited by this description!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nLord Krishna is obviously awe-inspir=\r\ning, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.\n=A0\nRama&#39;s life demonstrate=\r\ns how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishth=\r\na and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vis=\r\nhwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, hi=\r\ns father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his st=\r\nep-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, s=\r\ntep-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supp=\r\norted and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though=\r\n he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the gold=\r\nen deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. =\r\nWhen she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle=\r\n. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana f=\r\nor leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints a=\r\nnd did the best possible action then. Even as\n he killed Ravana, he did so =\r\nwithout hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was=\r\n dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were goi=\r\nng to disappear with Ravana!\n=A0\nRama is a perfect example of a liberated m=\r\nan with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma ar=\r\nising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what=\r\n soul does!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nAs anot=\r\nher example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstrat=\r\nion of how wisdom/discrimination operates.\n=A0\nHe was born as a learned pyg=\r\nmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king wit=\r\nh many great qualities.\n=A0\nWisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unas=\r\nsuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g=\r\n. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that prid=\r\ne is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic=\r\n qualities are completely suppressed.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nPlease think about the other avataras. The stories can b=\r\ne understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consci=\r\nousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.\n=A0\nLet us not comp=\r\nare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you a=\r\nre more attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and =\r\ndevelop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.\n=A0\n*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBy the way, happy Hanuma=\r\njjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of th=\r\nought).\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resou=\r\nrces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n--------\r\n---851882195-1803346418-1366860641=:80829\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\nere was a discussion on Lord Vishnu&#39;s Dasavataras on a limited access forum=\r\n on Facebook.
