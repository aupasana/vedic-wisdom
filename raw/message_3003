Being young, he had\ntresses of hair hanging down to the shoulders. Ma=\r\ny be he wanted to appear\nfashionable. As soon as he came into the hall and =\r\ngot up after prostrating,\nBhagavan said, =93Oh, is that you? When I saw you=\r\nr hair style, I thought it\nwas somebody else. Oh! My! How you look! Who wou=\r\nld believe that you are the\nson of Jagadeeswara Sastri?=94 The boy was so a=\r\nshamed, that he came to the\nhall next day with only a small tuft of hair be=\r\nhind.Noticing it, Bhagavan\nsaid, =93Yes. That is right. Will not people cri=\r\nticise adversely if\nJagadeeswara Sastri=92s son, a bachelor living in a Gur=\r\nukula (the house of a\nGuru), has an unbecoming hair style?=94\n\nIn 1943, Gur=\r\nram Subbaramayya Garu came here with his daughter of five or six\nyears of a=\r\nge. As you know, she had no mother. Noticing that she had a plait\nof hair o=\r\nn either side of her head, Bhagavan remarked, =93What child! Only two\nplait=\r\ns? Why not have two more in front and two in the centre of the head?=94\nSo =\r\nsaying Bhagavan laughed.Bhagavan had passed similar remarks before\nwhenever=\r\n he saw other children dressed up like this. Now this child felt\nashamed, c=\r\name to me,got her hair done into a single plait and went to\nBhagavan.Smilin=\r\ng at it and saying it was good, Bhagavan told her father,\n=93Look, European=\r\n ladies who come here, wear sarees, tie their hair in a plait\nand put some =\r\nflowers in it and thus try to appear like our ladies, while our\npeople try =\r\nto adopt their style. What to do?=94\n\nSometime in 1943-44, a European by na=\r\nme Mr. McIver used to live here; on a\nDipavali day, he wore a Salem silkbor=\r\ndered dhoti in the orthodox style,\ncovered the upper\nportion of his body wi=\r\nth a similar cloth, prostrated before Bhagavan, put on\nhis forehead holy as=\r\nhes and kumkum, went out of the hall and sat there with\nclosed eyes in padm=\r\nasana style. Bhagavan began smiling to himself, looking\nat him through the =\r\nwindow. Meanwhile Rajagopala Iyer came into the hall,\nwhereupon Bhagavan, l=\r\naughing loudly, exclaimed, =93Look at that. McIver Sastri\nhas come here. Th=\r\nere he is,sitting over there. Really, if anyone were to see\nhim now,could t=\r\nhey say he was not a Sastri? While all of you put on suits\nand boots, inste=\r\nad of wearing dhoties, he dressed himself up like a Sastri.\nThe only thing =\r\nthat is wanting now is the sacred thread. As our people are\ndiscarding even=\r\n that, there is no difficulty even on that score now. Look at\nhim!=94\n\nWhen=\r\never Bhagavan speaks to native Indians, he normally talks to them in\ntheir =\r\nown language, namely Tamil,Telugu or Malayalam, but never in English.\nEven =\r\nthough they know this, some of our young men put their questions to\nBhagava=\r\nn in English. Sometimes, there will be nobody to translate or the\ntranslati=\r\non will be found difficult. If on such occasions, we enquire why\nthose peop=\r\nle could not put their questions in their own language, Bhagavan\nwould say,=\r\n =93You want to know why they ask me in English? That is because\nthey want =\r\nto test Bhagavan. They have gained some knowledge of the English\nlanguage. =\r\nShould not all people know about it? Not only that, they sincerely\nbelieve =\r\nthat their language is no good for such an important matter. The\ninfatuatio=\r\nn for that language makes them feel like that.
