We are hesitant=\r\n to give money the very thought what if she is a con what if she is evil mi=\r\nnded etc comes in our mind. Why do these thoughts make the way because of o=\r\nur attachment towards money? Who cares give the money and let God take care=\r\n of it. There are similar tests Mother takes and they become difficult as o=\r\nne progresses. Also be warned mother punishes those who fail. Hence the fac=\r\nt that one need not fear mother and keep praying is wrong. Just like a kid =\r\nthat won&#39;t listen until a fear is instilled in his mind similarly sadhakas =\r\nwon&#39;t reform the ways if there is no fear instilled in our mind. Hence fear=\r\n is needed,=C2=A0Keep praying her with devotion, 100% surrender=C2=A0to her=\r\n at the same time fight the internal enemies=C2=A0is what I have learned so=\r\n far. \n=C2=A0\nAlso I disagree with the fact that one should ignore the test=\r\ns. These tests are similar to the one we take in college exams. One has to =\r\nbe prepared for it mentally. Without preparation one will keep failing and =\r\nmake no progress. \n=C2=A0\nComing to the point why tests are needed ...they =\r\nare needed to cleanse our souls.=C2=A0Only with soul cleansing one can come=\r\n=C2=A0closer to God. =C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nLike I said I am very inferior in my thi=\r\nnking and maybe wrong.

And if she does not know her bhakt, how can she be=\r\n the\nshakti to\n&gt; &gt; rule over all?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tests which people refer to a=\r\nre usually the hardships that one\nhas to face\n&gt; &gt; while undertaking a sadha=\r\nna. When one performs a sadhana, it is only\nto achieve\n&gt; &gt; some goal whethe=\r\nr that be spiritual or material objective and the\nneed for\n&gt; &gt; sadhana is b=\r\necuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be\nable\n&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 =\r\nachive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a\nsadhana is to remov=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does not\nl=\r\net anyone\n&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The harships that you face while performi=\r\nng a\nsadhana might\n&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially=\r\n the Lord\nbringing necessary\n&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates the suffe=\r\nring in the sadhaka that\nlets the\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The s=\r\nadhaka will eventually be\nsuccessful but\n&gt; &gt; the effort required and the ha=\r\nrdships that are yet to be faced\ndepends on the\n&gt; &gt; karmic burden.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIf the karmic burden is less, suffering is less and success is\nobtained wit=\r\nhout\n&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very=\r\n\nheavy, you\n&gt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though you are now c=\r\nloser to\nyour goal\n&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not achie=\r\nved, you do not\nsee the\n&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the effort was =\r\na waste.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brought to your way =\r\nby her to\npurge you\n&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what you want.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; This is my belief, and this I use as a basis when performing a\nsadhana.

Although I am inferior to all of you but still I wo=\r\nuld like to offer my two cents.&nbsp; I believe the karmic blockages one su=\r\nffers are not tests. The real tests are the one that God takes to check on =\r\nour internal enemies.&nbsp; It is easy to tackle the&nbsp;karmic blockage&n=\r\nbsp;but not easy to pass these tests .&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There h=\r\nave been examples where members quoted how they were standing in a stall an=\r\nd suddenly a woman came up to him asking for money. We are hesitant to give=\r\n money the very thought what if she is a con what if she is evil minded etc=\r\n comes in our mind. Why do these thoughts make the way because of our attac=\r\nhment towards money? Who cares give the money and let God take care of it. =\r\nThere are similar tests Mother takes and they become difficult as one progr=\r\nesses. Also be warned mother punishes those who fail. Hence the fact that o=\r\nne need not fear mother and keep praying is wrong. Just like a kid that won=\r\n&#39;t listen until a fear is instilled in his mind similarly sadhakas won&#39;t re=\r\nform the ways if there is no fear instilled in our mind. Hence fear is need=\r\ned,&nbsp;Keep praying her with devotion, 100% surrender&nbsp;to her at the =\r\nsame time fight the internal enemies&nbsp;is what I have learned so far. &lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also I disagree with the fact that one should i=\r\ngnore the tests. These tests are similar to the one we take in college exam=\r\ns. One has to be prepared for it mentally. Without preparation one will kee=\r\np failing and make no progress. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Coming to the=\r\n point why tests are needed ...they are needed to cleanse our souls.&nbsp;O=\r\nnly with soul cleansing one can come&nbsp;closer to God. &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Like I said I am very inferior in my thinking and maybe w=\r\nrong.

by Shakthi.&lt;BR&gt;To put more mor=\r\ne clearly, one performs the spiritual sadhana keeping in mind&nbsp; one&#39;s&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&quot;ishta devata&quot; to enhance one&#39;s soul to the higher self.&nbsp; It is only=\r\n fringe benefits if one&lt;BR&gt;come across materialistic benefits in the proces=\r\ns.&nbsp; The main aim and success is only to enhance one&#39;s soul to the high=\r\ner plane.&nbsp; Any test or sufferings by the physical body in no way affec=\r\nt the enhancement of the soul.&nbsp; The physical body suffers because the =\r\nKarma&lt;BR&gt;one has done.&nbsp; But it is to be understood, any spritual sadha=\r\nna has got great potential&lt;BR&gt;not only to enhance the soul; but also bestow=\r\n the materialistic benefits, just like that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hence it is absolutely =\r\nnecessary to continue the spiritual process instead of diverting the &lt;BR&gt;en=\r\nergies by thinking about &#39;test&#39; and &#39;problems which will automatically gran=\r\nt\n the material&lt;BR&gt;benefits also.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With love&lt;BR&gt;SS&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;F=\r\nri, 10/1/10, krishna Kanth &lt;I&gt;&lt;kritels@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

But what can be&lt;BR&gt;said after&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some logical thinking i=\r\ns that if needs to &quot;test&quot; her bhakts on some&lt;BR&gt;matter, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; o=\r\nbviously she does not know her bhakt becuase otherwise there would&lt;BR&gt;be no=\r\n need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for a test. And if she does not know her bhakt, how can =\r\nshe be the&lt;BR&gt;shakti to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rule over all?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; The tests which people refer to are usually the hardships that one&lt;BR&gt;ha=\r\ns to face&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while undertaking a sadhana. When one performs a sad=\r\nhana, it is only&lt;BR&gt;to\n achieve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some goal whether that be spir=\r\nitual or material objective and the&lt;BR&gt;need for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana is bec=\r\nuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be&lt;BR&gt;able&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n to=C3=82 achive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a&lt;BR&gt;sadhan=\r\na is to remove&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. L=\r\naw of karma does not&lt;BR&gt;let anyone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The har=\r\nships that you face while performing a&lt;BR&gt;sadhana might&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; appear=\r\n like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially the Lord&lt;BR&gt;bringing necessa=\r\nry&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates the suffering in the sadha=\r\nka that&lt;BR&gt;lets the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhak=\r\na will eventually be&lt;BR&gt;successful but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the effort required and=\r\n the hardships that are yet to be faced&lt;BR&gt;depends on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karm=\r\nic burden.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If the karmic burden is less, sufferin=\r\ng is less and\n success is&lt;BR&gt;obtained without&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; much suffering (=\r\nrelatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very&lt;BR&gt;heavy, you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though you are now closer to&lt;BR&gt;y=\r\nour goal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not achiev=\r\ned, you do not&lt;BR&gt;see the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the =\r\neffort was a waste.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hards=\r\nhips are brought to your way by her to&lt;BR&gt;purge you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karmically=\r\n to let you achieve what you want.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is my bel=\r\nief, and this I use as a basis when performing a&lt;BR&gt;sadhana. I am&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; sure others may have other views though.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rega=\r\nrds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: pari=\r\njat_d parijat_d@&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Wed, September 29, 2010 4:20:17 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A query&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; i am parijat dutta from kolkata.there are some =\r\nissues going on i&lt;BR&gt;need to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; discuss..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; since i was 18-19,i became interested in tantras.and i worship ma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://kali.bt/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;kali.bt&lt;/A&gt; i feel&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; i had and may be have to face several tests....like initially.=\r\n..i&lt;BR&gt;read books on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tantra....wich promise highly materialist=\r\nically beneficial&lt;BR&gt;sadhanas..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and alarmingly different dieti=\r\nes for each purpose...i fell for&lt;BR&gt;that...an my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; devotion was =\r\ndivided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; with time i realized all these have no value without a gurus&lt;BR&gt;guidance.=\r\n....my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; astrologer told\n me....that time will be arnd 29-30 of =\r\nmy age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then again...i was against krishna worshi=\r\np.....cuzz i thot&lt;BR&gt;fooshingly since he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is only about love(bh=\r\nakti)....he may not be strong like devis..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; again since...all t=\r\nhe tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship&lt;BR&gt;is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hi=\r\nghest....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; un&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; also...at that time..i didnot like r=\r\namkrishna dev since he talked&lt;BR&gt;mostly of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; devotion...n not of=\r\n powers like siddhis....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; undestanding others thoughts n so on.=\r\n..as i have personally seen&lt;BR&gt;some tantrics&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; who have this pow=\r\ner..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with time again i learnt bhakti is the highe=\r\nst.......i asked once a&lt;BR&gt;maharaj who&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; presides over the ashra=\r\nm where my mother was initiated ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; which is more powerful ??
