The \n&gt; imagery is very =\r\npowerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Om! Verily, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse; =\r\nthe \nsun, \n&gt; his eye; the wind his breath; universal fire, his open mouth. =\r\nThe \nyear \n&gt; is the body; the sky, his back; the atmosphere his belly; the =\r\n\nearth, \n&gt; the underpart of his belly; the quarters his flanks; the \ninterm=\r\nediate \n&gt; quarters, his ribs; the seasons his limbs; the months and half \nm=\r\nonths \n&gt; his joints; the days and night his fee; the stars his bones; the \n=\r\nclouds \n&gt; his flesh. Sand is the food inhis stomach; rivers are his entrail=\r\ns. \nHis \n&gt; liver and lungs are the mountains; plants and trees his hair. Th=\r\ne \n&gt; orient is his fore part; the occident his hind part. When he yawns \nth=\r\nen \n&gt; it lightens. Whe he shakes himself it thunders. When he urinates \nthe=\r\nn \n&gt; it rains. Voice indeed is his voice&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If one lets the imagination =\r\ngo wild then the concept of birth \n(dawn) / \n&gt; rising ascendant, (and there=\r\nfore also death of the sacrificial \nhorse?); \n&gt; the atman; the elements; th=\r\ne space; the time; the energies; the \n&gt; physical; the five senses; everythi=\r\nng appears to be there. in the \nvery \n&gt; first shloka.\n&gt; \n&gt; The theme of sac=\r\nrifice / sacrificial oblations, etc. occur again \nand \n&gt; agian throughout t=\r\nhe text of this Upanishad.\n&gt; \n&gt; My questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; why, is it essential=\r\n to use imagination to understand what is \nwritten? \n&gt; Does that mean that =\r\neach person has to experience the meaning on \nhis or \n&gt; her own depending o=\r\nn his or her awareness? Then the question is how \n&gt; real is imagination? Ca=\r\nn we depend on it to understand things? \n&gt; correctly? The shlokas appear to=\r\n be so  multi-layered /multi-\n&gt; dimensional that there is no &quot;logical&quot; way =\r\nto understand them \n(assuming \n&gt; of course, that imagination does not relat=\r\ne to logic)!\n&gt; \n&gt; But most important of all: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SACR=\r\nIFICE IN \n&gt; EXISTENCE??? WHY THE SYMBOL OF ASHWA MEDHA?\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it have s=\r\nomething to do with movement from gross to the \nsubtle? \n&gt; Self purificatio=\r\nn?\n&gt; \n&gt; Would love to hear the views of others.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
