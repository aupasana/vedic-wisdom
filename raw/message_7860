I will give a couple of simple examples from real-life, of \nhow that happens and how we need to be alert to conserve prana.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI am scared of dogs. I walk for about 20 minutes after lunch. When I was \nwalking oneday, a couple of fierce looking dogs in the backyard of a \nhouse starting barking at me really loud. Though there was a fence, they \nwere shaking it and trying to climb it. I was scared, but kept walking. \nMy pulse and breathing became a little irregular and some negative \nchemicals were produced in my body, which would affect me possibly for a \nfew days! While I was feeling very nice before this, I started to feel \nweak and uncomfortable. I wasted some prana (life force) in this \nexperience and mind lost its balance!\n\nAs long as conditioning remains in my chitta that &quot;this body should not \nbe hurt at any cost&quot;, it is natural to protest (mentally and even \nphysically if needed) any attack on the body.\n\nEven if such conditioning is left, a useful behavior is to ignore the \ndogs and possibly chalk up a plan on what to do in case dogs overcome \nthe fence, i.e. should one run or fight or climb a tree or whatever. It \nis a useless behavior to just imagine things, speculate and worry.\n\nWhat is worse is that I went on the same road next day. Even though dogs \nwere not in the backyard, I remembered the previous day and started to \nworry. Remembering the previous experience made the mind spend some \nenergy on unpleasant scenarios and lose prana. My breathing again became \nirregular and I felt weak and uncomfortable. The weird thing here is \nthat dogs were not even in the backyard this time.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI&#39;ll give one more example. I had an important meeting in the morning. I \nstarted a little late and got stuck in traffic. While I drove to work, I \nworried all the way that I may be late for the meeting. I speculated on \nseveral possible outcomes. All this activity expended my praana and \ndisturbed my mental equanimity. In the end, I discovered on reaching \nwork that a few other people were stuck in traffic and the meeting was \npostponed. All my worry was pointless.\n\nAs a matter of fact, even if meeting happened on time and I was late, \nall my worrying while driving would not have helped me at all. If I \nthought being late would have bad consequences, I should&#39;ve thought of \nwhat was in my hand then, i.e. what I could do. For example, call \nsomeone and make some arrangement to cover for me, or call someone and \nask to delay the meeting, etc.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThough my examples are trivial, one may encounter more serious cases. \nSuppose someone observes something with one&#39;s health and starts \nspeculating that it may be a serious disease (e.g. cancer). If one has \ndoubt, one can read up and estimate the probability. If one thinks it is \na serious possibility, one can go to a doctor and get checked. But, some \npeople do not engage in such actions that are in their control, but keep \nspeculating and worrying. With a constant depletion of praana in such \nworries and spending of praana in those thoughts, one may indeed develop \nthat disease too!\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen there is an action to be taken, we can consider all options and \npick the best action. When there is no action to be taken, we can \nconsider the possible cases that may arise in future and pick the best \nactions in different cases. Such activity based on &quot;what can I do and \nwhat should I do&quot; is a useful way to expend prana.\n\nBut, sadly, we expend prana in a lot of activity that is NOT based on \n&quot;what can I do and what should I do&quot;. We imagine pleasant situations and \nget overexcited, we imagine unpleasant situations and get worried and so \non. All that mental activity directs the life force of mind to various \nobjects and their play (which happens in the mind!) and expends a lot of \nprana.\n\n*        *        *\n\nFocus on what is your hand. Focus on your actions. Try your best to not \nthink too much about things not in your control. Speculation about \nfuture should be strictly from the point of view of considering possible \nscenarios for identifying possible actions and preparing oneself for \nthose. Consideration of past should be strictly from the point of view \nof considering how previous actions played out and learning lessons for \ncurrent and future actions.\n\nActions are in your hand. Focus your attention on your actions. What \ncomes to you is not in your hands. Don&#39;t expend too much praana \nspeculating on what is out of your control.\n\nHappy MahaShivaRatri!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
