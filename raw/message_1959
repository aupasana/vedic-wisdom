I \nwill write more on this later.\n\nFor now, I wanted to challenge the planet-mahavidya map people have been \nusing, which is based on piecemeal kind of explanations based on superficial \nfactors of symbols and extraneous details, without a uniform philosophical \nbasis and without scriptural basis either.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana Rao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 09, 2009 3:50 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Consorts of Dasa Mahavidyas Given in Todala \nTantra\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; The thread is very interesting and enlightening.\n&gt;\n&gt; How ever, I have one reservation with some of your argument. A=B, B=C and \n&gt; hence A=C is not always correct statement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let us take an example:\n&gt; A does a bad karma to B\n&gt; As per adwaita, A=Brahman.\n&gt; B = Brahman\n&gt; C = Brahman and hence Brahman = C\n&gt; A has done bad to B. B = Brahman. Hence, A has done bad to Brahman. As \n&gt; Brahman is C, A has done bad to C.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this logic incorrect? Not really, but, it is not correct also.\n&gt;\n&gt; To argue, Kali = Krishna, using Kali=Moon, Moon=Krishna and hence \n&gt; Kali=Krishna is not a fully correct argument. How ever, this could be an \n&gt; argument give proper consideration to the statement that Kali=Krishna. How \n&gt; ever, in my opinion, this is not a conluding argument.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of main duty Krishna served was destruction. He played to ensure that \n&gt; there is a battle and that mass destruction happened. He allowed his \n&gt; beloved die with out any attachment and infact instrumental in some of \n&gt; those deaths (Ghatotkaca for example).\n&gt;\n&gt; How ever, I keep wondering why Krishna saved Parikhit (son of Abhimanyu \n&gt; and Uttara) (who was killed by Brahmasironamakastra from Aswathama).\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

People here know better than that.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I never talked of superficial things such as &quot;complexion&quot;. Moreover, you \n&gt;&gt; are replacing Kaalika with crows in your sircasm and making fun really of \n&gt;&gt; Tantra and Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s another list for you from Todala Tantra:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;see below for list&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; These are the Mahavidya (left) and their spouses (right side). See that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mahatripurasundari&#39;s spouse is Somanatha, and surely the name \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Soma-Natha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; implies that he is the Jyotirlinga associated with the Moon. But in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; list Moon is Kali, so where are we at now with the logic you used and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the list you have derived?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Instead of getting caught in superficial and extraneous factors, let us \n&gt;&gt; go to the crux.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mahavidyas and their consorts are not showing the same thing, but two \n&gt;&gt; different things that have a synergy. The list of planets mapping to \n&gt;&gt; mahavidyas and those mapping to mahavidya consorts will accordingly have \n&gt;&gt; to be different. I will elaborate with examples.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each mahavidya represents one form of liberating supreme knowledge that \n&gt;&gt; helps one overcome duality and become liberated, starting from different \n&gt;&gt; vantage points within duality and approaching liberation from them. \n&gt;&gt; Consorts are the factors that aid in that approach.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, Kaali is equated to Krishna by Munda Maalaa Tantra and \n&gt;&gt; Krishna is equated to Moon by Parasara. So Kaali is shown by Moon. From \n&gt;&gt; the perspective of Moon (mind), this duality is a very troublesome \n&gt;&gt; temptation and the way to overcome it is to realize its impermanence and \n&gt;&gt; destroy the duality so that it cannot tempt again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; During this process, the ideal companion of Moon is Saturn (vairagya and \n&gt;&gt; discipline). So the consort of Kaali shown by Moon is Mahakala shown by \n&gt;&gt; Saturn.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Take Taaraa. She is equated to Raama by Munda Maalaa Tantra and Raama is \n&gt;&gt; equated to Sun by Parasara. So Taaraa is shown by Sun. From the \n&gt;&gt; perspective of Sun (soul), this duality is an ocean of delusion that \n&gt;&gt; needs to be waded across to reach the supreme cosmic soul.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; During this process, the ideal companion of Sun is Jupiter (intelligence \n&gt;&gt; and discrimination). Just as rajaguru (Jupiter) guides king (Sun), the \n&gt;&gt; intellect and discrimination will aid soul in the process of wading the \n&gt;&gt; ocean of duality and reaching the supreme. So the consort of Taaraa shown \n&gt;&gt; by Sun is Akshobhya shown by Jupiter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Take Chhinnamasta. She is equated to Bhaargava Raama by Munda Maalaa \n&gt;&gt; Tantra and Bhaargava Raama is equated to Venus by Parasara. So \n&gt;&gt; Chhinnamasta is shown by Venus. From the perspective of Venus \n&gt;&gt; (enjoyment), this duality needs to be enjoyed and not run away from. The \n&gt;&gt; symbolism behind Chhinnamasta depicted accompanied by a naked couple in \n&gt;&gt; copulation and associates drinking wine is that nothing is impure and all \n&gt;&gt; is Brahman. That is the take of Venus (enjoyment).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; During this process, the ideal companion of Venus (enjoyment) is Ketu \n&gt;&gt; (detachment and egolessness). Only when the enjoyment is gone through \n&gt;&gt; without ego and identification can it be conducive to liberation. So the \n&gt;&gt; consort of Chhinnamasta shown by Venus is Shiva-Kabandha shown by Ketu. \n&gt;&gt; Kabandha means the headless one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As Dhumaavati is shown by Jupiter (dhee, i.e. intellect and \n&gt;&gt; discrimination), there is no need for a companion. If the force of dhee \n&gt;&gt; is there, one realizes that all is god and does not distinguish between \n&gt;&gt; good and bad, happy and sad etc and becomes liberated easily. One with a \n&gt;&gt; strong aatmabala or manobala can waver and may need supplementing \n&gt;&gt; influences, but one with a strong dheeshakti is fine. There is no \n&gt;&gt; supplementing influence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now let us take your example. Mahatripuarasundari is equated to Kalki by \n&gt;&gt; Munda Mala Tantra and Kalki is equated to lagna by Maharshi Parasara. So \n&gt;&gt; Tripura is lagna.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While Sun and Moon show the soul and mind, lagna shows the individualized \n&gt;&gt; consciousness through which we operate in the world. It includes body and \n&gt;&gt; more. It is lagna through which we act in the world. From the point of \n&gt;&gt; view of lagna, duality is to be overcome by doing what is expected from \n&gt;&gt; us by Nature and engaging in actions. Tripura personifies the supreme \n&gt;&gt; liberating knowledge of using the individualized consciousness to engage \n&gt;&gt; in perfect actions in the world to liberate oneself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, the most useful companion of lagna in this process is Moon (mind). \n&gt;&gt; The actor within you (lagna) needs mind as mind tells the actor what to \n&gt;&gt; do. Thus, the ideal companion of lagna is Moon. Accordingly, the consort \n&gt;&gt; of Mahatripurasundari shown by lagna is Somanatha shown by Moon.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can find similar logic for all of them. Here is the full list:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1. Kaali (Moon) - Mahaa Kaala (Saturn)\n&gt;&gt; 2. Taaraa (Sun) - Akshobhya (Jupiter)\n&gt;&gt; 3. Mahatripurisundari (Lagna) - Somanaatha (Moon)\n&gt;&gt; 4. Bhuvaneswari (Rahu) - Tryambaka (Venus)\n&gt;&gt; 5. Bhairavi (Mars) - Dakshinaamurti (Sun)\n&gt;&gt; 6. Chhinamastaa (Venus) - Shiva-Kabandha (Ketu)\n&gt;&gt; 7. Dhumavati (Jupiter) - None\n&gt;&gt; 8. Bagalaamukhi (Saturn) - Mahaa Rudra (Mars)\n&gt;&gt; 9. Maatangi (Mercury) - Shiva Maatanga (Rahu)\n&gt;&gt; 10. Kamalatmika (Ketu) - Vishnurupi Sadaashiva (Mercury)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Short notes on the ones I did not cover before:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bhairavi represents the path of Mars, i.e. viewing the duality as a \n&gt;&gt; challenge that needs to be fought hard and fearlessly and not fear \n&gt;&gt; anything, including death and pain. The ideal companion is aatmabala, \n&gt;&gt; represented by Sun, just as a good king (Sun) is an ideal supplement for \n&gt;&gt; a good commander (Mars).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bagalaamukhi represents the path of Saturn, i.e. viewing the duality as \n&gt;&gt; that which results from one&#39;s own weaknesses, sins and internal enemies \n&gt;&gt; and seeing a conquest of internal enemies as the key to overcoming \n&gt;&gt; duality. The fighting spirit represented by Mars is the ideal companion \n&gt;&gt; in the process of overcoming enemies. Mahaa Rudra shown by Mars is hence \n&gt;&gt; the consort of Bagalamukhi.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Maatangi represents the path of Mercury, i.e. viewing the duality as that \n&gt;&gt; which needs to be learnt, understood, mastered and then overcome. Free \n&gt;&gt; thinking without boundaries, represented by Rahu, is the ideal companion \n&gt;&gt; in this path. Maatanga means free spirited one or free roamer and Shiva \n&gt;&gt; Maatanga is such a form of Shiva. He is the consort of Maatangi.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Friends, there may be an outcry to my writings from astrologers used to a \n&gt;&gt; different planet-mahavidya map (which is NOT sanctioned by any scripture \n&gt;&gt; and yet popular today in some circles). I may not be able to respond to \n&gt;&gt; all the mails.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But please do bear in mind that there is a simple and uniform philosophy \n&gt;&gt; behind the concept of Mahavidyas. Flowery expositions without a uniform \n&gt;&gt; philosophy and even a basic uniform understanding of what Mahavidyas are \n&gt;&gt; for are useless. If you are told logic like &quot;Tripurasundari holds \n&gt;&gt; sugarcane. Mercury shows sugar cane. So Tripurasundari is shown by \n&gt;&gt; Mercury&quot;, reject such superficial logic. If somebody tells you that a \n&gt;&gt; mahavidya is for winning lawsuits or for getting power or getting wealth, \n&gt;&gt; reject such things.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please remember that mahavidyas are forms of *supreme liberating \n&gt;&gt; knowledge*. The path to liberation looks different from the point of view \n&gt;&gt; of different planets.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Visti Larsen &lt;visti@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ??? ??? ?????\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, Namaskar.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Great... so because crows are black, as is Krishna&#39;s complexion, so\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Crows and Krishna are both Moon.

This is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proper logic, in fact when we were taught the Agni Purana on the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year of Jaimini Sutras, and the names of Vishnu therein, we saw a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely different concept of mapping of the grahas to the name \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; avataras.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This mapping that Narasimha has suggested is simply not acceptable\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is too simple an explanation, and doesn&#39;t bring out the real \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; importance\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as to how the Mahavidya and Vishnu Avatara are connected. I.e. how \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left foot corresponds to Tara and the right hand corresponds to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whilst the right foot is Kali and the left hand is Krishna and how \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hands and feet walk together in sync showing the Gati (feet) and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (hands) that are connected. This itself was taught to us on the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; first year.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yours sincerely, Visti Larsen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish Guru (Vedic Astrologer)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; www: http://srigaruda.com &lt;http://srigaruda.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; @: visti@\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Original mail:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narayan,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the verse from Munda Maalaa Tantra. Out of all \n&gt;&gt; &gt; planet-mahavidya\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mappings I have seen, this is the most philosophically sound mapping.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sun - Taaraa - Raama\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Moon - Kaali - Krishna\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mars - Bhairavi - Nrisimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mercury - Maatangi - Buddha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jupiter - Dhumaavati - Vaamana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Venus - Chhinnamastaa - Bhaargava Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Saturn - Bagalamukhi - Koorma\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rahu - Bhuvaneswari - Varaaha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ketu - Kamala - Matsya\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Vidya is knowledge. Mahavidya is supreme knowledge. Dasa mahavidyas are \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ten highest forms of knowledge that take us to moksha or liberation,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; approaching from different angles. Other kinds of knowledge (e.g.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mathematics, physics, astronomy, astrology, grammar etc) do not \n&gt;&gt; &gt; liberate us.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But these ten kinds of knowledge liberate us. The deities (names and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; forms\n&gt;&gt; &gt; described in books for ten mahavidyas) are personifications of those \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ten\n&gt;&gt; &gt; types of supreme knowledge that liberate us.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Please note one thing here. Moksha means overcoming the maayaa of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; duality around us. Seeing some things as desirable, some as \n&gt;&gt; &gt; undesirable,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some as pleasurable, some as painful, some as beautiful, some as ugly \n&gt;&gt; &gt; etc is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what binds us. Overcoming the duality and seeing all as Brahman is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; liberation or moksha.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Different planets represent different aspects of our selves. The \n&gt;&gt; &gt; duality\n&gt;&gt; &gt; around us and the way to overcome it seem different from different \n&gt;&gt; &gt; angles.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From the point of view of individual soul (Sun), this maayaa is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; something\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that needs to be overcome by crossing and reaching the other end \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (supreme\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cosmic soul). From the point of view of mind (Moon), this duality is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something that clouds the vision and needs to be destroyed so that it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; cannot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tempt again. From the point of view of the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; intellect/discrimination/dhee\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (Jupiter), it issomething that is non-existent anyway (&quot;so what was the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problem in the first place?&quot;), like shapes made of smoke. From the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; point of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; view of initiative and energy within us (Mars), it is something that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; needs\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to be fought hard and fearlessly. From the point of view of the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; learning\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ability within us (Mercury), it is something that needs to be learnt \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; understood fully so that we can overcome it. From the point of view of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enjoyment and happiness (Venus), it is something that needs to be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; accepted\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and enjoyed and not something to fear or avoid (&quot;after all, all is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Brahman.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Then why stay away from enjoyments?&quot;). And so on.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But remember one important thing. Whichever approach is taken to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; overcoming\n&gt;&gt; &gt; duality, the end result is the same. One first masters the approach. It\n&gt;&gt; &gt; becomes part of one&#39;s common sense and thinking. One eventually \n&gt;&gt; &gt; overcomes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; duality. One becomes self-realized and becomes liberated. That end \n&gt;&gt; &gt; result is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the same irrespective of the approach chosen.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sun is the soul within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from \n&gt;&gt; &gt; delving\n&gt;&gt; &gt; deep into this aspect is what makes one wade (tar=swim/wade/cross) the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ocean\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of delusion and get to the source. If you master the knowledge that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; helps\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one view the world as an ocean that needs to be crossed to reach the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; supreme, other things will follow and you eventually get liberation. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Taaraa\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personifies this knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Moon is the mind within us. The highest form of knowledge coming from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; delving deep into this aspect is an understanding of attachments and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, their impermanence and how to kill them. If you master the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge that kills all attachments and desires and gives perfect \n&gt;&gt; &gt; control\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on the mind, other things will follow and you eventually get \n&gt;&gt; &gt; liberation.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kaali personifies this knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mars is the energy and initiative within us. The highest form of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt;&gt; &gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives one \n&gt;&gt; &gt; fearlessness of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; anything in the universe. If you master the knowledge that makes you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; utterly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fearless and you do not fear anything (including death or pain!) other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things will follow and you eventually get liberation. Bhairavi \n&gt;&gt; &gt; personifies\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mercury is knowledge and learning ability within us. The highest form \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; learning of various topics. If you master the knowledge that give you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mastery of all kinds of learning through logical and rational thinking,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other things will follow and you eventually get liberation. Maatangi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personifies this knowledge. In fact, some people associate Maatangi \n&gt;&gt; &gt; with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Saraswati. Saraswati is also known as &quot;Maatanga Kanya&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jupiter is the intellect, wisdom and discrimination (dhee shakti) \n&gt;&gt; &gt; within us.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The highest form of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that all is delusion. The individual soul and individual mind and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt;&gt; &gt; they perceive is just an illusion. All that is there is Brahman. Any \n&gt;&gt; &gt; other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perceptions, of various good or bad things, are just a delusion, like\n&gt;&gt; &gt; figures made of smoke. If you master the knowledge that makes your \n&gt;&gt; &gt; intellect\n&gt;&gt; &gt; shine, you will realize that the entire world is a delusion and not \n&gt;&gt; &gt; deluded\n&gt;&gt; &gt; by anything anymore. Then other things will follow and you eventually \n&gt;&gt; &gt; get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; liberation. Dhumaavati personifies this knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Venus is the spirit of enjoyment and bliss. The highest form of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt;&gt; &gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what makes one egoless and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; blissful. If you master the knowledge that makes you utterly fearless \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you do not fear anything, including death or pain, other things will \n&gt;&gt; &gt; follow\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and you eventually get liberation. Chhinnamasta personifies this \n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She is depicted as a deity holding her own severed head, standing near \n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; naked couple in copulation and surrounded by associates who are \n&gt;&gt; &gt; drinking\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wine. One mastering this knowledge need not stay away from any \n&gt;&gt; &gt; pleasures,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but one learns to see god even those pleasures. However, pleasure \n&gt;&gt; &gt; obtained\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with an ego (&quot;*I* am enjoying this act or object&quot;) binds. The headless \n&gt;&gt; &gt; state\n&gt;&gt; &gt; symbolizes egolessness. If one has overcome I-ness, pleasures are not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; binding. One not thinking in terms of &quot;*I* am enjoying&quot; but having no \n&gt;&gt; &gt; sense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of &quot;I&quot; can live life without running away from any pleasures or \n&gt;&gt; &gt; undertaking\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any austerities and yet become liberated.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Saturn is the spirit of hard work within us. He also represents our\n&gt;&gt; &gt; weaknesses and sins. The highest form of knowledge coming from delving \n&gt;&gt; &gt; deep\n&gt;&gt; &gt; into this aspect is what makes us realize our internal enemies and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; destroy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; them. If you master the knowledge that makes you overcome weaknesses \n&gt;&gt; &gt; such as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; laziness and internal enemies such as lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things will follow and you eventually get liberation. Bagalamukhi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personifies this knowledge. Most of her mantras ask to destroy enemies \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so people foolishly think that she is the one who gives success in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; litigation and worship her for court cases. This is like going to a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; king to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ask for two spoons of sugar for your milk. You go to the king for \n&gt;&gt; &gt; bigger\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things and a neighbor is enough for giving you two spoons of sugar. The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enemies destroyed by Bagalamukhi are internal enemies and your own \n&gt;&gt; &gt; laziness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember, she is a mahavidya, i.e. a type of supreme knowledge that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; liberates you!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rahu is the spirit of material well-being within us. Rahu is the one \n&gt;&gt; &gt; who\n&gt;&gt; &gt; binds us to rebirth (this is why Saturn showing sins and Rahu showing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rebirth are important in the death chart). The highest form of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt;&gt; &gt; coming from delving deep into this aspect is what gives us worldly \n&gt;&gt; &gt; success\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in a dhaarmik way. If you master the knowledge that makes you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; materially\n&gt;&gt; &gt; successful in a dharmik way, you become successful and fulfil all your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; duties and debts in the world and eventually get liberation. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuvaneswari\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personifies this knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ketu is the spirit of of detachment and Vedic knowledge within us. The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; highest form of knowledge coming from delving deep into this aspect is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; essense of Veda. If you master the knowledge that enables you to be in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; oneness with the supreme cosmic being, you eventually get liberation. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kamala\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (Mahaalakshmi) personifies this knowledge. According to saptashati \n&gt;&gt; &gt; rahasya\n&gt;&gt; &gt; also, Mahaalakshmi is the Aadyaa (the first One). She is the energy of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; supreme cosmic being. She divides Herself into 3 parts - Mahaakaali,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mahaalakshmi and MahaaSaraswati and they create Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; their consorts. Kamala represents the knowledge of the supreme cosmic \n&gt;&gt; &gt; energy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the supreme cosmic being.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One of the above is not superior to the other. Depending on your \n&gt;&gt; &gt; vasanas\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (mental conditioning), attitudes, likes and dislikes, depending on \n&gt;&gt; &gt; which\n&gt;&gt; &gt; aspect of your personality dominates over other aspects (the sinfulness \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; weaknesses? or the interest in learning things? or the spirit of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; fighting?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or the sense of enjoyment? etc), one Mahavidya may be more suitable \n&gt;&gt; &gt; than\n&gt;&gt; &gt; others, as that knowledge uses your strong aspect and moulds that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; aspect to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; take you towards liberation. Do not compare them. Take the one that is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; most\n&gt;&gt; &gt; suitable, but do master that aspect.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There are some who do Dasa Mahavidya sadhana by doing one Mahavidya&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for one month, then switch to another and so on. They think that by \n&gt;&gt; &gt; doing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; each mahavidya mantra for a certain count, they &quot;finish&quot; the mahavidya\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana. This is wrong and serves no useful purpose. Instead, one \n&gt;&gt; &gt; should\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pick any ONE mahavidya and succeed in that sadhana. The definition of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; success is that the knowledge represented by that deity becomes part of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; common sense - you understand that knowledge and ooze that knowledge in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thoughts and actions. Whether you experience the deity as an external\n&gt;&gt; &gt; human-like form (who may impart some knowledge to you) or as an \n&gt;&gt; &gt; internal\n&gt;&gt; &gt; human-like form or as light or as sound is secondary, but the end \n&gt;&gt; &gt; result\n&gt;&gt; &gt; should be that the knowledge represented by Her should become common \n&gt;&gt; &gt; sense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and second nature to you. One claiming visions or siddhi of a mahavidya \n&gt;&gt; &gt; but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not showing the corresponding knowledge is bluffing.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There are many people who do mahavidya sadhana and yet many others who \n&gt;&gt; &gt; claim\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to have siddhi in one or more mahavidyas, but very few who actually \n&gt;&gt; &gt; possess\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any of the ten mahavidyas. The area of mahavidya sadhana is one of the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; most\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ill-understood in today&#39;s age of ignorance and half-baked knowledge. It \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; easier to possess lower vidyas or lower shaktis, but mahavidyas are \n&gt;&gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the capability of understanding for most people.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
