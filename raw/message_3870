That is the core of any=\r\n rituals. The Atma of any Saadhana.\nBut I feel necessary to mention few wor=\r\nds here so that what you have written is not misunderstood. As we all know =\r\nquite well that Mind does not want to engage in Spiritual Saadhana. Mind wi=\r\nll convince the own fraction and play all kinds of tricks to induce flexibi=\r\nlity in any saadhana and finally drag one completely away from any Spiritua=\r\nl Saadhana. Though it is a must to try and develop Bhava in any rituals, It=\r\n is also very important to keep doing things at whatever regularity possibl=\r\ne. *Flexibility* may prove a pitfall many a times.\n\nFollowing are delightfu=\r\nl reading for me.\n\n&gt; The progress here in some ways is measurable how ever =\r\nI must submit there is always a long way to go, it may take many lifetimes.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I have observed that as soon as one starts on this and becomes seriou=\r\ns\n&gt; more challenges seem to come his or her way :-) my experiance\n&gt; \n&gt; Some=\r\ntimes when you try to do good, you get a lot of bad in return, may be it is=\r\n all part of cleansing :-).\n\nBTW Akshay Tritiya is yet to come. i dont know=\r\n when. May be Manish or Narasimha may be knowing.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a very important question, I have asked this quest=\r\nion myself\n&gt; and searched for answers, while trying to do this, I found som=\r\nething interesting. I have asked others ( people I found capable of answeri=\r\nng) this questions and gotten interesting answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I found is, an=\r\ny type of sadhana homam, japan, reading chandi paath\n&gt; or any remedial meas=\r\nures are very important and one must do more and \n&gt; more as capacity and ca=\r\npability permits while always focusing on bhava, as bhava is the quality pa=\r\nrameter it is more important than even pronounciation or time of japam  i.e=\r\n 1 mala versus 10 mala for example. Always try to increase the bhava and no=\r\nt other physical parameters like doing japam for 2 hours versus 30 minutes =\r\nor doing homan daily versus weekly etc. Many times when we try to stick to =\r\na rigourous schedule like doing daily atleast I have felt that many of thos=\r\ne days the &quot;bhava&quot; is missing or mind is somewhere else.\n&gt; Each individual =\r\ncan select what is best for him or her, I donot suggest any one way.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe &quot;bhava&quot; is most important measure and that needs to be increased or impr=\r\noved all the time. I could be one of the measures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Almost most of the =\r\ntime while one starts or appears to feel that journey on the path of spritu=\r\nality is started, it is associated with increase in ego or other attributes=\r\n that may make one careless.\n&gt; Sometimes even getting a realized guru bring=\r\ns these distractions too.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is all play of maya or the chit vikara =\r\nor accumulated sanskars in the mind. This has to play out, I am not sure on=\r\ne should attempt to avoid it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming back to the question, what I have=\r\n found and has seen stressed very little everywhere these days is what I ca=\r\nll &quot; Vaivhara Suddhi&quot; or conduct\n&gt; in mind, physical form and other things.=\r\n Vaivhara Suddhi opens the doors for Chit Suddhi or cleansing of the mind.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing all sadhana helps indirectly to start on the journey of &quot;Vaivhar=\r\na Suddhi&quot;, But there is direct way too and one can practise it directly lik=\r\ne any sadhana on a  24 by 7 basis. It is also a sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; It is onl=\r\ny with Vaivhara Suddhi&quot; one can cleanse the mind or Chitta. It is needed in=\r\n the begining, middle and end, i.e. all times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once one cultivates, it=\r\n becomes a true nature of oneself and then it is always there but getting t=\r\nhere is very long journey.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are two aspects of chit suddhi, one i=\r\ns removing what is accumulated and stopping to accumulate more sanskars.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Vaivhara Suddhi helps in stopping to accumulate more and the other sadha=\r\nnas that one does helps in removing the accumated sanskars.\n&gt; \n&gt; So both go=\r\n hand in hand, doing one without other is no good,\n&gt; it just adds more accu=\r\nmulations in the chitta.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Along with doing sadhana, one needs to int=\r\negrate as many aspects of \n&gt; &quot;Vaivhara Suddhi&quot; like karma yoga, good behavo=\r\nir, not getting angry\n&gt; not screaming, forgiving, helping nature without an=\r\ny expectation, a disciplined life style, accept things as they are etc. Aga=\r\nin one can make a list of 10 limitations that one has, be genuine and hones=\r\nt to oneself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the above can be monitored and one can overcome =\r\nto a great extent by trying hard doing introspection of oneself.\n&gt; \n&gt; One c=\r\nan select the top 10 limitations in oneself and try to focus on them or to =\r\nstart with adopt 10 things and try to perfect them.\n&gt; \n&gt; One saint suggeset=\r\ned pledging everymorning and checking everynight\n&gt; add the pluses and minus=\r\nes and see how to avoid minuses.\n&gt; \n&gt; He also suggested in this journey one=\r\n will fall down many times but\n&gt; as soon as one falls down, one should get =\r\nup and try again to move forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; The progress here in some ways is me=\r\nasurable how ever I must submit there is always a long way to go, it may ta=\r\nke many lifetimes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have observed that as soon as one starts on this =\r\nand becomes serious\n&gt; more challenges seem to come his or her way :-) my ex=\r\nperiance\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes when you try to do good, you get a lot of bad in re=\r\nturn, may be it is all part of cleansing :-).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I just narated a few =\r\nobservations of mine, I am sure I did not answer your question here :-) ...=\r\n... Enjoy the day\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards on a wonderful day of Akasya Trutiya\n&gt; =\r\nPlease ignore any spelling deficiancies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I sincerely wi=\r\nsh to surrender to Mother completely.
