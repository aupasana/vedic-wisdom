I also managed to read some portions of the Agho=\r\nra series by Svoboda. While I have been doing the Ganapathi homam for the p=\r\nast few months as regularly as I can , I have always been very drawn to bha=\r\ngawati / Devi upasanas. I get very emotional whenever I hear a great song/ =\r\nname of the devi or see an endearing image of the mother. I have to stop my=\r\n tears with great effort in such situiations. This does not happen with any=\r\n other God  /deity .\n\n1) Does this mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to=\r\n me ? Or is it just my mind at working overtime. \n\nAfter reading the accoun=\r\nts there is an intense desire to perform the Chandi homam. But before that =\r\nI need to become comfortable with the Chandi recitation. That seems to be s=\r\nome time away considering that its an exhaustive script. While I continue t=\r\no work on this path, I wanted to do some kind of homam for the devi in the =\r\nmean time.\n\n2) Is it possible to recite only specific portions from the Cha=\r\nndi for the Chandi homam instead of going through the entore 700 verses?\n\n3=\r\n) Can I use some other mantras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra &quot;om ai=E0 =\r\nhr=E9=E0 kl=E9=E0 c=E4mu=EB=F2=E4yai vicce&quot; .\n\n4) Alternatively can I perfo=\r\nrm the homam using the Durga Suktam . Kindly let me know the procedure if I=\r\n am using just the Durga suktam for performing the homam.\n\nThanks and Regar=\r\nds with my humble pranaams,\nGirish Sundaram.\n\n\n"}}
