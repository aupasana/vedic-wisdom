Kundalini remaining i=\r\nn sahasraara forever is moksha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The four internal instruments (antahk=\r\naranas) are manas, buddhi, ahamkaara and chitta.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manas (sensory-motor=\r\n mind) lies in manomaya kosha (the mental sheath) and buddhi (intellectual/=\r\ndiscriminating mind) lies in the vijnaanamaya kosha (the knowledge sheath).=\r\n These two sheaths, along with the praanamaya kosha (the vitality sheath) f=\r\norm the so-called sookshma sareera (subtle body). Now, apart from the gross=\r\n physical body and subtle body, there is a causal body (kaarana sareera). T=\r\nhis contains the fifth sheath called aanandamaya kosha (the bliss sheath).\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; The antahkaranas that lie in this layer are chitta and ahamkaara. Chi=\r\ntta (conditioned/remembering mind) stores all previous observations of mana=\r\ns and judgments of buddhi and retrieves them when needed. What is stored to=\r\n/retrieved from chitta is based on I-ness or ahamkaara.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please note t=\r\nhat ahamkaara and chitta influence each other. While one&#39;s I-ness influence=\r\ns which experiences are added to the layer of conditioning in chitta, also =\r\nthe mental conditioning represented by chitta influences what entity one ca=\r\nn identify with. If there is too much heavy conditioning, one&#39;s ahamkaara c=\r\nannot rise above the five elements and one cannot identify with a deity for=\r\n example.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Normally ahamkaara or I-ness binds itself to an entity that=\r\n has several dense properties. If chitta becomes lighter and one can make a=\r\nhamkaara bind to something with lighter and lighter properties and if one f=\r\ninally succeeds in making ahamkaara not bind itself to anything, i.e. one h=\r\nas no I-ness, then one is established in Brahman without a sense of &quot;this i=\r\ns I&quot;, &quot;this is something else&quot; etc. This is nirvikalpa samadhi. However, at=\r\n that stage, the other properties of the previously individualized consciou=\r\nsness still remain, e.g. 5 jnaanendriyas, 5 karmendriyas, 5 praanas, manas,=\r\n buddhi and chitta. However, ahamkaara is not identifying with *anything*, =\r\nnot even with a manifested deity or some energy, and hence one is establish=\r\ned in Brahman.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some conditioning may still be left in chitta when one=\r\n&#39;s Kundalini reaches sahasraara. It may have been subtle enough to let aham=\r\nkaara become silent and not identify with any entity for a while. But it ma=\r\ny not be empty yet and suddenly it may spring into action and not let ahamk=\r\naara remain silent anymore. So some thought may be retrived from the condit=\r\nioned mind and that may provoke the silenced ahamkaara into returning to ac=\r\ntion. One may come out of samadhi and regain individualization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; DRAM =\r\n(dynamic random access memory) used in computers needs to be refreshed now =\r\nand then. Otherwise, data in it is erased. If the CPU is accessing DRAM now=\r\n and then and refreshing it, the data stays there. If CPU does not access t=\r\nhe data for too long, then the data is erased. Similarly, if one stays in n=\r\nirvikalpa samadhi long enough, all the conditioning in chitta is erased. Th=\r\nen one becomes free. If one stayed in nirvikalpa samadhi for a little time,=\r\n it makes chitta lighter but not empty.\n&gt;  \n&gt; To give a simple analogy, ima=\r\ngine ahamkaara to be the CPU of a computer. Imagine chitta to be the DRAM (=\r\nmemory). Imagine buddhi to be the ALU (arithmetic and logical unit) of the =\r\nCPU. Imagine manas to be the I/O (input/output) interface unit.

It seems to be his extr=\r\napolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upanish=\r\nad is the traditional view that I am familiar with. Other scriptures refer =\r\nto the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; , where Maharsh=\r\ni Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic unders=\r\ntanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The f=\r\nive chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent=\r\n ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, ear=\r\nth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are =\r\neffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, wat=\r\ner element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are =\r\neffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By ear=\r\nth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc=\r\n. Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a fle=\r\nxible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a =\r\nparticular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of so=\r\nlid state and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular =\r\nthing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of=\r\n water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to =\r\nthe five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one per=\r\nhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physically. =\r\nApart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has cer=\r\ntain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts o=\r\nne has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents=\r\n that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anyth=\r\ning* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is i=\r\ns still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anyth=\r\ning* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of w=\r\nho one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many peop=\r\nle who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talk=\r\ning merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may =\r\nstill be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually b=\r\neing there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive =\r\na solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as K=\r\nundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative =\r\nidea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existenc=\r\ne! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self =\r\n(&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towar=\r\nds samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes=\r\n down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, f=\r\nire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do=\r\nes physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to desc=\r\nribe/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the externa=\r\nl senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external se=\r\nnses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may =\r\nbe asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;h=\r\near&quot; a conversation between them. In another example, a yogi may be meditat=\r\ning with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; so=\r\nme things. These things cannot be perceived by the external senses and henc=\r\ne cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reaso=\r\nnable to define reality as something that can be perceived by the external =\r\nsenses, because different people can experience the same reality using thei=\r\nr senses individually and verify the observation. However, some experiences=\r\n of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very powerful=\r\n and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberating influence on peopl=\r\ne. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback of modern science.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize d=\r\nreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, bec=\r\nause there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy of a study.=\r\n But there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the following m=\r\nessages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of=\r\n mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, =\r\none person had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and=\r\n another person seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail re=\r\nlating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience =\r\nof the first person, though it was beyond the external senses of either per=\r\nson!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nn the above message also, one person had a specific yogic experience that w=\r\nas described in detail and another person seemed to know about it and suppl=\r\nied a couple of tangible details relating to the experience, suggesting tha=\r\nt he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyon=\r\nd the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal g=\r\nod and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above messa=\r\nge, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and anothe=\r\nr person perceived with his external senses a vision involving the same dei=\r\nty, though others in the room could not perceive anything with their extern=\r\nal senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of t=\r\nhe first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest=\r\n that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by th=\r\ne external senses are observable by others, though not everyone may be able=\r\n to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experience=\r\ns that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses being a part =\r\nof the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how ca=\r\nn modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing =\r\nthat can be studied and measured is the reality involving the gross body an=\r\nd its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be st=\r\nudied by observing various parts of the gross physical body. For example, o=\r\nne can look at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of the bra=\r\nin and try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it as=\r\nsumes that subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some =\r\ncorrespondence between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies,=\r\n it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case t=\r\nhe concept of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever th=\r\ney model can be moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses from the road,=\r\n you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house with a lo=\r\nt of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be having a party. P=\r\neople in one particular house with no lights are probably out of town. But =\r\nyou can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many people are in=\r\nside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from =\r\noutside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous sign=\r\nals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic thing=\r\ns, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach a=\r\nnd study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern scienc=\r\ne cannot study that part of the reality which is beyond the scope of extern=\r\nal senses, unless scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the intern=\r\nal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had master=\r\ny of the internal world (which is the microcosm of the entire universe) and=\r\n could observe any space-time point, even the greatest yogis of today canno=\r\nt control their state completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere=\r\n and one may experience some part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot c=\r\nontrol exactly where Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite =\r\nReality one observes. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri =\r\nTarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sor=\r\nry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the =\r\ndiaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest orde=\r\nr) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention in details about the proc=\r\ness of creation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at t=\r\nhe beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vid=\r\nhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced som=\r\ne universal energies which are more commonly known as the universal deities=\r\n like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these=\r\n are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence of the=\r\n element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interact=\r\nion with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way c=\r\name, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and each o=\r\nne resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore p=\r\nossible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson=\r\n in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it..

There being multiple theories of the String varie=\r\nty, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is=\r\n one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the phys=\r\nical world. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five ele=\r\nments, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some co=\r\nrrelation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpr=\r\netation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link =\r\nbetween M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well,=\r\n with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how=\r\n exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited understan=\r\nd fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since the=\r\n M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nother thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics=\r\n. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? The=\r\nse two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. I=\r\nt need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Fe=\r\nynman once famously quoted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works,=\r\n but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea o=\r\nf the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everything. The =\r\nday physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing more left to do. =\r\nPhysics is still quite far away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue,=\r\n 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get th=\r\ne thrust of your point.
