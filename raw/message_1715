Nature has created a \n&gt; sit=\r\nuation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has placed that \n&gt;=\r\n person in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; (=\r\n2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the \n&gt; opp=\r\nortunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in the \n=\r\n&gt; action while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;), he now gets a=\r\n \n&gt; new karma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are correct. From his =\r\nperspective, he is doing it with identification \n&gt; and he is incurring a ne=\r\nw karma. From your perspective, you are being paid \n&gt; back for what you did=\r\n before.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In order to break out of this cycle,=\r\n accept it when somebody does something \n&gt; to you. Do not hate the person o=\r\nr pity yourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it \n&gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think o=\r\nnly about your current action (&quot;what is the \n&gt; best thing for me to do NOW?=\r\n&quot;) and do NOT think about what happened, why it \n&gt; happened, who did it and=\r\n how things happening to you are unfair.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tricky thing is when Natu=\r\nre places you in a position to pay back \n&gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma and cr=\r\neates a strong temptation for you to do so. \n&gt; You may feel a sudden urge f=\r\nrom inside to do a bad thing to someone! But \n&gt; remember one thing. Any tho=\r\nught or action with a sense of doership (&quot;I am \n&gt; doing&quot;) will create a new=\r\n karma, even if the other person brought it on \n&gt; himself with a previous a=\r\nction.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and =\r\nsurrendering \n&gt; the action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma=\r\n. But that is \n&gt; very very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of cours=\r\ne, you can also \n&gt; postpone the payback through the use of your *will power=\r\n*, i.e. avoid the \n&gt; temptation and not do the bad thing to the other perso=\r\nn. As long as we live \n&gt; in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. B=\r\nut good discretion, \n&gt; self-control and strong will power will enable one t=\r\no postpone the most \n&gt; troublesome karmas to a later time.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the re=\r\nactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through who is \n&gt; not in =\r\nYOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So you \n&gt; ca=\r\nn do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large \n&gt;=\r\n extent under your control. Use your will power to do the right things.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From:=\r\n &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunda=\r\ny, April 26, 2009 2:19 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; is it that everything that is happening to us in this life is all react=\r\nion \n&gt; &gt; to some of our past actions?it is difficult for me to understand t=\r\nhis.\n&gt; &gt; To me, it can also be that someone is pushing this suffering onto =\r\nus as \n&gt; &gt; his action than a reaction of our old karmas.\n&gt; &gt; In any case, i=\r\nf we are getting cheated and we know it clearly why should \n&gt; &gt; we sit back=\r\n and just let things happen against us, why should we not fight \n&gt; &gt; back?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; KK\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasim=\r\nha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fantastic qu=\r\nestion! Before I answer it, I want to say that I am impressed \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with th=\r\ne decription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the =\r\ngreater Boston area too?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Karma and =\r\nkarmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; being=\r\n pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object w=\r\nith some force and that object pushes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you back karmically with the sa=\r\nme force at a later point of time, it is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; not necessary that you resis=\r\nt it and apply some more force to push again. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. =\r\nThat is action. You are being pushed now. That is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you t=\r\nake this push and whether you resist or not has \n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing to do with th=\r\ne old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; apply some force=\r\n NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of mental=\r\n equanimity and stability does \n&gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living person has a =\r\nlimited ego (I-ness) which binds \n&gt; &gt;&gt; him to a body and an identity (e.g. =\r\nPVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like \n&gt; &gt;&gt; this, who knows so and so things, w=\r\nho does so and so things, who wants so \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husb=\r\nand of Padmaja, who is the father of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is =\r\nthe sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the binding is completely re=\r\nmoved and one becomes completely unbound from \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I=\r\n-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So \n&gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being m=\r\nust have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this eg=\r\no (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-a=\r\nttached to another body and environment. Nature \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. J=\r\nust as post office delivers all mail addressed to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment =\r\nto your new apartment when you change address, Nature \n&gt; &gt;&gt; delivers the re=\r\nactions of all previous life actions to the sense of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in this l=\r\nife.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature=\r\n will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions f=\r\nrom that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award,=\r\n losing an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people, being hit b=\r\ny wife, being \n&gt; &gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being che=\r\nated by a friend \n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to previous action=\r\ns. As long as one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will c=\r\nontinue to deliver \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Osca=\r\nr award as a result of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessary that =\r\none should be happy or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not think that a reactio=\r\nn from Nature to one&#39;s good \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction=\r\n makes one happy. How one feels \n&gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated,=\r\n it is not necessary that one should \n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think =\r\nthat a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s bad \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if =\r\nthat reaction disappoints him. You cheated \n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arran=\r\nge such that that person cheats you now. How \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is=\r\n not relevant as far as the old action-reaction \n&gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned=\r\n. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does \n&gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature =\r\nfrom doing its job.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacti=\r\nng to what is happening now, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose yo=\r\nu cheated a person in a previous \n&gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for th=\r\nat person to cheat you now. His \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to =\r\nyour own action (but if he does it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with the =\r\naction, it becomes a new karma for that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; person. But, that is irreleva=\r\nnt to you). If you just face it calmly and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, yo=\r\nu finish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to =\r\nstop the person from cheating you. Then your current \n&gt; &gt;&gt; actions would be=\r\ncome a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you=\r\n want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; have to be=\r\nhave like the person you described below. Accept whatever comes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; your =\r\nway with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed \n&gt; &gt;&gt; m=\r\nind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subj=\r\nect: Karma\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn the=\r\nir karmas if they are able to be in a neutral \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind =\r\nand not be affected by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A clo=\r\nse family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yea=\r\nrs\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He v=\r\nery\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the hospital and took care of =\r\nall of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the family. His wife was a=\r\n very spiritual person\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident, his =\r\nwife told him of her \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation experience and that s=\r\nhe would probably be leaving her body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never shed a=\r\n tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even dur=\r\ning the funeral process.
