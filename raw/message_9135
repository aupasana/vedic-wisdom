Can you pls share ur experiences like what =\r\nchanges have come in you and \n&gt; all others who r doing chandi homam, pls al=\r\nso share ur experinces.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; First let me take it internally. I was pr=\r\noud of my achievements, scholarship and clarity of thinking, several years =\r\nback. I still am. But, when someone bluntly tells me that (very few dare/ca=\r\nre to!), it does not upset me but makes me think now.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I used to exp=\r\nerience attacks of anger, jealosy, greed, delusion and lust quite\n&gt; often. =\r\nI still do. But I am able to resist better now and can \n&gt; recover and move =\r\non quickly instead of suffering for a long time.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I used to readily =\r\nwrite about some mystical experiences (sometimes in third person, i.e. with=\r\nout specifically mentioning that it was *my* experience), but the motivatio=\r\nn was not only to inspire others to do sadhana but partly to &quot;impress&quot; othe=\r\nrs about my &quot;achievements&quot;. Now, I share something only if I genuinely feel=\r\n that the experience or the disclaimer I mention at the end may inspire or =\r\ncaution or otherwise benefit someone. Now I hardly do it on public forums a=\r\nnyway and do it with only a handful of people when an occasion comes.\n&gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; Now, let me take it externally. When my company closed a business unit m=\r\nany months back, I had to move from a group where I had some clout to a gro=\r\nup where I was new. Though things are the same financially, there is a big =\r\nchange in the influence. But I am more relaxed than before.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I was k=\r\nnown as a good scholar and teacher of Jyotish and &quot;chairman&quot; of a Jyotish o=\r\nrganization based on a parampara. I am alone now, and not even sure of basi=\r\nc calculations (e.g. ayanamsa, computation of certain divisional charts etc=\r\n) even after experimenting with more possibilities than ever. Though I have=\r\n not fully convinced myself what is correct, I have convinced myself that w=\r\nhatever is out there is incorrect/incomplete (however, I keep teaching and =\r\ngiving readings to some people who trust me, based on &quot;my best current unde=\r\nrstanding&quot;). I am more focused than ever in my Jyotish research, but do not=\r\n feel any undue pressure to solve the puzzles like before.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Probably=\r\n this is=A0not=A0what you wanted to hear.. ;-) In any case, different peopl=\r\ne may get different results based on their karmas, dasas, gochara etc.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Now, on a serious note, those who are frustrated that their sadhana i=\r\ns not producing results may do well to realize that Rome is not built in a =\r\nday. Vasanas that have been reinforced in our consciousness for many lives =\r\ncannot be overcome in a few years. Just keep doing sadhana..\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Aslo,\n=\r\n&gt;  what seems like a loss from one angle may seem from another angle like l=\r\niberation from some unneeded baggage. What seems like a gain from \n&gt; one an=\r\ngle may seem from another angle like an unneeded baggage that bogs one down=\r\n.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; As I keep insisting, please don&#39;t idolize me or anyone associated=\r\n with homam movement. The whole idea behind homam is that Agni is the origi=\r\nnal preceptor of rishis and can ably guide anyone who surrenders to Him. Ig=\r\nnore personalities, surrender to Agni and walk your walk.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;___________________________=\r\n_____\n&gt; &gt;From: rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, March 17, 2013 9:34 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n experiences of Chandi homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Dear Narsimha ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;N=\r\navratris are about to come next month.About 6 years have passed since u sta=\r\nrted doing Chandi homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can you pls share ur experiences like what =\r\nchanges have come in you and all others who r doing chandi homam, pls also =\r\nshare ur experinces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This will be great guidence for others also.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;regards\n&gt; &gt;Rakesh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
