So essentially I am i=\r\nnterpreting the verse in the following manner after all this discussion. \n\n=\r\n1. Better to do Chandi Path and Homa (or any other sadhana) than not doing =\r\nat all.\n\n2. If one is attracted to Chandi Path and/or Homa, instead of wait=\r\ning for initiation and not doing anything, it is better to get started and =\r\npractise the same until you get initiation on Someday in some life, which i=\r\ns bound to happen due to boundless affection of Ma anyway. \n\n3. After getti=\r\nng started and practising for any length of time, one should not get carrie=\r\nd away by the feeling of doer-ship and keep doing with a feeling of surrend=\r\ner, which I think is the hardest part. Even doing Ganapati homam regularly,=\r\n sometimes gives me a superiority feeling and holier-than-thou attitude, wh=\r\nen I quickly remember of Shri PVR Garu, to come back to my senses. \n\nBTW, I=\r\n came across a book on Bhagavadgita by Shri Vidyaprakashanandagiri in Telug=\r\nu. The book is called &quot;geeta makarandamu&quot;. In this wonderful book he not on=\r\nly gave meanings and interpretations of Geeta but he even gave specific way=\r\ns practising several deekshas with several slokas of Geeta and specific yan=\r\ntrams. Being a peethadhipati and excellent pravachana kartha, this great ma=\r\nn did not include any cautionary statements about initiation or Upadesha on=\r\n these practises. So, I am thinking of practising the same when the appropr=\r\niate time comes, assuming that initiation is not needed. If any seniors in =\r\nthis forum have gone through this book or have more knowledge on the same, =\r\nI will be happy if they share their knowledge/opinions on the same. \n\nRegar=\r\nds, \n\nNagraj \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;bac=\r\nktocosmicroots@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Nagraj ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am wonde=\r\nring why people are not discussing about my question &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no. 1 in mail to S=\r\nhri Satya Prakash Garu. Is something inherently &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong with question its=\r\nelf? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No sir. There is nothing wrong with the question itself. In f=\r\nact it is a very good question in view of the big picture.   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Whils=\r\nt the Devi is assuring us that She will fondly accept all acts of worship, =\r\nsacrificial offerings and homas whether they are done with appropriate know=\r\nledge or not, Her assurance need not be taken as *permission* to dispense w=\r\nith knowledge of the same. She is proclaiming just as Lord Krishna too proc=\r\nlaims in the B. Gita,&quot;Aham hi sarvayajnanam bhokta ca prabhur eva ca&quot; (9.24=\r\n) and &quot;Patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati...&quot; (9.28). \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Most of the verses in the Devi Mahatmyam have parallels in the B. Gita a=\r\nnd Upanishads. Studying the 9th chapter of the B. Gita will enable the sadh=\r\naka to comprehend the depth of this verse better. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Krishna furthe=\r\nr proclaims (9.30), &quot;Even if the most sinful person worships me with unwave=\r\nring devotion, he must be considered as righteous for he has made the right=\r\n resolve&quot;. So are we to understand that the sinful person straightaway atta=\r\nins the same state as the righteous? No, certainly not. The Lord Himself un=\r\nambigiously clarifies this in the very next verse wherein He says that such=\r\n a person &quot;BECOMES&quot; righteous and attains everlasting peace. Here the EFFEC=\r\nT of the RIGHT RESOLVE is declared and the devotees are assured that they w=\r\nill never perish.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Likewise the Devi too is assuring us that She will=\r\n fondly accept all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and homas whether=\r\n they are done with appropriate knowledge or not. Her devotees will never p=\r\nerish irrespective of whether they have the right knowledge of how to worsh=\r\nip Her or not. She will fondly accept the worship, offerings etc of both cl=\r\nasses of devotees. In accordance with Lord Krishna&#39;s affirmation, here too =\r\nthose who worship Her without appropriate knowledge of mantras, procedures =\r\netc, by their very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the knowledge o=\r\nf the same and thereby attain Her. This verse is also a reminder that one n=\r\need not stay away from worshipping Her because they have no knowledge or on=\r\nly limited knowledge of how to worship Her. Every sadhaka has to perform th=\r\ne worship to the best of his/her abilities sincerely and humbly after surre=\r\nndering to Her. Her grace will enable the rest to happen naturally be it th=\r\ne required knowledge or initiation or something else. In conclusion through=\r\n this verse, the Devi is encouraging all of us to worship Her irrespective =\r\nof our current level of knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; \n&gt; No=\r\nte: Please see the following link for an explanation of the same verse by a=\r\nnother practitioner. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://kamakhyamandir.org/vidya/scriptures/mothe=\r\nr-accepts-all-sincere-worship/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
