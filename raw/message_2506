In reality, a deity existing microcosmically &quot;inside&quot; you, a deity ex=\r\nisting microcosmically inside me, a deity existing microcosmically inside s=\r\nomeone else and a deity existing &quot;externally&quot; in the macrocosm (universe) i=\r\ns one and the same and there is absolutely no difference between all of the=\r\nm! That is essentially the Upanishadic understanding.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;In fact, when y=\r\nou say &quot;inside me&quot;, ask yourself : &quot;what is this I&quot;? Is it the physical bod=\r\ny? Is it the subtle body? Is it the causal body? When mind entertains the n=\r\notion that it is a physical body, it indeed becomes aware of a physical bod=\r\ny and looks at it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is a subtle=\r\n body, it indeed becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it as I. When min=\r\nd entertains the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed becomes aware o=\r\nf a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally overcomes all such not=\r\nions one after the other, it may look at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cos=\r\nmic being) as I. According to upanishadic understanding, there is nothing o=\r\nther than Brahman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions like &quot;inside m=\r\ne&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; are just expressions that describe false =\r\nnotions rather than reality. There is no real you, I and he, but there is o=\r\nnly a supreme cosmic being.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;When you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion that th=\r\nere is a certain entity called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Narasimh=\r\na Rao&quot; etc, these entities exist within your mind, for as long as your mind=\r\n=A0can keep those notions alive. When all such false notions are successful=\r\nly eliminated, only=A0supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to focus on=\r\n.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;When a conditioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific per=\r\nson called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot; in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied=\r\n with so many things that it cannot focus itself on god perfectly... Due to=\r\n its pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in =\r\na very limited way. This is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. S=\r\nun&#39;s image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be b=\r\nroken and dark colored. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may app=\r\near broken. Like that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a =\r\ndifferent extent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mi=\r\nnd focuses on internal god and he is limited&quot;.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;This is just a simple =\r\nway to put things.=A0In reality, the issue is not internal vs external. The=\r\n issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pr=\r\ne-occupation with other things comes down and its ability to focus on god g=\r\noes up, we say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is j=\r\nust a way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal=\r\n or external, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind =\r\ncan focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirt=\r\ny mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a c=\r\nleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really beco=\r\nme cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror=\r\n&quot; has become cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirr=\r\nor! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirro=\r\nr 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and\n the same!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;This manner=\r\n of speaking about internal vs external god and talking about strengthening=\r\n internal god is used to simplify things. Bottomline is that any visualizat=\r\nion of god by a mind is limited by the conditioning, abilities and impuriti=\r\nes of that mind. By allowing the mind to visualize god, to the best of its =\r\nability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Event=\r\nually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in t=\r\nhe infinite god. Then we say that internal god has become infinite. This is=\r\n just a manner of speaking.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I want to give a small practical example, that is somewhat r=\r\nelevant and illustrates some concepts.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Once=A0a couple of priests wit=\r\nh a high spiritual caliber were conducting a Rudraabhishekam. They were cha=\r\nnting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting =\r\nin a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra=\r\n, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships, he always con=\r\nsiders everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as=\r\n receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling=\r\n his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her. After a while, hi=\r\ns Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He lost the regular a=\r\nwareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that he was part of and =\r\nremained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he came back and the p=\r\nooja was finished, one of the priests described something unusual that he &quot;=\r\nsaw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned towards this person an=\r\nd was surprised by what he saw. He saw\n a tall=A018-handed form of Mahalaks=\r\nhmi standing in=A0the place of this person for a little while.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;As tha=\r\nt person meditated, his=A0senses turned inward and he was looking internall=\r\ny. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being in his=\r\n visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal and external=\r\n blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (it is=\r\n neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as=\r\n the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. However, the priest wh=\r\no happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified state and so =\r\nhe noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time=A0made him see a=\r\n specific=A0external form rather than an all-pervading form. But both the p=\r\nriest and the person perceived the same entity in two different ways. One w=\r\nas external and limited. The other was neither internal nor external (but o=\r\nbtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But, both are the sa=\r\nme. They appeared different to two minds because of the\n conditioning of th=\r\nose minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun may appear differ=\r\nent in two different mirrors!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;No amount of theorization will help one fully understand and=\r\n appreciate things like this. The most important thing is to do some sadhan=\r\na, such as homam or meditation, on a regular basis. No effort is wasted and=\r\n eventually gives results when there is critical mass. Whatever I say, what=\r\never masters have said before and whatever rishis taught in upanishads, can=\r\n be understood and appreciated through direct experience. THAT is the goal =\r\nof sadhana. Reading scriptures and mails like this is only a starting point=\r\n. One has to engage in some sadhana. Even people like Ramana Maharshi, Rama=\r\nkrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vivekananda etc did sadhana for many y=\r\nears, before they realized god...\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt;Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself:=A0http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself:=A0http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;Spirituality:=A0htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=A0h=\r\nttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows):=A0htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=A0http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- ---------=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;&gt;Namaste Narasimha=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;T=\r\nhere is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear th=\r\nat point. You mentioned:\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;The god in your homam fire is not an exter=\r\nnal god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are proj=\r\necting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing you=\r\nr ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. =\r\nThough there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation =\r\nwith so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind ca=\r\nn focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow =\r\nit. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;When w=\r\ne are doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity from wit=\r\nhin ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deities r=\r\neside(inside) ? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing=\r\n out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, univ=\r\nersal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, a=\r\nnd I am trying to invite him into the fire?\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;I remember a line from =\r\nVimalananda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body=\r\n=A0so that this deity (the one we projected)=A0may=A0lead us to the real de=\r\nity who exists outside in the universe.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Did I understand the proced=\r\nure correct? Kindly put down your thoughts on this.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;=A0R=\r\najarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;--- On=A0Thu, 10/9/09, Narasimha PVR Rao&lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;=A0w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;&gt;Namaste Krishna Kanth,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose god really came to your place=\r\n in a human form and asked you to give him some nice food. Will you allow s=\r\nomeone who cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *well*. A purified ser=\r\nvant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion and has no oth=\r\ner thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person may think variou=\r\ns things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-centeredness and=\r\n ego even in serving god.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The god in your homam fire is not an exter=\r\nnal god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, you are proj=\r\necting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing you=\r\nr ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here..=\r\n Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation=\r\n with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind c=\r\nan focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow=\r\n it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On practice, =\r\nthe divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows with time.=\r\n Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestation of god in=\r\nside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divin=\r\nity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for =\r\nunnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your=\r\n desires and other\n thoughts will vanish and you will be able to single-min=\r\ndedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions will help you in the journey=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in your hom=\r\nam fire are basically being received in your internal god. If he has enough=\r\n power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a=\r\n specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes him weaker a=\r\nnd who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, when you=\r\n are offering things in fire, you yourself may have some unnecessary desire=\r\ns which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil=\r\n and there is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra=\r\n slow down?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness and =\r\nbeing nice.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing be=\r\ntween people very closely connected to one karmically, like wife, children =\r\nand parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desir=\r\nes may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fa=\r\nshioned families). So there is no significant drawback to allowing them to =\r\nshare fire.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Bottomline:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If some people are so close to you th=\r\nat you want to allow their karmas and their desires to affect your spiritua=\r\nl progress and slow you down, then allow such people to offer in your homam=\r\n fire. Even if you do not allow specifically, some close people&#39;s karmas an=\r\nd desires may already be directly affecting your own karmas and desires and=\r\n hence slowing you down!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Usually, that would be immediate family, bu=\r\nt you know your situation better.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Namaste Shri =\r\nKrishna Kanth,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immed=\r\niate family.

Just wante=\r\nd to just double check with you.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; As an alternative, can th=\r\ney offer some flowers and some Sandal paste/Turmeric etc to the Idol that w=\r\ne place along with the Homam instead of offering anything in the fire? or d=\r\noes they (mother oly :) ) has to perform the ritual independently all by he=\r\nrself and do not offer anything while i perform my ritual.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Please clarify.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; KK\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 9/8/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) Namboodiris are (or atleast used to be) ade=\r\npts in fire worship. What this namboodiri did is the correct way.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and worship it. T=\r\nhen offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, depen=\r\nding on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger with practi=\r\nce). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it, some ka=\r\nrmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for burning. Th=\r\nis intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anywa=\r\ny intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of course, yo=\r\nu can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready and willin=\r\ng to face their consequences, but a person with a strong individualized ego=\r\n should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s=\r\n ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas and fac=\r\ne their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and =\r\nfruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it\n grow ve=\r\nry\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, unti=\r\nl you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yourself =\r\nfrom the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone t=\r\no start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it e=\r\ntc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire d=\r\noes such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who fo=\r\nllow this approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a stro=\r\nng identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for t=\r\nhem and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can.. Thus, allowing e=\r\nveryone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be ineffic=\r\nient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The best approach is=\r\n: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in i=\r\nt. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that =\r\nburns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is inde=\r\ned formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and=\r\n burn various vaasanas.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods fo=\r\nr beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usuall=\r\ny standard.. Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to or=\r\n what you are more attracted to.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said many times, the=\r\nse nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a partic=\r\nular body part has a higher significance than just touching a body part and=\r\n saying the letter.. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a spec=\r\nific sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifyin=\r\ng one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essen=\r\ntially a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) They should be shown in the video.

I am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when we =\r\nhad a namboothiri perform the homam he would light the homam fire himself.=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; My question is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam fi=\r\nre or do it myself ?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) during the anganyasa and karan=\r\nysa specifically the glaam beejam , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/=\r\nmudras , I used to touch the heart , then right and left breasts respective=\r\nly whereas in the video you have shown it to be heart , navel and below res=\r\npctively. Is the beejam , shakthih and kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet f=\r\nor each diety ?=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) There are 4 more avhana mudras f=\r\nor suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava, varado bhava, sarvAbhIshTaprado bhava.

When mind e=\r\nntertains the notion that it is a physical body, it indeed becomes aware of=\r\n a physical body and looks at it as I. When mind entertains the notion that=\r\n it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it=\r\n as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed =\r\nbecomes aware of a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally overcom=\r\nes all such notions one after the other, it may look at the supra-cosmic bo=\r\ndy (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to upanishadic understanding, the=\r\nre is nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions=\r\n like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; are just expressions that =\r\ndescribe false notions\n rather than reality.

Due to its pre-occupations=\r\n, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. =\r\nThis is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be re=\r\nflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark color=\r\ned. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like tha=\r\nt, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a different extent. We=\r\n express this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mind focuses on intern=\r\nal god and he is limited&quot;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; s=\r\nize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;This is just a simple way to put things.&lt;SPAN class=3D=\r\nApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22e=\r\nm&quot; size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;In reality, the issue is not internal vs external.=\r\n The issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;=\r\ns pre-occupation with other things comes down and its ability to focus on g=\r\nod goes up, we say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this =\r\nis just a way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him inte=\r\nrnal or external, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But m=\r\nind can focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a =\r\ndirty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show=\r\n a cleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really =\r\nbecome cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mi=\r\nrror&quot; has\n become cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot;=\r\n mirror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in =\r\nmirror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and the same!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; size=\r\n=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;This manner of spea=\r\nking about internal vs external god and talking about strengthening interna=\r\nl god is used to simplify things. Bottomline is that any visualization of g=\r\nod by a mind is limited by the conditioning, abilities and impurities of th=\r\nat mind. By allowing the mind to visualize god, to the best of its ability,=\r\n on a regular basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, m=\r\nind loses all other pre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in the infin=\r\nite god. Then we say that internal god has become infinite.

They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worship=\r\ns Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate =\r\nwith Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity=\r\n he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalaksh=\r\nmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visuali=\r\nzing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantr=\r\na to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modi=\r\nfied. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading lig=\r\nht that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. =\r\nWhen he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described =\r\nsomething unusual\n that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that priest t=\r\nurned towards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw a tall&n=\r\nbsp;18-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in&nbsp;the place of this person=\r\n for a little while.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGH=\r\nT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1=\r\n.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2&gt;As that person meditated, his&nbsp;senses turned =\r\ninward and he was looking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi,=\r\n who filled his entire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his d=\r\nistinction of internal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *a =\r\npart* of all-pervading light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He =\r\nbasically perceived Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was als=\r\no a part of. However, the priest who happened to look at him at that time w=\r\nas also in a purified state and so he noticed something. His mental conditi=\r\noning at that time&nbsp;made him see a specific&nbsp;external form rather t=\r\nhan an all-pervading form. But both the priest and the person perceived the=\r\n same entity in two different ways. One was external and limited. The other=\r\n was neither internal nor external (but obtained\n by looking internally at =\r\nfirst) and unlimited. But, both are the same. They appeared different to tw=\r\no minds because of the conditioning of those minds rather than anything els=\r\ne, just as the same Sun may appear different in two different mirrors!&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIG=\r\nHT: 1.22em&quot; face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LIN=\r\nE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2=\r\n&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.=\r\n22em&quot; size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot; face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIG=\r\nHT: 1.22em&quot; size=3D2&gt;No amount of theorization will help one fully understa=\r\nnd and appreciate things like this.

Needless to say, the\n last=\r\n rites are considered very important ritual and is a privilege of the child=\r\nren, however, in this case since there was a karmic connection, the foreign=\r\n student (whom the gentleman also considered as one of his spiritual childr=\r\nen) ended up performing the ritual.&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converte=\r\nd-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; Regards&lt;BR styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; Narayan&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT:=\r\n 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; --- In&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em; COLOR: rgb(30,102,174)&quot; href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.m=\r\nail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, krishna Kanth &lt;kri=\r\ntels@... &gt; wrote:&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN\n class=\r\n=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Sri Narasimha garu &amp; Narayan garu,&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22=\r\nem&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;=\r\nLINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaskaram.&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LIN=\r\nE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or =\r\nmaking offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at=\r\n worst&quot;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-conve=\r\nrted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; I was l=\r\nittle taken aback by this statement of your&#39;s, because when is sit to do Ho=\r\nmam, my mother and my 2 yr old son would join me (90% of the times) and i h=\r\nave encouraged them to offer some sesame seeds along with me in the Homam w=\r\nhile i read the Atharvaseersham.&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN\n class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT:=\r\n 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; I was always under the thought process that, i&#39;m doing H=\r\nomam and they are sitting with me and doing some seva to god along with me.=\r\n But after reading your e-mail i&#39;m in doubt whether should i ask them to st=\r\nop offering in the fire?&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-spac=\r\ne&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; It is clear from=\r\n your earlier e-mail about the answer, but somehow i&#39;m not very comfortable=\r\n with that statement as my thought process is still like, God has come to m=\r\ny place and everyone of us are serving him (as you have put that like in ca=\r\nse of an Idol).

What this namboodiri did i=\r\ns the correct way.&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D=\r\nApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and worship it. Then =\r\nofferings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, depending=\r\n on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger with practice).=\r\n If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas=\r\n will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for burning. This i=\r\nntermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway in=\r\ntertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of course, you ca=\r\nn also take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready and willing to=\r\n face their consequences, but a\n person with a strong individualized ego sh=\r\nould limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s eg=\r\no becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas and face t=\r\nheir consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fru=\r\nits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very&lt;B=\r\nR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; big, it can give flowers and frui=\r\nts to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working to bur=\r\nn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) cau=\r\nsed by them.&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-=\r\nconverted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone t=\r\no start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it e=\r\ntc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire d=\r\noes such things, it can be\n disastrous. However, luckily, most people who f=\r\nollow this approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a str=\r\nong identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for =\r\nthem and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can.. Thus, allowing =\r\neveryone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be ineffi=\r\ncient at best and disastrous at worst.&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR style=3D&quot;LINE-HE=\r\nIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only=\r\n you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it wi=\r\nth your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If yo=\r\nu do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowled=\r\nge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.&lt;BR styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-converted-space&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR\n style=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 1.22em&quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are differe=\r\nnt methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaa=\r\nsa are usually standard..
