The highlighting is done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pash=\r\nu-nari he should have used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He did n=\r\not. At the level of text, it is indefensible. Also, if I go by your explana=\r\ntion, why only Naari who are pashu, why not Naras who are like pashus? Ther=\r\ne are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the world.=C2=A0This expla=\r\nnation=C2=A0 that you found looks more like a back engineering job to bail =\r\nout.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nRegarding Rama self realization, I think I was unable to=\r\n express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really=\r\n saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees t=\r\nhat Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C2=\r\n=A0God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended =\r\nin order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A p=\r\nath that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C2=A0 Co=\r\nmpare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was not =\r\nnamed &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path. \n=C2=A0\nWhenever,=\r\n according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind wil=\r\nl create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper and the worshipped and=\r\n thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama did. BUt if we try to loo=\r\nk at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc,=\r\n we have a better chance of following such a life.\nAn ordinary man cannot l=\r\nead the life of a God but he can follow the life of a great man.\n=C2=A0\nSim=\r\nilarly, even today lot of people advise that one should try to become like =\r\nVivekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in=\r\n teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C2=A0saint=\r\n of highest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C2=A0one who=C2=A0lived l=\r\nike a lion among sheep of ordinary=C2=A0men, fearless and uncompromising an=\r\nd principled. If every=C2=A0person would constantly think that Vivekanada w=\r\nas a saint=C2=A0who worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme sp=\r\nirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C2=A0no one will ever make an a=\r\nttempt to be inspired by him or=C2=A0emulate his way of living.Vivekanada w=\r\nas a spiritual giant, but=C2=A0the image he projected was one of a tireless=\r\n, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0On the other h=\r\nand=C2=A0you will never hear anyone advising that one should try to lead a =\r\nlife like Ramarkishna.=C2=A0=C2=A0That is impossible. He=C2=A0 was God inca=\r\nrnate leading a charmed life.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nSimilar is the case with the Ava=\r\ntar called Sri=C2=A0Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna. One can become=\r\n Rama in actions but one can never=C2=A0become Krishna. Therefore, my frien=\r\nd believes, one should not consider Rama as a God to be worshipped, but as =\r\na model to be followed.

It is understandable if he says Ra=\r\nma is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a great person claims Rama=\r\n is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of God which =\r\ndifferentiates Rama from Krishna?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some months back I had a very length=\r\ny, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or=\r\n not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theological debates - nothing to=\r\n do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I was g=\r\netting agitated and it would have affected our friendship. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that what=\r\n he can support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spiritu=\r\nality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate scriptures using exact=\r\n quotations etc, (theology)=C3=82=C2=A0but not about mysticism or sadhana o=\r\nr anything which=C3=82=C2=A0needs a belief system. That is why most people =\r\nknow him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0human being.=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0They have no clue about his=\r\n meditations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and genera=\r\nlly would not discuss God in public.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Therefore our discuss=\r\nion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved theologicall=\r\ny=C3=82=C2=A0- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C3=82=C2=A0 2) Is i=\r\nt wrong if people consider him as God=C3=82=C2=A0.. 3) The merits of the Ra=\r\nmcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 1) To the first question, he=\r\n believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 2) To the second question h=\r\ne says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is right or wrong=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0- but his personal opinion is that one should try to follow the=\r\n way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Ra=\r\nma had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and hi=\r\ns whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he was=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama di=\r\nd not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human=\r\n way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas tha=\r\nn to worship Rama.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, fr=\r\nom a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awad=\r\nhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has =\r\nbeen flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which=\r\n equates women with animals or something similar. He believes that was intr=\r\noduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust=\r\n. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further,=\r\n he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his A=\r\nvatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krish=\r\nna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on=\r\n this plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he =\r\nthinks.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to di=\r\nsagree. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; One r=\r\nequest, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be =\r\ngreat.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, bee=\r\nn busy myself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respo=\r\nnd. Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything from=\r\n a purely spiritual angle. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; It was only by chance that I f=\r\nound out one day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed them when =\r\nasked.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from =\r\na scientific point of view - about why there is no harm in having regulated=\r\n amounts of meat (not red meat). \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; But I say, as Narasimha =\r\nsaid, this person should not be taken as an ideal regarding food=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 habits.

I met him abo=\r\nut two years back. What first attracted me to=C3=82=C2=A0 towards him was h=\r\nis impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C3=82=C2=A0when it comes to=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0honestly.=C3=82=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head a=\r\nnd ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C3=82=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in=\r\n the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! H=\r\ne has actually never ever=C3=82=C2=A0spoken even a single lie in his whole =\r\nlife, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him th=\r\nat Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his teacher. Later=\r\n someone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the world=\r\n cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself two =\r\nthick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every day =\r\nhe spend one hour reading the\n English dictionary and\n&gt; one hour reading th=\r\ne Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=82=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and En=\r\nglish literature.=C3=82=C2=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is becau=\r\nse he wanted to be=C3=82=C2=A0equally adept at both the languages so that o=\r\nne day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromisin=\r\ng attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By educat=\r\nion, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from ba=\r\nnking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in most places. =\r\nHe speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Ara=\r\nbic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all t=\r\nhe above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself an atheis=\r\nt. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for religion as b=\r\nlank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that blank spac=\r\ne,\n he asked\n&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hin=\r\ndu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up=\r\n right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu i=\r\nn the form would have been a lie. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; So this gives a basic i=\r\ndea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls =\r\nhim Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; One day, long back, he was going to =\r\noffice for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna templ=\r\ne. As he was passing by in=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a stran=\r\nge urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went i=\r\nnside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next wh=\r\nen he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of =\r\nhow the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went i=\r\nnto the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time withou=\r\nt any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my frien=\r\nd had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in dee=\r\np sleep.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was th=\r\nere=C3=82=C2=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much abo=\r\nut these, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. Bu=\r\nt once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat,=\r\n in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0 Only his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believ=\r\ne nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Sa=\r\nmadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it f=\r\neels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, th=\r\ne stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the wate=\r\nr, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything.

The highlighting is done by you, not =\r\nin the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have used some basic gr=\r\nammer to remove confusion. He did not. At the level of text, it is indefens=\r\nible. Also, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari who are pashu, why =\r\nnot Naras who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of Pashu nature than N=\r\naaris in the world.&nbsp;This explanation&nbsp; that you found looks more l=\r\nike a back engineering job to bail out.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Regarding Rama self realization, I think I was unable to expres=\r\ns the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really saying=\r\n that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees that Sri=\r\n Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)&nbsp;God di=\r\nd not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended in order =\r\nto lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A path that =\r\nan ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.&nbsp; Compare thi=\r\ns to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was not named &quot;Kr=\r\nishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcs=\r\nious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper and the w=\r\norshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama did. BUt if =\r\nwe try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man, a devoted=\r\n husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a life.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nAn ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the life of=\r\n a great man.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Similarly, even today lot of peo=\r\nple advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda, or that this cou=\r\nntry needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean=\r\n Vivekanada was not a self realized&nbsp;saint of highest calibre, but his =\r\nlife&#39;s image is like&nbsp;one who&nbsp;lived like a lion among sheep of ord=\r\ninary&nbsp;men, fearless and uncompromising and principled. If every&nbsp;p=\r\nerson would constantly think that Vivekanada was a saint&nbsp;who worked by=\r\n the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of=\r\n a great guru,&nbsp;no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him =\r\nor&nbsp;emulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but&nbs=\r\np;the image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT ca=\r\nn inspire people. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;On the other hand&nbs=\r\np;you will never hear anyone advising that one should try to lead a life li=\r\nke Ramarkishna.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is impossible. He&nbsp; was God incarnate l=\r\neading a charmed life.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Similar is the ca=\r\nse with the Avatar called Sri&nbsp;Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna.=\r\n One can become Rama in actions but one can never&nbsp;become Krishna. Ther=\r\nefore, my friend believes, one should not consider Rama as a God to be wors=\r\nhipped, but as a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hope I have put forth&nbsp;his idea clear.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV cl=\r\nass=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-F=\r\nAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=\r\n=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva=\r\n Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 15/1=\r\n2/09, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: vedic_p=\r\nathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs=\r\n.

It is understandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but ha=\r\nrd to believe that such a great person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to a=\r\nsk him what really is the definition of God which differentiates Rama from =\r\nKrishna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose an=\r\nd charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind yo=\r\nu, these are all theoritical/ theological debates - nothing to do with actu=\r\nal spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I was getting agitat=\r\ned and it would have affected our friendship. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that what =\r\nhe can support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spiritua=\r\nlity with anyone per se. He will\n discuss and debate scriptures using exact=\r\n quotations etc, (theology)=C3=82&nbsp;but not about mysticism or sadhana o=\r\nr anything which=C3=82&nbsp;needs a belief system. That is why most people =\r\nknow him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;human being.=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;They have no clue about his=\r\n meditations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and genera=\r\nlly would not discuss God in public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore=\r\n our discussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved =\r\ntheologically=C3=82&nbsp;- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp; 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C3=82&nbsp;.. 3) The meri=\r\nts of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) T=\r\no the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debated from a spir=\r\nitual point if it is right or wrong=C3=82&nbsp;- but his personal opinion\n =\r\nis that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather t=\r\nhan worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. H=\r\ne could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, righ=\r\nt from the place where he was=C3=82&nbsp;located when he first heard the ne=\r\nws of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard w=\r\nay of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more im=\r\nportant to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodge=\r\npodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s=\r\n paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a critics =\r\nnightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with animals =\r\nor something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text because T=\r\nulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up\n co=\r\nmposing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama=\r\n is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri R=\r\nama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipp=\r\ned because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be=\r\n more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food ha=\r\nbits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have been out of touch=\r\n with him since August, been busy myself.

He is married, lives in Delhi and ha=\r\ns a son as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before I tell you anything mo=\r\nre=C3=82&nbsp;about his spiritual life=C3=82&nbsp;that I know, let me say=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him =\r\nabout two years back. What first attracted me to=C3=82&nbsp; towards him wa=\r\ns his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C3=82&nbsp;when it comes =\r\nto=C3=82&nbsp;honestly.=C3=82&nbsp;If someone were to put a gun to his head=\r\n and ask him\n to just say a simple, harmless=C3=82&nbsp;lie, like sun rises=\r\n in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too=\r\n! He has actually never ever=C3=82&nbsp;spoken even a single lie in his who=\r\nle life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him=\r\n that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his teacher. La=\r\nter someone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the wo=\r\nrld cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself t=\r\nwo thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every d=\r\nay he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one hour re=\r\nading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=82&nbsp;up volumes of Hind=\r\ni and English literature.=C3=82&nbsp;When I asked him why, he just said it =\r\nis because he wanted to be=C3=82&nbsp;equally adept at both the languages s=\r\no that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;which is more\n comprehensive language! As I said, he has an unc=\r\nompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything.=\r\n By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different field=\r\ns, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in mos=\r\nt places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, San=\r\nskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetr=\r\ny in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself=\r\n an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for rel=\r\nigion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that =\r\nblank space, he asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the c=\r\nlerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk=\r\n and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and =\r\nwriting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; So this gives a\n basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friend=\r\ns, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His=\r\n way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He s=\r\nays he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That =\r\nwas at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in =\r\nthe evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked th=\r\ne priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just st=\r\nayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow =\r\nfelt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He=\r\n remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=82&nbsp;that he =\r\ngot visions etc of Krishna.\n He does not say much about these, infact most =\r\npeople who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samad=\r\nhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same pla=\r\nce and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82&nbsp; Only his wife and=\r\n close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he =\r\nsits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone aske=\r\nd him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole uni=\r\nverse orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, th=\r\ne animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller th=\r\nan the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=82&nbsp;Lord Rama to =\r\nbe the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because =\r\nhe thinks it elevated Sri=C3=82&nbsp;Rama to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; level of a God whe=\r\nreas the aim of the orginal Valmiki\n Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an id=\r\neal man,=C3=82&nbsp;not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man =\r\nis someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to becom=\r\ne like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot =\r\nbecome Krishna, but one=C3=82&nbsp;can try to lead his life like Rama. I ha=\r\nve argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he doe=\r\ns not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust =\r\nmost Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later he had once=C3=82&nbsp;mentioned he knew the=\r\n relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His moth=\r\ner he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot=\r\n of time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;with those in=C3=82&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, discussing any=\r\nthing and everything with them, from Indian politics\n to Indian history, re=\r\nligion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who =\r\nwill be the future of this country.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He is am o=\r\nmnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had no=\r\nt asked his permission before mentioning him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n-Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS: I would=\r\n not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.
