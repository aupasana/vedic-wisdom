They have done a bunch of research\n&gt; comparing and contras=\r\nting the Tolkappiyam & Paniniyam grammar. I do\n&gt; not know anything about th=\r\nis, but it is certainly an interesting area\n&gt; of study.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dedicated to=\r\n the Adi sha~gkara ... with is comment on vyAkarNa\n&gt; &gt; his &quot;ai giri...&quot; can=\r\nnot be understand if you don&#39;t know what &quot;ai&quot; is\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly, on this tang=\r\nent -- to be best of my knowledge, the\n&gt; mahishAsura-mardini stotram is not=\r\n a composition of Adi shankara. I do\n&gt; not see it in the Vani Vilas edition=\r\n of his woks. It is possible that\n&gt; the composer was someone named Ramakris=\r\nhna Kavi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, on point. In my opinion, Adi shankara made no comm=\r\nent\n&gt; towards you, or towards any vaiyAkaraNa regarding vyAkaraNa. A little=\r\n\n&gt; bit of logic shows a lot of myth surrounding his moha-mudgara-stotra\n&gt; (=\r\nlater rebranded as bhaja-govinda). The rumour-mill account, which is\n&gt; take=\r\nn as the absolute truth says that Adi shankara saw an old man\n&gt; trying to s=\r\ntart learning grammar by memorizing the dhAtu-pAtha, and\n&gt; out of pity, he =\r\ninstructed him by spontaneously composing 12 verses.\n&gt; The remaining verses=\r\n are said to be later additions.\n&gt; \n&gt; (a) It is difficult to justify the co=\r\nmposition of the 2nd verse\n&gt; (muuDha jahiihi) and especially difficult to j=\r\nustify the composition\n&gt; of the 3rd verse (nArii-stana) as an upadesha to a=\r\nn old man. If we\n&gt; assume that aspects of the traditional account are true,=\r\n it is much\n&gt; more likely that he recited these verses to his own sannyAsii=\r\n students\n&gt; to cultivate vairAgya in them. Assuming that you are a non-sann=\r\nyAsii,\n&gt; there&#39;s no reason to get riled up about advice that is not primari=\r\nly\n&gt; directed at you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (b) Adi shankara is said to have composed the fi=\r\nrst 12 stanzas,\n&gt; following which, many of his students composed single ver=\r\nses that have\n&gt; been now been compiled together. It is pretty unlikely that=\r\n Adi\n&gt; shankara would have had his disciples (young and old) gang up on an\n=\r\n&gt; old man. It also seems unlikely that his students would have added\n&gt; onto=\r\n a work that was composed for someone else&#39;s benefit. In a\n&gt; satsanga of ri=\r\nshis, everyone waits for the main rishi to speak. On the\n&gt; other hand, assu=\r\nme that this advice was composed and imparted to his\n&gt; own students. It is =\r\nmore likely that his students might add onto this\n&gt; kind of work. Again, th=\r\nere is no reason for you to get riled up about\n&gt; advice that is not primari=\r\nly directed at you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (c) In the best case, the first verse (bhaja govin=\r\ndam) merely provides\n&gt; the context. At worst, it is a later addition. The m=\r\noha-mudgara\n&gt; consists of verses 1-12. Let us take the first verse as a\n&gt; m=\r\nangala-shloka, rather than excluding it altogether. This stotram is a\n&gt; wor=\r\nk of contemplation. Though Adi shankara is a master bhakta, this\n&gt; work is =\r\nnot a good example of bhakti. The older name of the stotram\n&gt; (moha mudgara=\r\n =3D hammering delusion), is much more reflective of the\n&gt; work that the po=\r\npular name (bhaja govindam). Across his works, Adi\n&gt; shankara is clear abou=\r\nt people needing different solutions at\n&gt; different points in their spiritu=\r\nal life. First, they need karma +\n&gt; upAsana, and only later should they pur=\r\nsue viveka. Thus, the advice in\n&gt; his stotra is intended primarily for a di=\r\nfferent crowd. It is unlikely\n&gt; that he would have given this advice to som=\r\ne random stranger. There is\n&gt; no reason for you to get riled up about advic=\r\ne that is not primarily\n&gt; directed at you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (d) Now, let us assume that=\r\n the rumour-mill account is true. As you\n&gt; have noted, Adi shankara&#39;s compo=\r\nsitions are composed in sanskrit.\n&gt; Further, it is clear that he is extreme=\r\nly well-versed in grammar. So,\n&gt; any conclusion that he is anti-grammar see=\r\nms strange, and is wrong.\n&gt; There is no reason to get riled up over this.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; (e) His sampradAya safeguards grammar. Just as one example, vyAkaraNa\n&gt;=\r\n is a regular topic of discourse in the yearly vAkyArtha-sabhA at\n&gt; sringer=\r\ni. It is the same institution that is publishing, and\n&gt; re-publishing vario=\r\nus grammatical works. His own disciples, who adorn\n&gt; this peeTha, are great=\r\n scholars of vyAkaraNa. Adi shankara, and his\n&gt; sampradAya are clearly not =\r\nanti-grammar. In fact, they are clearly\n&gt; pro-grammar. So, there is nothing=\r\n to get riled up about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, let us take the &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; verse at=\r\n face value. I still\n&gt; don&#39;t see the problem --\n&gt; \n&gt; That there is no point=\r\n in studying the dhAtu-pATha on the death-bed.\n&gt; This makes sense. &quot;dvAdash=\r\na-varShaiH shruuyate vyAkaraNam&quot;. Grammar is\n&gt; learned in 12 years. What po=\r\nint is there in starting the study on the\n&gt; death-bed? This doesn&#39;t mean th=\r\nat vyAkaraNam shouldn&#39;t be studied at\n&gt; all. All it means is that desha-kAl=\r\na-pAtra should be taken into\n&gt; account. And, if you want to take things lit=\r\nerally, Adi shankara said\n&gt; nothing about grammar in general. In this verse=\r\n, all he talked about\n&gt; was the dhAtu-pATha in particular.\n&gt; \n&gt; People who =\r\ntruly study the dhAtu pATha these days are rare, and I\n&gt; would expect a dis=\r\nproportionate number of them to consider Adi\n&gt; shankara as their guru.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 =A0ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
