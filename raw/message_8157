then my Maa once =\r\ntold me...&quot;apart from the deity who presides the temple don&#39;t you see inclu=\r\nding us how many kinds of people come here for invoking the Lord...for pray=\r\ning to him...many of them may include siddhas,yoginis,mahatmans whose ident=\r\nities are hidden from us...it is not possible in home to create space for a=\r\nll of them...but one of the prime significant purpose of the temple is also=\r\n for the congregation and assembly of such siddha men and women whose chant=\r\ns awakens the Garbha Griha and in whose sannidhya we are unknowingly blesse=\r\nd too...so it is not only a matter of whether the temple administrations is=\r\n running a temple well...but also that the lord remains there for the assem=\r\nbly of those many Bhaktas who come to visit&quot;...\n&gt; So this a viewpoint which=\r\n my Maa has told me keeping the temple darshan and archana at mind...and wh=\r\nat are its significance...keeping all the goods and patience that one may h=\r\nave to face while visiting a temple from a realistic viewpoint\n&gt; \n&gt; apart f=\r\nrom that it is perfectly ok to do archana in your home too as there is no p=\r\nlace where the Lord is not there...and ekanta seva and personal service of =\r\nthe Lord is the most important thing in sadhana...and it is in every way pu=\r\nrna(complete) if you are not visiting a temple and want to keep your practi=\r\nce and upasana to simple personal level.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (2)Now comes the point tha=\r\nt what is the significance of archana itself...it is i feel...sacrificing a=\r\nll the material senses at the altar of God...it is like an external symboli=\r\nsm of surrendering our inner senses the pancha or dasha indriyas...as whate=\r\nver we give to God for eg: in =A0pancha upacharas are pure gross consecrate=\r\nd matter which are used by the five senses of the Human body to take pleasu=\r\nre, to feel,and as a whole to survive...so externally surrending all the pu=\r\nrest or the sattvic forms of whatever is being used =A0by the five senses..=\r\n.we internally surrender ourselves...as through external practices with its=\r\n meaning well known comes internal awakening...and that what makes ritulas =\r\nor archana of a vigraha or symbol important.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; (3)The matter of offer=\r\ning names and gotras is done for whose concern you are doing archana...if i=\r\nt is a kamya karma...meaning if you are doing archana keeping in mind a wis=\r\nh to be fulfilled for yourself or anybody...then give the names and gotras =\r\nof all those for whose concern you are performing it and no need for any se=\r\nperate archana for all the persons...if not(that is nishkama) then simply g=\r\nive your name and gotra or just say that =A0perform archana for the Lord an=\r\nd surrender.\n&gt; Regular archana by simple pancha upacharas at home makes a p=\r\nerson disciplined and bestows him/her with a peaceful mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the re=\r\nspected elders please do pardon me if i have been wrong in my understanding=\r\n and Aravindji =A0if i have failed to answer your queries.anybody elses vie=\r\nw on the matter would enlighten me too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prantik\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
