For some this may sound like an empty question. Scie=\r\nnce has\n&gt; shaped our age; religion is a declining force in the West, as it =\r\nhas been\n&gt; for decades. A clock could be placed behind every pulpit, tickin=\r\ng off the\n&gt; thousands of people who leave organised faith behind, every hou=\r\nr of the\n&gt; day. But there is a growing movement that is repairing the rift =\r\nbetween\n&gt; science and religion. It has nothing to do with the noisy band of=\r\n atheists\n&gt; who continue to foment discord between faith and reason. Rather=\r\n, science\n&gt; has reached a point where certain basic mysteries cannot be sol=\r\nved without\n&gt; resorting to the one thing that spirituality&lt;http://timesofin=\r\ndia.indiatimes.com/topic/spirituality&gt; has\n&gt; always specialised in: conscio=\r\nusness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Science is dominated by materialism, a worldview that traces al=\r\nl activity,\n&gt; including our imagination and creativity, to physical process=\r\nes in the\n&gt; brain, and these processes are either chemically determined or =\r\nrandom,\n&gt; depending on which strain of materialism you confront. Spirituali=\r\nty, which\n&gt; is much broader than religion, is based on the assumption that =\r\na\n&gt; transcendent reality exists beyond the physical world. This is the doma=\r\nin\n&gt; of higher consciousness, or if you are conventionally minded, the home=\r\n of\n&gt; the soul and God.\n&gt;\n&gt; To find a common ground could be difficult but =\r\none can try. The annual\n&gt; Sages and Scientists Symposium organised by the C=\r\nhopra Foundation seeks to\n&gt; do just that by bringing together philosophers =\r\nand scientists who are\n&gt; sympathetic with the search for a single reality t=\r\nhat embraces science and\n&gt; wisdom. The worldwide financial meltdown is matc=\r\nhed by a cultural pandemic\n&gt; of confusion and a desperate search for deeper=\r\n values. A groundswell of\n&gt; knowledge and insight has been building. Its sh=\r\nared message is this: There\n&gt; is something else, a dimension of reality bey=\r\nond the material world. Beyond\n&gt; us, but in our midst.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scientists who a=\r\nre willing to venture into speculative thinking, joined by\n&gt; sages from the=\r\n world&#39;s wisdom traditions, who are willing to look beyond\n&gt; arguments abou=\r\nt God, face the same primal questions. Where did the\n&gt; universe &lt;http://tim=\r\nesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Universe&gt; come from?\n&gt; What preceded the Big=\r\n Bang&lt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Big-Bang&gt;,\n&gt; before there wa=\r\ns either &quot;where&quot; or &quot;when&quot;? A century after the quantum\n&gt; revolution in Phy=\r\nsics, science has to face up to the vanishing act that the\n&gt; physical unive=\r\nrse pulled, as matter and energy were both seen to emerge\n&gt; from a timeless=\r\n state that is either an empty void (which no one accepts)\n&gt; or a field of =\r\ninfinite possibilities, a veritable womb of creation (which\n&gt; almost everyo=\r\nne is beginning to accept, however offended science may be by\n&gt; learning th=\r\nat the world&#39;s ancient sages and spiritual teachers knew about\n&gt; this timel=\r\ness domain long before Physics arrived with its exact measuring\n&gt; devices).=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason that your future and mine depends on the settling of these\n=\r\n&gt; questions isn&#39;t what you might think. Science can proceed perfectly well =\r\nin\n&gt; everyday affairs without thinking about &quot;metaphysics,&quot; as materialists=\r\n like\n&gt; to call spirituality. For its part, spirituality can keep appealing=\r\n to\n&gt; individuals, one at a time as they arrive at personal crises, revelat=\r\nions,\n&gt; and awakenings. But what will be shortchanged is reality. Ultimatel=\r\ny,\n&gt; worldviews are secondary. If X believes in Buddha and Y in thermodynam=\r\nics,\n&gt; their two worlds can sit uneasily next to each other or simply not\n&gt;=\r\n interact. But reality is a shared concern. It&#39;s also a topic we can&#39;t\n&gt; af=\r\nford to leave to specialists. Where the cosmos came from means a great\n&gt; de=\r\nal, because the answer will tell you where the human mind came from, and\n&gt; =\r\nwhere it&#39;s going.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the universe conscious? If so, then our minds are =\r\nembedded in the\n&gt; cosmic mind. Is the universe evolving? If so, that casts =\r\nhuman evolution in\n&gt; a new light, along with the origin of life. These are =\r\nnot specialist\n&gt; questions. They go to the heart of the human condition.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Our intention is not to pigeonhole anyone as sage or scientist&lt;http://tim=\r\nesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/scientist&gt; or\n&gt; to join a camp &lt;http://times=\r\nofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/A-Camp&gt; for\n&gt; ideological reasons. There is a =\r\nstruggle going on between science and\n&gt; spirituality that will shape everyo=\r\nne&#39;s future, and if we each decide to\n&gt; join in, a blending may occur with =\r\nmagical consequences.
