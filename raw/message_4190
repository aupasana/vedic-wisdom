Some of them are meaningful to\n&gt; an extent and s=\r\nome of them are simply made up over the last few millennia by\n&gt; intellectua=\r\nls.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the pleasure o=\r\nf a\n&gt; deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are =\r\nsome traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam\n&gt; everyday =\r\nas a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these\n&gt; technical=\r\nities.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to=\r\n heavens (aakaasha)\n&gt; or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity=\r\n on earth. You cannot\n&gt; breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even=\r\n flow of signals in the\n&gt; nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere =\r\nat all times. Even during\n&gt; his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni i=\r\ns certainly capable of acting\n&gt; on earth, receiving our oblations here on e=\r\narth and making them reach\n&gt; various deities.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to =\r\nget your father (or mother) to buy you a car or to give you\n&gt; money to star=\r\nt a business, you may want to pick a good time to see him and\n&gt; talk about =\r\nit (e.g. when he is not tired after quarrel with someone and when\n&gt; he is i=\r\nn a good mood). Of course, even when you think you picked a good\n&gt; time, it=\r\n may be a bad time and your father may not be in a good mood.\n&gt; However, if=\r\n you do not have any such agendas and only want to tell your\n&gt; father &quot;I lo=\r\nve you&quot; and take whatever he gives, you can do it anytime. In\n&gt; fact, the l=\r\natter kind of child will be favored by parents over the long run\n&gt; and will=\r\n get whatever the parents have to give.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, if you want to get a=\r\n specific material result, there are several\n&gt; technicalities to bother abo=\r\nut. Even when you bother about them, you may not\n&gt; get it right. As I keep =\r\nemphasizing now and then, there are many corruptions\n&gt; in our understanding=\r\n of the technicalities and the art of getting specific\n&gt; material results t=\r\nhrough rituals is nearly extinct. The best approach is to\n&gt; surrender to yo=\r\nur deity, use homam or meditation to express your love and\n&gt; surrender and =\r\ntake whatever you are given in return as a prasad. Such a\n&gt; person will be =\r\nfavored by deities over the long run.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Ramakishore,\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Different points of space and different points of time have a different\n&gt;=\r\n quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana in Girnar\n&gt; =\r\nhills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same as\n&gt; sad=\r\nhana on Pournima.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (e.g.=\r\n a monthly Satya\n&gt; Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly Kr=\r\nishna homam), it is\n&gt; not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned wit=\r\nh the energy of that\n&gt; deity.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, one can only make so much progre=\r\nss with occasional sadhana. To\n&gt; make real progress and to experience divin=\r\nity, more intense sadhana is\n&gt; needed. If one is into serious sadhana with =\r\na mantra/deity, one can do it\n&gt; every day and at all times.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\n lot of beggars may be standing at the gate of a king&#39;s palace, waiting\n&gt; f=\r\nor the king to see them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some=\r\n\n&gt; money. That king may be known to step out of the house to go to a specif=\r\nic\n&gt; place on every so and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggar=\r\ns\n&gt; gathering at his gate on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that=\r\n day\n&gt; along with so many beggars, you may or may not be able to get someth=\r\ning from\n&gt; the king. On the other hand, if you simply stand at the gate eve=\r\nryday,\n&gt; king&#39;s eyes may fall on you someday!\n&gt;\n&gt; Have the attitude of a be=\r\nggar, surrender to the deity, keep doing your\n&gt; chosen sadhana everyday and=\r\n patiently wait for the deity&#39;s grace. That is a\n&gt; sureshot formula for suc=\r\ncess.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; The issue of auspicious days and times is a double edge=\r\nd sword. While a\n&gt; particular day may be more auspicious than other days, i=\r\nt may or may not\n&gt; mean much to one. For example, if a particular cricket p=\r\nitch is easier to\n&gt; bat on, you cannot expect to go there and score a centu=\r\nry. International\n&gt; cricketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir and Sehwag may sc=\r\nore more runs there\n&gt; than at other places, but you may still get out cheap=\r\nly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of helping, sadhana done on a particularly good day can som=\r\netimes\n&gt; bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I remember one incid=\r\nent.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wanted to spend=\r\n the\n&gt; coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for the whole day=\r\n. I got\n&gt; that intention from nowhere and did not look at anything like tit=\r\nhi, my\n&gt; horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Man=\r\nish and he\n&gt; said, &quot;excellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated with Gayatri mantra f=\r\nrom 5 am till\n&gt; 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks an=\r\nd having a\n&gt; fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. W=\r\nhen I finished\n&gt; in the night, I was in a nice state.\n&gt;\n&gt; Next morning, I r=\r\nealized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya\n&gt; (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya=\r\n, birthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day\n&gt; Tretayuga started). It is =\r\nsaid that spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya\n&gt; Tritiya is 1,000 times more e=\r\nffective than a normal day. I was excited that\n&gt; the day I picked at random=\r\n happened to be an auspicious day.\n&gt;\n&gt; I mentioned it to Manish. He said, &quot;=\r\nI knew it was Akshaya Tritiya even when\n&gt; you mentioned the intention to me=\r\n&quot;. I asked him why he did not tell that to\n&gt; me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;=\r\nknowing you were doing this sadhana on Akshaya\n&gt; Tritiya would not have hel=\r\nped and would have instead distracted you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He was right. As such, I wa=\r\ns a little &quot;proud&quot; of the sadhana - spending the\n&gt; whole day in japam. Ther=\r\ne was a bit of excitement and expectancy that was\n&gt; present as an undercurr=\r\nent and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra.\n&gt; Had I known that I wa=\r\ns doing it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be\n&gt; 1,000 times more effec=\r\ntive, that undercurrent of useless excitement would&#39;ve\n&gt; been higher and di=\r\nstracted me even more!\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But w=\r\nhat really matters is the\n&gt; state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana =\r\non an auspicious day can\n&gt; create excitement and expectancy and distract on=\r\ne. Doing the same sadhana\n&gt; everyday and patiently waiting for it to succee=\r\nd oneday is perhaps a simpler\n&gt; and more foolproof strategy.

Some of them are meaningful to an extent and some of them are si=\r\nmply made up over the last few millennia by intellectuals.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;However=\r\n, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the pleasure of a deity, one =\r\ncan and should ignore these technicalities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some tradition=\r\nal brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam everyday as a sadhana for=\r\n many generations and they do not look at these technicalities.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* =\r\n* *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to heavens (=\r\naakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on earth. Y=\r\nou cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow of signa=\r\nls in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all times. Ev=\r\nen during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainly\n capab=\r\nle of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and making the=\r\nm reach various deities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to get your father=\r\n (or mother) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you=\r\n may want to pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is=\r\n not tired after quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of co=\r\nurse, even when you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and =\r\nyour father may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such=\r\n agendas and only want to tell your father &quot;I love you&quot; and take =\r\nwhatever he gives, you can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child=\r\n will be favored by parents over the long run and will get whatever the par=\r\nents have to give.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Similarly, if you want to get a specific materi=\r\nal result, there are several technicalities to bother about. Even when you =\r\nbother about them, you may not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and\n=\r\n then, there are many corruptions in our understanding of the technicalitie=\r\ns and the art of getting specific material results through rituals is nearl=\r\ny extinct. The best approach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or me=\r\nditation to express your love and surrender and take whatever you are given=\r\n in return as a prasad. Such a person will be favored by deities over the l=\r\nong run.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Namaste Ramakishore,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Different points=\r\n of space and different points of time have a different quality to them. Sa=\r\ndhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana in Girnar hills or Arunachala hi=\r\nlls. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same as sadhana on Pournima.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;If one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (e.g. a monthly Satya Na=\r\nrayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly Krishna homam), it is n=\r\not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned with the energy of that de=\r\nity.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;However, one can only make so much progress with occasional\n =\r\nsadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, more intense sad=\r\nhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/deity, one can=\r\n do it every day and at all times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of beggars may=\r\n be standing at the gate of a king&#39;s palace, waiting for the king to se=\r\ne them when leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king=\r\n may be known to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every s=\r\no and so day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his ga=\r\nte on that day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many=\r\n beggars, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the=\r\n other hand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king&#39;s eyes may =\r\nfall on you someday!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Have the attitude of a beggar, surrender to t=\r\nhe deity, keep doing your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for th=\r\ne deity&#39;s grace. That is a sureshot formula for success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* *\n *&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;The issue of auspicious days and times is a double edged sword. Whil=\r\ne a particular day may be more auspicious than other days, it may or may no=\r\nt mean much to one. For example, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to=\r\n bat on, you cannot expect to go there and score a century. International c=\r\nricketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir and Sehwag may score more runs there t=\r\nhan at other places, but you may still get out cheaply.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Instead of=\r\n helping, sadhana done on a particularly good day can sometimes bog one dow=\r\nn with false pride and expectancy. I remember one incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few ye=\r\nars ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wanted to spend the coming Satur=\r\nday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for the whole day. I got that intent=\r\nion from nowhere and did not look at anything like tithi, my horoscope etc.=\r\n I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Manish and he said, &quot;=\r\nexcellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated with Gayatri mantra from 5 am till\n =\r\n9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks and having a fistf=\r\nul of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. When I finished in =\r\nthe night, I was in a nice state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next morning, I realized that the =\r\nprevious day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birthday of Ganga=\r\n and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said that spiritual s=\r\nadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective than a normal =\r\nday. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to be an auspic=\r\nious day.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I mentioned it to Manish. He said, &quot;I knew it was A=\r\nkshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me&quot;. I asked h=\r\nim why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;knowing y=\r\nou were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and wou=\r\nld have instead distracted you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He was right. As such, I was=\r\n a little &quot;proud&quot; of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japa=\r\nm. There was a bit of\n excitement and expectancy that was present as an und=\r\nercurrent and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that =\r\nI was doing it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more eff=\r\nective, that undercurrent of useless excitement would&#39;ve been higher an=\r\nd distracted me even more!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exi=\r\nst. But what really matters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a s=\r\nadhana on an auspicious day can create excitement and expectancy and distra=\r\nct one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to suc=\r\nceed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy.
