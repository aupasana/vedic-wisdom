The three wor=\r\nds that struck me in the mail were &quot;Abhichara&quot;, &quot;Vashikarna&quot; and &quot;Bali&quot; and=\r\n their importance in certain practices. Though i have yet to google the lat=\r\nter two terms to understand more about them, the following link gives an in=\r\nteresting write-up on &quot;Abhichara&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.google.co.in/search?hl=3Den&=\r\nq=3DABHICHARA&btnG=3DGoogle+Search&meta=3D&rlz=3D1W1ADBF_en&aq=3Df&oq=3D\n\nT=\r\nhoughts do have energy. That is why if we think good of a person, the good =\r\ncomes to him and vice-versa. Maybe &quot;abhichara&quot; could be the same process ma=\r\nde more potent when encapsulated in a mantra or tantra practices.\n\nOne of m=\r\ny encounters with black magic has been in the context of &quot;nazar utarna&quot;. Th=\r\nere is a practice in northern India (maybe there is a similar variant in so=\r\nuth india too), of dispelling the effect of &quot;an evil eye&quot; on people. Infant=\r\ns probably are more prone to this. I remember my aunt doing the practice of=\r\n &quot;nazar utarna&quot;...taking off the effect of the evil eye...through a certain=\r\n ritual. It was done with &quot;rie&quot; and &quot;noon&quot;...mustard seeds and salt. She co=\r\nuld make out when the eye was cast by the way the eyelashes of the infant c=\r\nurled up. Then after performing a small practice the effect of the evil eye=\r\n could be neutralised. I dont exactly recall the practice but when i watche=\r\nd her doing it one day i was truly amazed how the ingredients caught fire.\n=\r\n\nLong years back i also recall how my mother engaged the services of an &quot;oj=\r\nha&quot; / excorcist (?) to make my brother recover from jaundice. We were not a=\r\nllowed to watch this but i am told that the man chanted some mantras while =\r\nperforming some rituals using water. The colour of water turned yellow. My =\r\nbrother too recovered. Maybe it was only a belief. But once again the amazi=\r\nng thing was that the water turned yellow.\n\nThough such things are indeed f=\r\nascinating i bellieve we should not engage in them for two reasons....they =\r\nare for short term gains and secondly these practices could be dangerous.\n\n=\r\nBut then the question arises...are not all practices for gains (it could be=\r\n spiritual gains too)???\n\nMaybe practices are required to get us THERE? / m=\r\nake us understand that we were always THERE?\n\nTHERE being WHERE, in the wor=\r\nds of Shankaracharya, there is: \n\n&quot;Na Punyam Na Papam Na Saukhyam Na Dukham=\r\n\nNa Mantro Na Teertham Na Vedo Na Yajnaha\nAham Bhojanam Naiva Bhojyam Na Bh=\r\nokta\nChidananda Rupa Shivoham Shivoham&quot;\n\nWhat is the best way to get there =\r\nremains for each one of us to explore and find out....over lifetimes...\n\nBe=\r\nst wishes to all of us on this journey to know that we were always at the d=\r\nestination........\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vemparlara=\r\nmkishore&quot; &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Bivash \n&gt; \n&gt; I had similar d=\r\noubts previously but after reading Aghora at the left hand of god , those d=\r\noubts were cleared. Please take the below only as something that has been g=\r\nathered from books and so that the nagging question in your mind is laid to=\r\n rest.Learned members can kindly correct if any mistakes are done in intrep=\r\nretation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Often this question can also take the form of &quot; Why should g=\r\nod have an ugra roopa....should not god always be calm patient...loving &quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Whether that is the case or is it a case of the observer attributing th=\r\nese qualities to god is a also a valid question. Often appearances are dece=\r\nptive.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.Tantra has six rites of destruction as well ( Marana , Ucchat=\r\nana,Vidveshana...etc etc ) . Also tantra has abhichara prayogas to cause th=\r\ne destruction of enemies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two instances where it has been mentioned in=\r\n the classics is \n&gt; \n&gt; 2.Meghanada the son of Ravana begins an Abhichara ho=\r\nma which if completed would have made him invincible.Lord Hanuman and Laksh=\r\nmana stop the homa before it is completed and slay Meghanada.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.Sudaks=\r\nhina son of Vasudeva of Kasi ( Vasudeva is killed by Krishna in the battle =\r\nof Kasi) does an Abhichara and sends an fiend to attack Krishna in Dwaraka.=\r\n Krishna repels the Fiend and with any Abhichara when repelled it will turn=\r\n against the one who has intiated it. Kasi is burnt down and this is mentio=\r\nned as the incident of Kasi burnt by Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The six destructive r=\r\nites are only to be used for specific purposes relating to war , these are =\r\nnot rites for ordinary human beings. They carry terrible terrible consequen=\r\nces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Left hand tantra ( Please note Left hand is not used in any derog=\r\natory sense) contains similar other practises as well....\n&gt; \n&gt; Take for exa=\r\nmple : Vashikarana...and Bali \n&gt; \n&gt; The rite itself has many variations and=\r\n many purposes. Used on a lower level it is used to control others to do yo=\r\nur bidding...Used on a higher level it can attract a bhairavi ...whom if yo=\r\nu have the right attitude you can accept as a mother and learn a lot from.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda has also clarified the use of Bali. In the pure sense t=\r\nhe surrender of ego....But he has also clarified the use of pashu bali.....=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Kamakhya one of the most sacred Pithas of the Goddess does an yearly =\r\nbali of goats....Yet it is said to be one of the most peaceful places on ea=\r\nrth to meditate . Only goats with special markings on their bodies are used=\r\n....when the priest does the bali he is directly sending them to the abode =\r\nof kali..In a way it is a boon for the being in the body of the goat.It wil=\r\nl surely come back as a human being.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just like a forest fire app=\r\nears destructive on the surface ....but it is a proven scientific fact that=\r\n the growth of trees is highest after a forest fire occurs .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tantra=\r\n especially the Left hand kind is not for the faint of heart...nor is it fo=\r\nr the timid in mind. Vimalananda in the very beginning had to do a shava sa=\r\ndhana before he could have a vision of his most compassionate Smashana Tara=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is a very powerful path with rapid progress but the pitfalls a=\r\nre many without the guidance of a Sadhguru...probably the reason Tantra was=\r\n heavily put down later in the later period when most traditions got distor=\r\nted.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My Two Cents\n&gt; \n&gt; Ram Kishore \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bivash Ramroop&quot; &lt;bivaash108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Om Brihas=\r\npataye Namah\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji and members, \n&gt; &gt; Namaste and Hare K=\r\nrishna\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Recently I was chatting to someone online that mentioned in=\r\ndrajal. I gathered from our chat that it was something to do with black mag=\r\nic. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I got home today, I asked my grandmother and she refused=\r\n to tell me what it was. I googled it and came across as it being a book of=\r\n tantra dealing with the darker aspects- potential to damage others. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; On one of the books, there is a picture of Ma Kali. And one shop that s=\r\nells it online mentions Das MahaVidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So my question is, if all t=\r\nhese mantras that exist that can harm other people, who empowers these mant=\r\nras? I really find it hard to believe that Ma will give power to people to =\r\nharm others. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do know from Vedic stories about devas granting bo=\r\nons to demons, for example- Hiranyakashipu&#39;s story. But, considering we are=\r\n in Kali Yuga, does this still happen? People are more likely to die from A=\r\nIDS, cancer etc, so whats the big deal with black magic? Is this just child=\r\nish superstition or all part of a larger work of karma?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for =\r\nthe questions, its just been annoying me at the back of my mind. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nJaya Sita Raama\n&gt; &gt; Bivash\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
