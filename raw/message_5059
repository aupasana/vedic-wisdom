One should read =\r\nbooks and booklets of them. Its also available online.\n\nOn Mon, 11 Oct 2010=\r\n 04:07 BST Narasimha PVR Rao wrote:\n\n&gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt;A member of this=\r\n group gifted me a book when he met me for a saamoohika Satya Narayana vrat=\r\nam we conducted at Cary, North Carolina last year. I finally got to read a =\r\nlittle from it. I am impressed with this work.\n&gt; \n&gt;The book is called &quot;Inva=\r\nding the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in America&quot; (editors: Kris=\r\nhnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). It has 29 scholarly=\r\n articles organized in 4 sections.\n&gt; \n&gt;Perverted scholars with perverted an=\r\nti-Hindu agendas that look down upon India and Hinduism with a colonial vie=\r\nwpoint have conducted perverted researches in the name of academic freedom =\r\nat the religious studies departments of western universities, published the=\r\nm and gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in the process. Crying fou=\r\nl or getting frustrated with this will not improve the situation or solve t=\r\nhe problem. Interested religious scholars have to firmly and patiently crti=\r\nque these works in the same academic style, in order to reclaim the rightfu=\r\nl place for Hinduism.\n&gt; \n&gt;Several papers in this book do exactly that. They=\r\n take specific works by western scholars and rebut them quite well and show=\r\n how they are fallacious, hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipul=\r\native or filled with lies.\n&gt; \n&gt;*        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;I will just give an =\r\nexample of the offensive work that was rebutted in this book. [Warning: Tho=\r\nse who are sensitive to offensive writings should skip the next three parag=\r\nraphs.]\n&gt; \n&gt;Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission=\r\n in West Bengal and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people=\r\n there enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, what he p=\r\nroduced is utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD d=\r\nissertation without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for f=\r\nactual or linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out abo=\r\nut what he produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based o=\r\nn the PhD dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an award at th=\r\ne Americal Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and h=\r\nis book was sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number o=\r\nne* choice for learning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt; \n&gt;In the book, he portrayed Ra=\r\nmakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. He =\r\ndid not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help from a=\r\nny Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He used his own faulty tran=\r\nslations, willful distortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at sens=\r\national (and damning) conclusions. For example, he translated a word that m=\r\neans &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual so=\r\nn of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He tra=\r\nnslated a word that means &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing sand=\r\nalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;Even in places where there was no mate=\r\nrial to mis-translate, he simply speculated! For example, he speculated on =\r\nthe meeting of Totapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked as=\r\ncetic) Totapuri taught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyon=\r\nd Mother Kali and experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been li=\r\nke for Ramakrishna, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days i=\r\nn a small hut with another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it=\r\n was this man&#39;s nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caugh=\r\nt Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he is not re=\r\nferring to any source and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based =\r\non his perverted agenda!\n&gt; \n&gt;*        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;If you see the book, y=\r\nou will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship driven by heinous agen=\r\ndas. It is a fact that many perverted people under asuric influences make t=\r\nheir livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading falsehoods about Hindui=\r\nsm, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n&gt; \n&gt;Those who are not inclined to fight=\r\n a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this and go on doing their sadhana=\r\n. After all, if enough people do sadhana to strengthen sanatana dharma, thi=\r\ns kind of things will automatically weaken. However, some scholars engaging=\r\n these pseudo-scholars academically is really required on the ground. We ne=\r\ned to give our encouragement to the pioneers who are doing this important s=\r\ncholarly rebuttal.\n&gt; \n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free =\r\nJyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =\r\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;-------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
