As i read =\r\nfurther i am getting confused. Maybe i am misunderstanding something. For e=\r\nxample\n\n1) If this whole world originates from man&#39;s imaginations. why all =\r\npeople are imagining the same thing?\n\n2) If all other people and things are=\r\n just product of my imagination why do they behave or why do things occur i=\r\nn a way i had never imagined? why do things occur in a way i had never know=\r\nn ?\n\n3) How does karma fruit theory fits in? if all the world is just my ma=\r\nnah sankalpa how do i commit karma against any soul? How can i have rinanub=\r\nandha against my own imagination?\n\nRespected Sir,  there is some esoteric m=\r\neaning in the stories. i am currently  reading rain leela and raja vidurath=\r\n story.  please explain or  give some indication about esoteric meaning of =\r\nthe story. In book itself it is written that all stories have hidden meanin=\r\ng which are needed to be understood. i wasn&#39;t able to grasp the meaning. pl=\r\nease help.\nI shall be very thankful to you.\n\nRegards\nAtul\n\n\n"}}
