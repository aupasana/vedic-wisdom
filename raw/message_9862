Everyone,\n=C2=A0\nI just thought of adding some clarifications.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nFirst of all, when I mentioned about the utility of techniques of &quot;Hypn=\r\notherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for handling the problem of spirit att=\r\nachments as well as many other problems for which we do not have reasonable=\r\n explanation, my assertions were limited to the utility part only and not b=\r\neyond that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in f=\r\nact I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, an=\r\ny knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half kno=\r\nwledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our thi=\r\ns empirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fa=\r\nct of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Su=\r\nn does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still w=\r\ne use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in t=\r\nhe west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activities whi=\r\nch helps\n in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d mentioned ab=\r\nout &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nOne should not commen=\r\nt about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full=\r\n of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just c=\r\nan not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Bef=\r\nore anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0m=\r\nust first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to =\r\nsay that if=C2=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would =\r\ndefinitely be convinced about the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t m=\r\nake comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by d=\r\noing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=\r\n=A0blind belief in religion and religious practices=C2=A0can be termed as d=\r\nogmatic but also in science if one loses the scientific temper.\n=C2=A0\nProo=\r\nf of pudding is in eating it, all that I can say to the persons willing to =\r\naddress any of their problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; ha=\r\nve immense utility for=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their prob=\r\nlems with an open mind. Those who are interested can read &quot; Many Lives, Man=\r\ny Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to start with.\n=C2=A0\nTo respected Narasimha sir,=\r\n I would like to inform that these are not &quot;new age ideas&quot;. These were ther=\r\ne much before in India. to cite concept of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; of Jainism is one=\r\n among them. Jainas used this technique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renu=\r\nnciation in the followers.\n=C2=A0\nTo Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform t=\r\nhat=C2=A0so far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be =\r\ndone over phone, but however, there are so many problems which can be handl=\r\ned even over phone. To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recu=\r\nrrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me fo=\r\nr the treatment.=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping=\r\n at a far off place for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worse=\r\nned as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 started affecting her professional career adversel=\r\ny. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone=\r\n. The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she got r=\r\nelieved from her that recurrent dream and also started improving her profes=\r\nsional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nIt all depends on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to =\r\novercome etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what we can see an=\r\nd what we can believe to see.\n=C2=A0\nRegards\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, October=\r\n 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n  \n=C2=A0=\r\n \nNamaste,\n\nTo add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understa=\r\nnding of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems=\r\n. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific mom=\r\nents from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consc=\r\niousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opp=\r\nortunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be =\r\nrecalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolv=\r\ned and new set is generated based on need.\n\nThe Buddhists do not believe in=\r\n the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our =\r\nidea of Atmah. Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. I=\r\nt is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n t=\r\no give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disinteg=\r\nrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these =\r\ncan coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts c=\r\nan simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part.=\r\n =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation=\r\n, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anot=\r\nher part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like=\r\n a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his =\r\nenergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarna=\r\nting in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with=\r\n their philosophy.\n\nThose philosophies which believed in this kind of a rei=\r\nncarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governe=\r\nd only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain =\r\nscriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get =\r\nrid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirva=\r\nna. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tenden=\r\ncy towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n\nBut t=\r\nhe old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolve=\r\nd at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to anot=\r\nher and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this sou=\r\nl&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body ve=\r\nhicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique =\r\nsoul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able t=\r\no *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine L=\r\nife.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only o=\r\nne among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state \nof complet=\r\ne negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there w=\r\nas just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. T=\r\nhe law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of gi=\r\nve and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The import=\r\nant thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth=\r\n to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediate=\r\nly. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That i=\r\ns why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can tra=\r\nnsform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born =\r\na hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whereas=\r\n those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are=\r\n firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take o=\r\nf energy. \n\nNow since the soul is what remembers and everything else being =\r\nperishable, the only indestructible link between past life and present life=\r\n, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete =\r\ncinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have be=\r\nen lives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then t=\r\nhose are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature,=\r\n those lives serve no purpose at all. \n\n\nMoreover all these are possible ON=\r\nLY if and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a ver=\r\ny very strong manner. That is not easy. \n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\nI have=\r\n a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be s=\r\nure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all=\r\n.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Hanuman, Bhairava, C=\r\nhandi, Narasimha - so many deities can be worshipped for this purpose.

This really requires some shakti=\r\n and the ability to direct it for this specific task.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Though I l=\r\nive in the area, I am not capable of doing anything personally. However, if=\r\n anybody in troubles like this is interested and visits me, I can give some=\r\n ash from my daily homam of divine Mother.

I am sure there too one can find good exorci=\r\nsts, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge about =\r\nPanchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhan=\r\na of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particular mantra =\r\nof Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency for these k=\r\nind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. A=\r\ns per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose mothe=\r\nr is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Rudraya=\r\nmala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has be=\r\nen\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for pro=\r\ntection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation ground.=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra t=\r\noo, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru V=\r\natukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should=\r\n be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time =\r\nthat there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a re=\r\nally genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would=\r\n be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. Th=\r\nese days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of p=\r\nossession from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a mu=\r\nst for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with =\r\nthe girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam =\r\nmanual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra.=\r\n But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If =\r\nthe family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if poss=\r\nible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhair=\r\nava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the pro=\r\nblem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairav=\r\na live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may =\r\ncharge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl t=\r\no come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the templ=\r\ne and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This=\r\n is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what =\r\ncame to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajars=\r\nhi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To =\r\ngrasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pu=\r\nrsue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;___=\r\n_____________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 =\r\nPM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (a=\r\nt nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For t=\r\nhere are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess =\r\nan individual and some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are ma=\r\nny. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work=\r\n, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specif=\r\nic case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarante=\r\ne of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has poss=\r\nessed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means =\r\none has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them=\r\n to enter into the person.\n Sometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as sp=\r\nitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into t=\r\nheir territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness=\r\n in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberatel=\r\ny send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, the=\r\nre is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situatio=\r\nn. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti tha=\r\nt those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.M=\r\noreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then u=\r\nnless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come t=\r\no serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specializa=\r\ntions. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one know=\r\ns well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense w=\r\nould do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must k=\r\nnow well how to\n handle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by forc=\r\ne before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to b=\r\ne in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain =\r\nwhich will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tri=\r\ned to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a=\r\n particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=\r\n But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=\r\n the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=\r\nssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=\r\n Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=\r\nody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=\r\nver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=\r\ne the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nBest thing to do is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spi=\r\nrit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not poss=\r\nible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably B=\r\nhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are=\r\n better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time.=\r\n Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on=\r\n the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with a=\r\nny sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this thro=\r\nugh to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copp=\r\ner pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sp=\r\nrinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck an=\r\nd may God help the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in=\r\n, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee lik=\r\ne a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;________________=\r\n________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday=\r\n, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for prot=\r\nection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Ni=\r\nthin, I will convey this to the parents.

I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, b=\r\nut I feel whether something divine or rather evil is present in a certain p=\r\nlace. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there f=\r\nor 10 days and every night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody=\r\n staring at me - I could see them but once I started focusing on them, they=\r\n vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly=\r\n. One day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I rea=\r\nched for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like =\r\nsleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my bo=\r\ndy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sl=\r\neep?

Reincarnation is of the =\r\nsoul, and the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives when =\r\nthe soul had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if o=\r\nne has lived a life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to c=\r\nome forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a c=\r\nomplete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generate=\r\nd based on need.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Buddhists do not =\r\nbelieve in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is simil=\r\nar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very d=\r\nifferent. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces =\r\ntogether\n to give the impression of an individual being, which upon death g=\r\net disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s=\r\n) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some ot=\r\nher parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a diff=\r\nerent part. &nbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of re=\r\nincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body=\r\n while another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneo=\r\nusly*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person,=\r\n while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of b=\r\nody incarnating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! I=\r\nt fits with their philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those ph=\r\nilosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Uni=\r\nverse only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n =\r\ndebts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with =\r\nthis term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life =\r\nand move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here th=\r\nat is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal=\r\n renunciation of life and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;non=\r\ne&quot;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not =\r\ndissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life=\r\n to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop =\r\nthis soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind=\r\n/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and=\r\n unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, b=\r\ne able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a =\r\nDivine Life.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot th=\r\ne ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; mov=\r\ning into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and =\r\ninevitable aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and pe=\r\nrform complex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, but it is=\r\n not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case o=\r\nf the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is help=\r\ning the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it c=\r\nhanges the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfa=\r\niling and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must h=\r\nave killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ =\r\nhe did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the h=\r\nands of those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nw=\r\nhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe =\r\nlaw of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv class=3D&quot;yiv1069419871ms__id1914 yiv1069419871ms__id664&quot; style=3D&quot;color:=\r\n rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-s=\r\nize: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br cl=\r\near=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1069419871ms__id1915 yiv10694198=\r\n71ms__id665&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: times new roman, ne=\r\nw york, times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color=\r\n: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything e=\r\nlse being perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and pr=\r\nesent life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a=\r\n complete cinematic biography recollection.
