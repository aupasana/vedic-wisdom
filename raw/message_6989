One who has studied the Vedas, and who has direct knowledg=\r\ne of the Atman (Self) through Anubhava (experience), can alone be enrolled =\r\nas a Guru. A Jivanmukta or liberated sage is the real Guru or spiritual pre=\r\nceptor. He is the Sadguru. He is identical with Brahman or the Supreme Self=\r\n. He is a Knower of Brahman.\nA Sadguru is endowed with countless Siddhis (p=\r\nsychic powers). He possesses all divine Aisvarya (powers), all the wealth o=\r\nf the Lord.\n\nPossession of Siddhis, however, is not the test to declare the=\r\n greatness of a sage or to prove that he has attained Self-realisation. Sad=\r\ngurus generally do not exhibit any miracle or Siddhi. Sometimes, however, t=\r\nhey may do so in order to convince the aspirants of the existence of superp=\r\nhysical things, give them encouragement, and instill faith in their hearts.=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
