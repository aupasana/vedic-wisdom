One may tell him, \n&quot;if you close this door, monster won&#39;t come&quot; or &quot;if you light this \nbright light in your room, monster won&#39;t come&quot; or &quot;if you stop crying, \nmonster won&#39;t come&quot; or &quot;if you do so and so thing, monster won&#39;t come&quot;.\n\nThe child may be afraid of the monster and do several things to prevent \nthe monster from coming and hurting him. That is a good thing.\n\nBut the basic factor is that there is NO monster in the next room! ;-) \nHowever, if you just declare that to the child, the child will never \ncompletely overcome the fear. Instead, use the pretext of safety from \nmonster to make the child to do some good things. Eventually, the child \nwill realize that there is no monster.\n\n*        *        *\n\nRituals and all sadhanas we do are kind of like the good things the \nchild in the analogy does to remain safe from the monster. The notion \nthat we are not divine and that we experience good and bad things is the \nmonster. Just as a monster is very real for the child, this notion is \nvery real for us. Just pretending bravery that there is no monster will \nnot lift the grip of an imaginary monster on the mind.\n\nDo various things to make you feel comfortable. But, in the end, the \nmonster you are trying to remain safe from does not even exist...\n\n*        *        *\n\nI do not appreciate those who downplay rituals and sadhana and say that \nall is god. If you are down with a severe disease or your limbs are cut \noff and you still see god in that suffering and remain in an exalted \nstate, then you can claim that all is god. Otherwise, all is NOT god for \nyou. More sadhana is needed to internalize the theoretical statements.\n\nAt the same time, those who enquire about minute details of rituals are \nlike an innocent child who asks, &quot;to keep the monster at bay, is it \nbetter to do my homnework in a red notebook or a blue notebook?&quot; \nBottomline is that the monster is unreal and it is good to do your \nhomework irrespective of which notebook you use. As the child learns \nmore, works more and grows intellectually, oneday he will realize that \nthe monster is unreal.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI&#39;ve been busy. I will try to reply to some specific questions in \nfuture. But, the fundamental answer to many questions is given above! \nRest assured that most details being sought are not that important. Have \nfaith in god, surrender to god and do homam with the faith that god IS \nreally in fire. Despite any procedural shortcomings, you WILL make \nspiritual progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
