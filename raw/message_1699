Before I answer it, I want to say that I am =\r\nimpressed with the decription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he l=\r\nive in the greater Boston area too?\n \n*        *        *\n \nKarma and karma=\r\nphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and being pushing ba=\r\nck as a reaction.\n \nWhen you karmically push an object with some force and =\r\nthat object pushes you back karmically with the same force at a later point=\r\n of time, it is not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force =\r\nto push again. You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed =\r\nnow. That is reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not=\r\n has nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist =\r\nand apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reacti=\r\non later.\n \n*        *        *\n \nEven a person of a high level of mental e=\r\nquanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living person has a limited =\r\nego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha =\r\nRao, who looks like this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so th=\r\nings, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the=\r\n father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc =\r\netc). If the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbou=\r\nnd from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body=\r\n. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and g=\r\nets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and environ=\r\nment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature tracks this ch=\r\nange. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to your old apartment=\r\n to your new apartment when you change address, Nature delivers the reactio=\r\nns of all previous life actions to the sense of I-ness in this life.\n \nAs l=\r\nong as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will continue to d=\r\neliver the reactions to various previous actions from that being. Death of =\r\nwife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an election, being crit=\r\nicized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being abused by husband, bein=\r\ng killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend etc etc are examples of re=\r\nactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s sense of I-ness is bound to a=\r\n body, Nature will continue to deliver reactions to previous actions. If on=\r\ne gets an Oscar award as a result of previous good karma, it is not necessa=\r\nry that one should be happy or excited or elated. Do not think that a react=\r\nion from Nature to one&#39;s good karma is meaningful only if that reaction mak=\r\nes one happy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not=\r\n necessary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction =\r\nfrom Nature to one&#39;s bad karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoi=\r\nnts him. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such that that person che=\r\nats you now. How you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old ac=\r\ntion-reaction equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded a=\r\nnd calm does not stop Nature from doing its job.\n \nIn fact, it is better th=\r\nat way. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is preventing new kar=\r\nmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arrang=\r\ned for that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction =\r\nto your own action (but if he does it with self-identification with the act=\r\nion, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you=\r\n). If you just face it calmly and without doing anything, you finish off yo=\r\nur karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to stop the person from =\r\ncheating you. Then your current actions would become a NEW karma and you wi=\r\nll have to face its reaction later. If you want to pay off old debts withou=\r\nt incurring new ones, you have to behave like the person you described belo=\r\nw. Accept whatever comes your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but w=\r\nith a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the r=\r\night thing to do at the moment, with as little self-identification (sense o=\r\nf &quot;I am doing this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instin=\r\ncts and judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n \nBes=\r\nt regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homa=\r\nm\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------- \n \n----- Original Message ----- \nSent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:=\r\n02 PM\nSubject: Karma\n \n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; How does one burn their karma=\r\ns if they are able to be in a neutral frame \n&gt; of mind and not be affected =\r\nby what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt;\n&gt; A close family friend of ours lost =\r\nhis wife in a road accident a few years \n&gt; ago.
