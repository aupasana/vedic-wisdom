It is an emanation of inner=\r\n harmony and peace\nreflected in a pure heart. What is sorrow? It is an outc=\r\nome of\ninfirmity, an image of ignorance. =C3=82nanda (bliss) is a divine at=\r\ntribute.\nThe eternal complementarity of Shiva and Shakti, Krishna and Radha=\r\n, Ram\nand Sita, Vishnu and Lakshmi, Purusha and Prakrati described in the\nV=\r\nedic scriptures is absolute. So is the pair of ananda and anandamayi\nshakti=\r\n. \n\n\nLife-force cannot express itself without the physical body. The\nSuprem=\r\ne Creator would also remain =E2=80=98non-existent=E2=80=99 without its expr=\r\nession\nin the creation and manifestation of Nature. We would not have been\n=\r\nable to conceptualize or realize the presence of God without having the\nfac=\r\nulties of thoughts and emotions=E2=80=A6. \n\n\nThe roots of unalloyed joy als=\r\no lie in the feel of art and culture.\nEvery expression, every entity, every=\r\n feeling has a basis, a nature of\nits existence. The same is true of happin=\r\ness. The Upanishads describe\nits source of expression as the vigour and rad=\r\niance of the (inner and\nexternal) mind and the body: =E2=80=9CNayamatma Bal=\r\nahinena Labhyah=E2=80=9D; the weak\n(emotionally, mentally, or physically) a=\r\nnd ignorant ones cannot get the\ndelight of the soul, the experience of anan=\r\nda. \n\n\nThe Vedic Shrutis state =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9CBalamupasva=E2=80=9D: Wor=\r\nship\nyour bala =E2=80=93 strength, courage, inner power. The physically wea=\r\nk,\ncoward, ignorant, lethargic and dull persons also miss the real thrills\n=\r\nof life. What to speak of happiness, even sustaining the normal life\nitself=\r\n is too difficult for them. No one except the vigorous,\ncourageous, awakene=\r\nd ones can attain and retain true happiness.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the=\r\n words =E2=80=9Cshakti=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cbala=E2=80=9D used here,\ndon=\r\n=E2=80=99t denote only their literal meanings (power and vigor). Rather,\nth=\r\nese refer to the grand majesty of human life, which is described in\nthe scr=\r\niptures to be expressed in seven faculties. The grand majesty\n(maha bala) l=\r\nies in the harmonious combination of all these seven\nfacets of its expressi=\r\non. As the proper functioning of the human body\nand operations of human lif=\r\ne pertain mainly to the ten senses and the\nmind, so does the sublime spring=\r\n of maha bala flowing through these\nseven streams of power. If there were a=\r\nny impurity, shortcoming or\nblockage in any one of these attributes, it wou=\r\nld, to that extent,\nlessen or deform the total bala too. \n\n\nThe seven attri=\r\nbutes for the expression of (maha)bala are =E2=80=93 (i)\nArt: graceful arti=\r\nstic mode of doing things, civilized etiquette,\ncultured behavior, etc fall=\r\n under the art of living along with the\nsense of appreciation for creativit=\r\ny; (ii) Health: Mental and physical\nhealth; energy, enthusiasm, tolerance, =\r\nindustriousness, vitality of\nsense organs and alertness of mind;(iii) Knowl=\r\nedge: Reading-writing,\nessential information of use on the physical, mental=\r\n, domestic,\neconomical, social, religious, political, geographical, interna=\r\ntional\ntopics; rational thinking, sound reasoning, wisdom, etc are included=\r\n\nhere; (iv) Wealth: Income or resources to enable smooth transaction of\nthe=\r\n essential personal and familial duties through honest means; (v)\nPrestige:=\r\n Respect, faith, cooperation, affection and benevolence of the\nrelatives, f=\r\nriends and social acquaintances; (vi) Friendship:\nAssociation and support o=\r\nf the friends having integrity of character\nand caring concern; (vii) Menta=\r\nl Strength: Courage, valour, generosity,\ncompassion, feelings of service an=\r\nd sacrifice, self-respect,\nresponsibility, inner confidence.\n\n\n\nThese seven=\r\n sources of inner strength are the key instruments for\nachieving fulfillmen=\r\nt and success in any domain of life. Human life\ndevoid of these powers is h=\r\nelpless and insignificant like those of the\ntiny insects. Only those, who p=\r\nossess this treasure of bala can boldly\nface the ups and downs of the world=\r\nly life and steadily cross the ocean\nof sorrows, adversities and ever new c=\r\nhallenges. Perennial happiness is\na boon of these seven attributes of the =\r\n=E2=80=98God=E2=80=99 named =E2=80=9Cmahabala=E2=80=9D. Success\ncrowns thos=\r\ne endowed with the radiance of vigor, prudence, courage,\nintegrity, assidui=\r\nty, benevolence and majesty of spirit. Those lacking\nin bala face failures =\r\nand being unable to fight the Nature=E2=80=99s law of\n=E2=80=98survival of =\r\nthe fittest=E2=80=99 are, sooner or later, cast away in the\n=E2=80=98strugg=\r\nle for existence=E2=80=99=E2=80=A6. \n\n\nTherefore, dear readers of =E2=80=9C=\r\nAkhand Jyoti,=E2=80=9D arise and start\ncultivating unalloyed happiness in y=\r\nour life. The only way to do it is\nto generate power from within. Be strong=\r\n; only then you will be able to\ncross the turbulent and turgid streams of a=\r\ngonies and adversities. Also\nremember that happiness and progress are not u=\r\nnilateral; neither can\nthese be sustained in isolation. If you alone are st=\r\nout, intelligent,\nresourceful and satisfied but others around you remain do=\r\nwntrodden,\nweak and ignorant, how will you be happy? How will you digest an=\r\nd enjoy\nlavish food if you try eating it while sitting amongst those starvi=\r\nng\nto eat even a meal of coarse grains and those dying from hunger=E2=80=A6=\r\n?\nAttempting to do so will be rather cruel on your part. The cry of their\ns=\r\nufferings, their jealousy, their oppression would also have a negative\neffe=\r\nct on your selfish attempts of =E2=80=98enjoyment=E2=80=99. The real taste =\r\nand joy\nof food appears when you eat it in a cheerful mood with your friend=\r\ns or\nfamily members=E2=80=A6. A healthy person cannot remain healthy for lo=\r\nng if he\nis to live with the patients of cholera, plague, tuberculosis or o=\r\nther\ncontagious diseases. Likewise, the strength, affluence and abilities o=\r\nf\na person cannot make him truly happy and calm if the people around him\nar=\r\ne plunged in the filth of infirmities, scarcities and agonies. \n\n\nKnow this=\r\n, all aspirants for happiness! And therefore pursue the\nmotto of =E2=80=9Cl=\r\nive and let live=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cyou rise and uplift the oth=\r\ners too,=E2=80=9D\n=E2=80=9Cbe happy and make others happy=E2=80=9D=E2=80=A6=\r\n. Sprinkle the shower of your\nstrength, talents, resources and joy upon oth=\r\ners as well=E2=80=A6. =E2=80=9CPower and\nService=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CCapabil=\r\nities and Altruism=E2=80=9D together should be the aim of\nyour life if you =\r\nreally seek for lasting delight and progress in your\nlife. This is the idea=\r\nl of yoga. Literal meaning of =E2=80=9Cyoga=E2=80=9D is\ncombination of two =\r\nthings.You =E2=80=93 the sadhakas of yoga, the seekers of\nsupreme enlighten=\r\nment, should first recognize the key to accomplishment\nof yoga-sadhana; it =\r\nis hidden in the two-fold objectives of =E2=80=9Cknowledge\nand compassion=\r\n=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cpossession and generosity=E2=80=9D.\n\n\n\nYou should combi=\r\nne your selfishness with selflessness, cravings\nwith satisfaction. Your bod=\r\ny finds joy in comforts but your soul always\nseeks inner peace. The body ne=\r\neds vigor, the soul needs soothing\nfeelings of compassion and loving kindne=\r\nss. Selfishness is desired by\nthe body, by the worldly self, while altruist=\r\nic pursuits satisfy the\ninner self, the soul. Try to integrate the two. Thi=\r\ns yoga will enrich your life with enormous joy and light.  This will bestow=\r\n true happiness upon you.\n\n\n\nA cart has two wheels. Our body also stands an=\r\nd moves on two legs.\nClapping becomes possible with the active participatio=\r\nn of both the\nhands. Man and woman both together make a complete human. The=\r\n grand\nchariot of happiness in our life also has two august wheels, two gol=\r\nden\npillars, two marvellous horses =E2=80=93 one is =E2=80=9Cbala=E2=80=9D =\r\nand the other is =E2=80=9Cseva=E2=80=9D\n(compassionate altruistic service).=\r\n Cultivate and harvest your bala and\nalso employ it in seva. Connection of =\r\nthe powerful poles of negative\nand positive charges generates a strong curr=\r\nent of electricity. The\ncommingling of the grand sources of potentials and =\r\nsocial-service\nsimilarly produces the nectar of unalloyed happiness=E2=80=\r\n=A6. One experiences\nimmense delight, enchantment and enlightened empowerme=\r\nnt through heart\nafter adopting this yoga in life. \n\n\n\nConsider yourself as=\r\n a soldier of the savior army of the Almighty,\nwhich has descended on the e=\r\narth to generate and expand all round\nhappiness in this world. =E2=80=9CRis=\r\ne and Uplift=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CBe Happy and Make Others\nHappy=E2=80=9D sho=\r\nuld be your theme songs in your march forward towards the\ngoal of universal=\r\n happiness, harmony and peace. Following these\nsincerely in every dimension=\r\n of life is true devotion. God is pleased\nwith such devotees. HE looks afte=\r\nr their wellbeing and bestows such\ndevotees with divine grace. \n\n\n      \r\n--0-606619740-1256277604=:11898\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Akhand Jyoti, Mar-Apr 2003, magazine =\r\npublished by the All World Gayatri Parivar&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;font face=3D&quot;=\r\nVerdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font=\r\n face=3D&quot;Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt; \n            &lt;/p&gt;\n        \n         \n           \n              \n         =\r\n       \nEvery one aspires for a satisfied, cheerful, progressive and fulfil=\r\nling\nlife.

Human life\ndevoid of these powers is helpless and insignificant =\r\nlike those of the\ntiny insects. Only those, who possess this treasure of ba=\r\nla can boldly\nface the ups and downs of the worldly life and steadily cross=\r\n the ocean\nof sorrows, adversities and ever new challenges. Perennial happi=\r\nness is\na boon of these seven attributes of the =E2=80=98God=E2=80=99 named=\r\n =E2=80=9Cmahabala=E2=80=9D. Success\ncrowns those endowed with the radiance=\r\n of vigor, prudence, courage,\nintegrity, assiduity, benevolence and majesty=\r\n of spirit. Those lacking\nin bala face failures and being unable to fight t=\r\nhe Nature=E2=80=99s law of\n=E2=80=98survival of the fittest=E2=80=99 are, s=\r\nooner or later, cast away in the\n=E2=80=98struggle for existence=E2=80=99=\r\n=E2=80=A6. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Therefore, dear readers of =E2=80=9CAkhand Jyoti,=E2=80=\r\n=9D arise and start\ncultivating unalloyed happiness in your life. The only =\r\nway to do it is\nto generate power from within. Be strong; only then you wil=\r\nl be able to\ncross the turbulent and turgid streams of agonies and adversit=\r\nies. Also\nremember that happiness and progress are not unilateral; neither =\r\ncan\nthese be sustained in isolation. If you alone are stout, intelligent,\nr=\r\nesourceful and satisfied but others around you remain downtrodden,\nweak and=\r\n ignorant, how will you be happy? How will you digest and enjoy\nlavish food=\r\n if you try eating it while sitting amongst those starving\nto eat even a me=\r\nal of coarse grains and those dying from hunger=E2=80=A6?\nAttempting to do =\r\nso will be rather cruel on your part. The cry of their\nsufferings, their je=\r\nalousy, their oppression would also have a negative\neffect on your selfish =\r\nattempts of =E2=80=98enjoyment=E2=80=99. The real taste and joy\nof food app=\r\nears when you eat it in a cheerful mood with your friends or\nfamily members=\r\n=E2=80=A6. A healthy person cannot remain healthy for long if he\nis to live=\r\n with the patients of cholera, plague, tuberculosis or other\ncontagious dis=\r\neases. Likewise, the strength, affluence and abilities of\na person cannot m=\r\nake him truly happy and calm if the people around him\nare plunged in the fi=\r\nlth of infirmities, scarcities and agonies. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Know this, all aspiran=\r\nts for happiness! And therefore pursue the\nmotto of =E2=80=9Clive and let l=\r\nive=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Cyou rise and uplift the others too,=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n=E2=80=9Cbe happy and make others happy=E2=80=9D=E2=80=A6. Sprinkle =\r\nthe shower of your\nstrength, talents, resources and joy upon others as well=\r\n=E2=80=A6. =E2=80=9CPower and\nService=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CCapabilities and A=\r\nltruism=E2=80=9D together should be the aim of\nyour life if you really seek=\r\n for lasting delight and progress in your\nlife. This is the ideal of yoga. =\r\nLiteral meaning of =E2=80=9Cyoga=E2=80=9D is\ncombination of two things.You =\r\n=E2=80=93 the sadhakas of yoga, the seekers of\nsupreme enlightenment, shoul=\r\nd first recognize the key to accomplishment\nof yoga-sadhana; it is hidden i=\r\nn the two-fold objectives of =E2=80=9Cknowledge\nand compassion=E2=80=9D, =\r\n=E2=80=9Cpossession and generosity=E2=80=9D.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;You should combine yo=\r\nur selfishness with selflessness, cravings\nwith satisfaction. Your body fin=\r\nds joy in comforts but your soul always\nseeks inner peace. The body needs v=\r\nigor, the soul needs soothing\nfeelings of compassion and loving kindness. S=\r\nelfishness is desired by\nthe body, by the worldly self, while altruistic pu=\r\nrsuits satisfy the\ninner self, the soul. Try to integrate the two.
