Taaraa means crossing and she is the one who=\r\n helps us cross-over \n&gt; &gt; from the material plane to the spiritual plane. R=\r\naama also had to cross \n&gt; &gt; the ocean to get Sita. Esoterically, Raama is t=\r\nhe soul, Lakshmana is the \n&gt; &gt; single-pointed concentration (lakshya-mana) =\r\nand Sita is the Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; Shakti. Raavana who stands for our material =\r\ndesires steals Sita and takes \n&gt; &gt; her away to Lanka, stands for how our ma=\r\nterial desires makes the kundalini \n&gt; &gt; remain in the mooladhara. The beeja=\r\n akshara of Mooladhaara is Lam, which \n&gt; &gt; is what Lanka is.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Munda =\r\nMaala tantra has other parallels (equating Das Mahaavidya & Das \n&gt; &gt; Avataa=\r\nra) too, some of which makes sense and some of them dont.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope this=\r\n helps.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Narayan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
