I was going to repl=\r\ny by cc&#39;ing to \n&gt; the list anonymously, but was busy.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. You can start=\r\n with Ganapathi homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Well, then visualize Ganapathi as the belove=\r\nd little child of your \n&gt; Devi Ma, who will take you to Devi Ma, and not as=\r\n the all-pervading \n&gt; essence.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Homam done at such times is more use=\r\nful, because it can reduce any \n&gt; unwanted karmic burden that may be being =\r\ncarried by the soul in womb. \n&gt; Good luck and hope you get a blessed child.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, some of the good vasanas of the soul in womb may actually ha=\r\nve \n&gt; helped you consider homam at this time! When a new soul comes near yo=\r\nu, \n&gt; it causes changes based on its nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may stop homam for a =\r\nfew days after delivery. But you can do it \n&gt; without any worries until the=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Yes!\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. An auspicious day for the first homam is a good ide=\r\na. But we (people \n&gt; of this age) are not really that good in identifying a=\r\nuspicious times. \n&gt; Our knowledge is weak. So pray to Devi Ma and start whe=\r\nn convenient. In \n&gt; any case, this month is very good. Rishi Panchami (in 1=\r\n-2 days) and \n&gt; Vaisakha Pournami are awesome days. In fact, first fortnigh=\r\nt of Vaisakha \n&gt; month is very auspicious over all.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Doing at home c=\r\nreates a positive energy at home and so good. But many \n&gt; open spaces and n=\r\natural settings are more conducive to divine presence. \n&gt; Do wherever it is=\r\n convenient.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the best!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Ap=\r\nr 22, 2012 at 2:54 PM, vasu_vipin wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I f=\r\neel blessed to have chanced upon this yahoo group! For the last \n&gt; couple o=\r\nf years, I have witnessed a gradual yet strong inclination \n&gt; towards spiri=\r\ntuality, religion, rituals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish. I \n&gt; have been read=\r\ning a lot about them, mostly via the internet, some \n&gt; readings more helpfu=\r\nl than others, but each drawing me closer towards \n&gt; learning more and unde=\r\nrstanding better. A lot of what I read here, in \n&gt; this yahoo-group, is one=\r\n of the most lucid explanation of spirituality, \n&gt; and the final goal of ev=\r\nery saadhana, and the link between spirituality \n&gt; and rituals, yoga, ayurv=\r\neda, and leading a simple and humble life.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have downloaded the book =\r\ncompiled from your writings on spiritual \n&gt; matters and I am in the process=\r\n of reading that as well, and derive \n&gt; great happiness in reading it. I al=\r\nso visited your website and saw a \n&gt; wealth of material for spiritually inc=\r\nlined people there. The manuals on \n&gt; do-it-yourself homams are one of your=\r\n outstanding contributions to \n&gt; society, and shine brightly among the othe=\r\nr gems of your contributions. \n&gt; I feel an inclination towards performing h=\r\nomams on a daily/weekly basis. \n&gt; Before I start this, I want to seek your =\r\nguidance on the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Do I need to prepare myself in any way b=\r\nefore I start the homam?- I \n&gt; will explain to you what I mean here - since=\r\n you have suggested that one \n&gt; start with MahaGanapathi homam, I shall sta=\r\nrt with it too. However, as I \n&gt; have been worshipping DeviMa every morning=\r\n and Hanumanji every evening, \n&gt; do I need to start worshipping MahaGanapat=\r\nhi now for a few days during \n&gt; mornings and evenings and then after a few =\r\ndays, start with the homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Related to the first question, as I hav=\r\ne been worshipping DeviMa for \n&gt; quite sometime now, I see/visualize Her ma=\r\nny times during the day (at \n&gt; work/home), so now when I start with the Mah=\r\naGanapathi homam with \n&gt; complete faith, devotion, and surrender to MahaGan=\r\napathi, wouldn&#39;t there \n&gt; be a conflict in my mind, since I may still be vi=\r\nsualizing DeviMa \n&gt; everywhere around me (due to mind&#39;s conditioning), whil=\r\ne I am \n&gt; worshipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source, cradle an=\r\nd end \n&gt; of everything, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead? This m=\r\nay be \n&gt; a hypothetical situation, as I am talking about the future, howeve=\r\nr, may \n&gt; still be relevant, and so I seek your advice here.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. As I a=\r\nm householder, and we are expecting our first child in the next \n&gt; few mont=\r\nhs, is it ok to perform a homam at home? It may sound jouvenile \n&gt; but I do=\r\nn&#39;t know any better, and would rather listen to wiser men. The \n&gt; reason I =\r\nask this is that while doing the homam, we chant various \n&gt; mantras/stotras=\r\n, and they produce effects in the immediate environment, \n&gt; specially in th=\r\ne presence of Agni, the Pavaka. Although, the goal of my \n&gt; saadhana is to =\r\ndecondition my mimd to move towards greater purity, \n&gt; humility and peace, =\r\nand I have faith that a regular homam will enable me \n&gt; to achieve that. Ho=\r\nwever, for the sake of my wife and our child (inside \n&gt; her womb), I am pro=\r\nmpted to ask this question. Please don&#39;t take it in \n&gt; any other way except=\r\n as a genuine concern for my family (however silly \n&gt; it is)\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Relate=\r\nd to the above question, if it is fine for me to do the homam \n&gt; at home, t=\r\nhen can my pregnant wife also participate in it, if she wants \n&gt; to?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5=\r\n. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amavasya or an eclipse to \n&gt; =\r\nstart the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, should I do the homam at \n&gt;=\r\n a particular time every day or is any time fine? I do understand that \n&gt; d=\r\noing the homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, whatever time \n&gt; one=\r\n does it, is more beneficial than doing it at different times.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Is i=\r\nt better to do the homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as \n&gt; well? Th=\r\ne reason I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodation \n&gt; and the sm=\r\noke from the homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling. \n&gt; However, in ou=\r\nr residential/apartment complex, there is a common area, \n&gt; which is open o=\r\nn two sides, where some community festivals are \n&gt; celebrated together, and=\r\n if I get the permission, then maybe I can do \n&gt; the homam there? Is there =\r\na strong reason/added benefit to doing the \n&gt; homam at home?\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha=\r\nji, I will be very grateful to you for your answers to the \n&gt; above questio=\r\nns.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are rendering a great service to today&#39;s society and we pray t=\r\no \n&gt; DeviMa to keep showing you the way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for sharing so much=\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; Humble regards,\n&gt; Vipin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
