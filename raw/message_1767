Gita 9.22\n\nFor those constant yogis who worship with thou=\r\nghts centered only on Me, I Myself carry their yoga (necessities for susten=\r\nance) and (protect) their kshema (the necessities)&#2404;\nDevotees who are =\r\nalways connected to God in their thoughts, have to be really special. We ca=\r\nn understand that. But wait a minute here.. what is God saying? Is He promi=\r\nsing to haul groceries on His own back and deliver them to His devotees? An=\r\nd also, be their personal chowkidar?\nGod hauled groceries for Arjun Mishra.=\r\n That is the story I came to tell you today. His story is found in the Bhak=\r\ntamaal grantha.\n\nPundit Arjun Mishra lived with his wife in Puri, Orissa. I=\r\n do not know his exact time, but after talking with some informed people, g=\r\not the impression that they lived between 150-200 years ago. Puri is also k=\r\nnown as the Purushottam kshetra ( Land of Lord Purushottama Jagannatha ). T=\r\nhe famous Jagannatha temple is here. The ancient history of this holy place=\r\n is described in the Skanda Puran (Vishnu Khanda-Purushottam Mahatmyam).\n\nN=\r\now, back to the story=85 Arjun Mishra and his wife did not have much materi=\r\nal wealth. In fact, they were poorer than most poor. Like other Brahmins in=\r\n those days, he never showed any interest in making money. His life was for=\r\n studying the Gita and the Bhagavata. He was a great devotee and saw the wo=\r\nrld as Krishna-maya. That means, he saw Sri Krishna everywhere and in every=\r\nbody, pervading the universe. The world is seen that way by the exalted dev=\r\notees.\n\nAs you can imagine, such devotees are entirely unselfish. Arjun Mis=\r\nhra wanted to find a way to share his most valued wealth: his learning and =\r\nhis Spiritual experiences. What should he do?\n\n&quot;Well, the jagadgurus wrote =\r\ncommentaries on the Gita&quot; thought Arjun Mishra, &quot;I might just do that as we=\r\nll=85.I would certainly love to discuss those verses where I can mention my=\r\n own Spiritual experiences.&quot;\n\nHe was thinking about this verse\nyena bhutaan=\r\ni asheshhena drakshyasi aatmani atho mayi. 4.35\nBy which (Spiritual knowled=\r\nge) you will (initially) see all beings in your Atman and then (see all) in=\r\n Me.\n\nAnd this verse,\nVidya vinaya sampanne braahmane gavi hastini\nshuni ch=\r\na eva shvapaake cha panditaah samadarshanah. 5.18\nThe pundits see a wise an=\r\nd humble Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater to be equal (in=\r\n Spirit).\n\nAnd these verses,\nSamam sarveshu bhuteshu tishthantam parameshva=\r\nram. 13.27\nThe Parameshwar is equally present in all beings.\n\nYadaa bhuta p=\r\nrithagbhaavam ekastham anupashyati\nTata eva cha vistaaram brahma sampadyate=\r\n tadaa. 13.30\nWhen (someone) sees the beings of all different characteristi=\r\ncs to be one (in Spirit) and sees them to be expanded from That, then (that=\r\n person) attains the Brahman.\n\nSuch Spititual vision of the world has been =\r\ncalled sama-darshan (equal vision) in the Gita. Sri Krishna said that these=\r\n exalted devotees obtain paraa-bhakti (unwavering devotion) (18. 54). Arjun=\r\n Mishra was ready for it. Still, he had some lingering doubts.\n\n&quot;But=85 do =\r\nI really know enough to write about the whole Gita?&quot; he wondered. &quot;Well, le=\r\nt&#39;s look at it this way=85Arjuna heard the Gita from Sri Krishna Himself an=\r\nd saw His vishwarupa; yet sage Suta did not consider him a boddhaa (knower)=\r\n of the Gita, just someone who knows &quot;kinchit phalam&quot; (a bit of the benefit=\r\ns).\n\nkrishno janati vai samyak, kincit kunti-sutah phalam. Gita Mahatmya 3 =\r\n(Vaishnava tantra saara).\n\nSri Krishna certainly knows (the Gita), the son =\r\nof Kunti (Arjuna) knows a bit of its benefits.\n\nAnd again, acharya Madhva i=\r\nnitially thought that he could say about his commentary of the Gita that hi=\r\ns goal was to, &quot;bakshyaami shaktitah&quot; (describe as far as I can), but later=\r\n, he changed it to &quot;bakshyaami leshatah&quot; (describe, only be a tiny part of =\r\nthe teachings).&quot;\n\nIndeed, nobody can be wise enough to discuss every messag=\r\ne in the words of God. Those thoughts humbled Arjun Mishra very much. But t=\r\nhen, he wanted to write the commentary. So he reasoned, &quot;if I get stuck, I =\r\nwill ask Sri Krishna to help me out with the meaning and wait. I am not goi=\r\nng to rationalize, but just wait for Sri Krishna. May be Sri Krishna will h=\r\nave mercy on me, and teach me personally! Nothing can be more wonderful.&quot;\nH=\r\ne was doing fine with writing the commentary until he came to verse 9.22 (t=\r\nhat&#39;s the verse in the beginning of this story). A doubt came to his mind. =\r\nVahaamyaham? Can it really be true? God lugging provisions on His own back?=\r\n How can that be? He believed in God&#39;s words in the Gita, but just couldn&#39;t=\r\n accept that God can also be the porter for His devotees.\n\nHe had promised =\r\nto himself that he will not rationalize, but that&#39;s exactly what he started=\r\n doing. He reasoned, &quot;May be God means that He will arrange the delivery by=\r\n someone else.&quot;\n\nThinking so, he drew a line through the word vahaamyaham i=\r\nn his commentary with red ink. Isn&#39;t it interesting how we want God to conf=\r\norm to our model of Him? But the devotee in Arjun Mishra took over soon. He=\r\n remembered his vow about not rationalizing. He suddenly became very disapp=\r\nointed with himself. He stopped writing and got up, with a sad heart that h=\r\ne just broke his vow. What could he do? After a while, he got back some of =\r\nhis composure and said a prayer to Sri Krishna in all humility, &quot;Please tea=\r\nch me, O Madhava! I am ignorant and foolish and I do not know what you mean=\r\n by vahaamyaham. Please teach me, and guide me so the commentary can be com=\r\npleted. You give so much help to Your devotees. I know I am only a poor und=\r\neserving devotee, but please have mercy on me and help me.&quot;\n\nIt was already=\r\n mid-morning. His wife came to see him and said, &quot;We have no food today. Yo=\r\nu have been writing since morning. Please go to beg for alms, otherwise we =\r\nwill have to go hungry.&quot;\n\nArjun Mishra went out for the alms. In those days=\r\n, people considered it an honor to give food grains and vegetables to Brahm=\r\nins like him. Their begging is called maadhukari. Arjun Mishra was distraug=\r\nht from the morning, so he thought that he would go to take a dip in the ho=\r\nly Rohini kunda first. He set out from home, the kunda was a little distanc=\r\ne away.\n\nAs he was walking towards the kunda, he remembered the story of th=\r\ne old crow in the Skanda puran. When the crow realized that death was near,=\r\n it flew to the Rohini Kunda and took a bath in the water and then looked d=\r\nevotedly at Lord Jagannatha on the temple alter. Soon afterwards, it died a=\r\nnd became free from life. Arjun Mishra thought that taking a dip in such a =\r\nholy water will help him as well.\n\nWhile he was gone, two young boys arrive=\r\nd at the Mishra home with big sacks on their backs, huffing and puffing fro=\r\nm the load. They looked miserable and were crying loudly. Arjun Mishra&#39;s wi=\r\nfe was sitting on the verandah, looking out for her husband. When she saw t=\r\nhe boys, she came down the steps running, very concerned. She was an extrem=\r\nely kind lady.\n\n&quot;What happened to you, my children? Why are you crying? I c=\r\nannot understand who would hurt such young boys. Who is making you carry su=\r\nch heavy sacks? Where are you going?&quot;\n\nSaying so, she helped them unload th=\r\ne sacks. Then she had the shock of her life. She discovered deep lateral sc=\r\nars of fresh injury on their backs. Blood was oozing out from their scars. =\r\n&quot;Oh! What kind of heartless person can beat small children in this manner?&quot;=\r\n she exclaimed.\n\nShe picked the two boys up in her arms and brought them in=\r\nside the house&#2404; She sat them down on wooden seats they had in the ver=\r\nandah, and ran inside. There was no food in the house, so she brought two c=\r\nups of cold water for them. After drinking the water, the boys looked sligh=\r\ntly more comfortable. They said to her, &quot;Ma! Punditji beat us, and made us =\r\ncarry the grocery sacks. Those groceries are for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;My husband has bea=\r\nten you? But I have never known him to be angry&#2404; For what reason? Whe=\r\nn did he beat you? What did he beat you with?&quot; she almost collapsed in shoc=\r\nk.\n\n&quot;We do not know why, Ma&#2404; But he beat us with a sharp stick of iro=\r\nn&quot; they said&#2404; &quot;Just a little while ago&#2404;&quot;\n\nShe could not wait fo=\r\nr all the answers. She had to take care of their wounds first. She ran insi=\r\nde again, and came back with a big pot of water and some bandage cloth. The=\r\ny had a ghritakumari (aloe vera) plant in the yard; she ran to it and broke=\r\n a fat leaf. Then she mashed the leaf with her masala-grinding stone and co=\r\nllected the expressed resin. She was now ready to dress their wounds. She c=\r\nleaned their wounds, put a little of the ghritakumari extract and made a cl=\r\noth bandage. The ghritakumari resin soothed their wounds and the boys were =\r\nfeeling a lot better.\n\n&quot;Our friends are waiting for us for play. We want to=\r\n go, Ma&quot; they said. Then they bowed before her and left.\n\nArjun Mishra&#39;s wi=\r\nfe was happy that she could help them feel better. She also knew how little=\r\n boys are.. always short on patience. So, she hugged them and did not press=\r\n for more answers and let them go. Then her thoughts turned again to her hu=\r\nsband. She just did not understand how her gentle husband could have hurt t=\r\nhose boys. Anyway, she did not have time to think too much. She needed to s=\r\ntart cooking. So she picked up the groceries and started cooking. Her husba=\r\nnd should come back any time now.\n\nArjun Mishra had taken the vow of three-=\r\nhouse maadhukari. He would only go to three houses and accept one handful o=\r\nf rice and some vegetables from each house. It had rained heavily the night=\r\n before and it rained all morning. The three houses he went to, were all fl=\r\nooded. He called out, but nobody was home. People had left for higher groun=\r\nd. So he came back home empty-handed. When he got home, he found his wife w=\r\nas cooking something. He thought that somebody must have brought some food =\r\nfor them.\n\nHe announced, &quot;My love, the rains have flooded a lot of houses. =\r\nNobody was there to give me alms today. But I see you are cooking, who brou=\r\nght us food?&quot;\n\nHis wife was crying, &quot;How could you beat those two little bo=\r\nys?&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean? I beat two boys? I didn&#39;t beat any boys.&quot; He excla=\r\nimed.\n\n&quot;You didn&#39;t beat them?&quot; She said in disbelief.\n\n&quot;Why should I beat a=\r\nnybody? You saw what I was doing since morning. I was writing about the Git=\r\na. Then I went to the Rohini kunda and took a bath. Then I went for maadhuk=\r\nari. From there, I came straight back home. I did not see any boys.&quot; He sai=\r\nd in defense.\n\n&quot;You did beat them. They told me how you beat them with a sh=\r\narp stick of iron. They had scars across their backs, and were bleeding. I =\r\ntreated them with ghritakumari myself. &quot; She said.\n\n&quot;I did not beat anybody=\r\n. I didn&#39;t. Why should I lie to you?&quot; he insisted.\n\n&quot;Making them carry thos=\r\ne heavy sacks was bad enough. What did they do that you beat them with a sh=\r\narp iron stick?&quot; She grumbled, clearly not believing her husband.\n\n&quot;I do no=\r\nt know what you are talking about.&quot; Arjun Mishra retorted. He went inside t=\r\no the room where he was writing in the morning. He was about to sit down, b=\r\nut his wife followed him there.\n\n&quot;Come now and eat. I have much work to do.=\r\n I have to clean after you.&quot; She said.\n\n&quot;All right, I am coming. But I am v=\r\nery unhappy that you do not believe me.&quot; He said.\nArjun Mishra followed her=\r\n and sat down to eat. &quot;I do not understand how the day is going. First, I g=\r\net stuck with a verse. Then I do not get any maadhukari. Then you say that =\r\nI beat up two young boys.&quot; He mumbled. &quot;Who brought us the food?&quot;\n\n&quot;Those t=\r\nwo boys, who else? You had sent them with the food, they told me.&quot; She said=\r\n.\n\n&quot;I sent two boys with food? I did not do any such thing. Are you sure th=\r\ney brought the food for us?&quot; He asked.\n\n&quot;They said your name. And said that=\r\n you made them carry the sacks of food and bring to me.&quot; She said, &quot;Eat now=\r\n. I have work to do.&quot;\n\n&quot;Whose children are they? Do you know them?&quot; he aske=\r\nd.\n\n&quot;No. I do not. They are not from our village.&quot; She said.\n\n&quot;Not from our=\r\n village? What did they look like?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;They were cute little boys.=\r\n The younger one was dark and the older one was fair.&quot; She said.\n\nArjun Mis=\r\nhra did not need any more clues. He immediately realized who the two boys w=\r\nere: they were Sri Krishna and Balarama. In the morning, he had doubted tha=\r\nt Sri Krishna will personally carry provisions for his devotees. To show hi=\r\nm that He does, He carried a sack of groceries on His back. He even made Sr=\r\ni Balarama carry a second sack for them for another meal. And, he struck ou=\r\nt the word vahaamyaham with red ink. That mark Sri Krishna carried as injur=\r\ny.\n\nArjun Mishra could eat no more. He was chocking with emotion. He had pi=\r\ncked up a morsel, but he put that on his head and sat there in silence. Tea=\r\nrs streamed out from his eyes.\n\nHis wife was perplexed. &quot;What happened?&quot;\n\n&quot;=\r\nMy love, this is no mere food, this is prasad. Those boys were Sri Krishna =\r\nand Balarama. You are so fortunate that you saw them. Eat some of the prasa=\r\nd yourself and let&#39;s go out to fetch everybody in the village. This we shou=\r\nld share with everyone.&quot; He said excitedly.Then he explained to her what ha=\r\nd happened since morning.\n\nShe ate some prasad excitedly. After that, they =\r\nhad a big celebration with the neighbors sharing the prasad. There were lot=\r\ns of Harinam singing and ecstatic dancing. After everyone had gone home, Ar=\r\njun Mishra went to his writing room. He wrote: vahaamyaham, vahaamyaham, va=\r\nhaamyaham. He was convinced of God&#39;s promise to His devotees.\n\nArjun Mishra=\r\n wrote an excellent commentary of the Gita with real Spiritual insights. Hi=\r\ns commentary is famous for the triple mention of vahaamyaham. The message o=\r\nf this story is that we should never seek an imaginary relationship with Go=\r\nd and trust God to personally help us, teach us and at the end, liberate us=\r\n. If we do not have that confidence, we are not worthy of being called devo=\r\ntees.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
