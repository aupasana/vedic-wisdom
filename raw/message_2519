But that is not enough. In addition, there are many \nrequirements on what to put in poornaahuti, what materials to offer, what \nmaterials to offer in bali, what muhurta to use etc. Material results \nrequire some material constraints.\n\nIt is my well-considered view that there aren&#39;t too many people who can \nensure specific results by doing a homam. Moreover, the knowledge needed for \nthose, of which what you mention below is only a small part, is lost. \nHowever, if some people are going to come in future who will demonstrate the \npower of homam even for material results of a big scale, all such knowledge \nwill be revealed again, in time.\n\nI only teach homam to those who want to purify their thinking and make \nspiritual progress. When homam is used for that purpose, all those rules are \ninapplicable. You can do any day and any time. However, for several homams, \nlate night is inappropriate. Morning is the best, evening time (+/- 2 hours \nfrom sunset) is also very good and the rest of the day is ok.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;puneetrph&quot; &lt;puneetrph@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, September 12, 2009 11:42 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] is Muhurat required for homam?\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; In some books they outline agni chakra, and they also indicate that homam \n&gt; done on certain days is good i.e. if the fire resides on earth. But if the \n&gt; fire of the havan resides is in heaven (loss of life) or patal loka (loss \n&gt; of wealth). Should we be concerned with this or can we go about doing \n&gt; homam at any day and time?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Puneet\n\n\n"}}
