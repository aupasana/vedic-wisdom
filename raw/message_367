Let me expand=\r\n now. Though this is not related to the original questions, this will compl=\r\nete the story.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere was a way to the sea through a=\r\n country called &quot;Vishnu raajyam&quot; [Vaishnavism]. Some people travelled the p=\r\nath, found a beautiful city called Vishnupuri on the coast and the sea was =\r\nclose to the city. The journey through Vishnu raajya was documented in a bo=\r\nok [Vishnu Purana] and the book claimed that this was a beautiful journey a=\r\nnd enables one to reach the sea. It also claimed that other coastal cities =\r\nwere by the very same sea and reaching the sea here amounts to reaching the=\r\n sea at all other places.\n \nThere was another way to the sea through a coun=\r\ntry called &quot;Shiva desam&quot; [Shaivism]. Some people travelled the path, found =\r\na wonderful city called Shivanagari on the coast and the sea was right next=\r\n to it. The journey though Shiva desam was documented in a book [Shiva Pura=\r\nna] and the book claimed that this was an amazing journey and enables one t=\r\no reach the sea. It also claimed that other coastal cities were by the very=\r\n same sea and reaching the sea here amounts to reaching the sea at all othe=\r\nr places.\n \nThere were some people who had never actually been to either ci=\r\nty nor seen the sea. Some were impressed by the description of one city and=\r\n some by the other. They were so impressed that they started arguing which =\r\nwas the best city. Some even went to the extent of condemning and putting d=\r\nown the other city. Some people who had seen both the cities came forward a=\r\nnd said, &quot;the main thing is not the city, but the sea itself. The sea is th=\r\ne same in both places. Though different, both cities are nice and both give=\r\n one the same sea.&quot; That did not convince the fighting factions and they co=\r\nntinued to fight. Later, some of them even forgot about the sea and started=\r\n thinking that the city was the main thing and not the sea. Of course, both=\r\n the cities are really beautiful. Stuck in their animosity and fights, they=\r\n could never visit either city nor enjoy the sea.\n \n*        *        *\n \nO=\r\nK, I think the parable is complete now. :-)\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n  ----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \n  From: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com ; sivacharya@yahoogroups.com ; sohamsa@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monda=\r\ny, August 18, 2008 12:43 AM\n  Subject: Analogy: Veda, Aagama, Tantra, Aghor=\r\na etc\n\n\n  Namaste Sir,\n\n  There is no need for either Sri or Ji in addressi=\r\nng me.\n\n  Hoping you won&#39;t mind, I am sending this reply to some yahoogroup=\r\ns that may have some interested people. When I was meditating before replyi=\r\nng to you, a really beautiful and meaningful analogy came to me and I think=\r\n it is worth sharing with more people than just you. To ensure your anonymi=\r\nty, I removed references in the quoted mail below that may help one identif=\r\ny you.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  First I will answer your first question in=\r\n detail, because that can automatically answer other questions.\n\n  &gt; 1. Are=\r\n Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras\n  &gt; (people e=\r\nxplain that mantra shastra does not originate from the vedas,\n  &gt; but class=\r\nified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?\n\n  *    =\r\n    *        *\n\n  When people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly=\r\n I can only laugh. They are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with per=\r\nfect swara or mastering a celebrated commentary does not help one understan=\r\nd Veda. In fact, understanding each single verse in Veda requires great tap=\r\nascharya. Understanding a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flo=\r\nwing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It i=\r\ns possible only with energy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with n=\r\neither intuition nor logic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the =\r\nlack of a better expression, direct knowledge.\n\n  When one meditates long e=\r\nnough on a verse, the verse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the=\r\n only way to understand a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible =\r\nto decipher even a single verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.\n\n  =\r\nBottomoline is: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are considered &quot;=\r\npure vaidika rituals&quot; are merely another variety of rituals created by some=\r\none at some point of time. From the point of view of authenticity as grante=\r\nd by Veda, there is no difference between them and other aagamic rituals, t=\r\nhough people ignorantly believe otherwise.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  A simp=\r\nle analogy may help clarify a lot of things related to this complicated iss=\r\nue a little. What the thing in the analogy represents is shown here and the=\r\nre in square brackets [].\n\n  Once there were many people who lived near the=\r\n sea [Brahman/Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight =\r\nand sound of the sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some =\r\nnice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\n  As people started living a little away from t=\r\nhe sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruc=\r\ntions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the=\r\n instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [=\r\nrituals].\n\n  People started moving further and further inland and started l=\r\niving in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had nev=\r\ner seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perfo=\r\nrmed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated=\r\n endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and=\r\n formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, fo=\r\nund a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfi=\r\ned that that was sea!\n\n  Then came some great person, whose instincts led h=\r\nim to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use =\r\nof other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together ne=\r\nwer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagam=\r\nas].\n\n  People performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but th=\r\nen this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path a=\r\nnd different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic ritual]. By now, peo=\r\nple did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of=\r\n sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot;=\r\n sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the =\r\noriginal instructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the n=\r\newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where=\r\n they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n\n  Slowly many =\r\nnew sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and man=\r\ny new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to =\r\nwalk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].\n\n  One particular p=\r\nath through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths invo=\r\nlving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much=\r\n shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the braves=\r\nt and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [c=\r\nhance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea v=\r\nia that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well cam=\r\ne forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path=\r\n. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully make it in=\r\n that path desisted from it.\n\n  As time progressed, people started fighting=\r\n too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enoug=\r\nh to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea pa=\r\nth or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geograp=\r\nhy and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblock=\r\ns and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was=\r\n the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were suppose=\r\nd to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to t=\r\nhe changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned those who a=\r\nctually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place =\r\nand time, for violating tradition.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  In case the an=\r\nalogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about re=\r\nalizing self. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realizati=\r\non. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjec=\r\nts throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive =\r\nstatements can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no d=\r\nefinitive statements can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on on=\r\ne&#39;s current position!\n\n  Great men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism=\r\n as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the cur=\r\nrent state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to r=\r\neach that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and =\r\nexperienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions b=\r\netween paths.\n\n  Please re-read the story and try to understand what each p=\r\nart of the story represents. If you understand this analogy well, this can =\r\nreally clarify the meaningless nature of so many debates that people waste =\r\ntime with!\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sr=\r\ni Adi Sankara has condemned\n  &gt; Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read=\r\n that he is a great Sri Vidya\n  &gt; Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roo=\r\nts from Tantra, what did\n  &gt; Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n\n  He did condemn so=\r\nme vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like the use of sex, alcoho=\r\nl, meat etc.\n\n  However, please go back to my analogy. A great man may cond=\r\nemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has a lot of wild animal=\r\ns and dacoits and many travellers through that path recently lost their liv=\r\nes. It does not mean that path is totally unusable. It only means that too =\r\nmany people incapable of travelling on that path are using it of late and s=\r\no the great man was compelled to stop the practice.\n\n  If the same great ma=\r\nn is reincarnated at a different time when several adept souls he has a rin=\r\na with are about to be reincarnated, he may not condemn the path and instea=\r\nd write on travelling that jungle path carefully!\n\n  The words of great mas=\r\nters need to be interpreted within the context of their desa, kaala and paa=\r\ntra and within the context of the purpose of that particular birth.\n\n  *   =\r\n     *        *\n\n  &gt; 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - =\r\nsex, drinks etc,\n  &gt; why must it be practiced at all?\n\n  Suppose one&#39;s hous=\r\ne is close to the market and the market noise reaches one&#39;s house. Suppose =\r\nthat noise is disturbing one&#39;s meditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on g=\r\nod amid all the noise. There are two approaches one can take - (1) run away=\r\n from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to t=\r\nhe challenge, meditate right there and develop the ability to turn off the =\r\nsensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of th=\r\ne mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturbance. After all, the no=\r\nise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is the *inability* of one=\r\n&#39;s mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling one&#39;s mind, one can =\r\nfocus attention on god irrespective of what is happening outside.\n\n  Approa=\r\nch (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent chance of failure=\r\n with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile.=\r\n But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with approach (2), it is gre=\r\nat. It hastens one&#39;s progress.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  Vaamaachaara is al=\r\nso like that, but a more extreme form of testing one&#39;s self-control by risi=\r\nng to the challenge.\n\n  Please realize that vaamaachaara/aghora is not abou=\r\nt the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about their use to tes=\r\nt oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one&#39;s self-control. Self-re=\r\nalization comes when self-control is perfect and one&#39;s mind can always be f=\r\nocussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If one is either attr=\r\nacted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block self-realization.=\r\n\n\n  However, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from vaamaachaara. O=\r\nne needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a really pure yog=\r\ni with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with all his mind even =\r\nwhen he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly emb=\r\nracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control and hone it. But,=\r\n if that is going to tempt one, get the mind away from god and onto a physi=\r\ncal enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as one who does not =\r\nhave a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and h=\r\none one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the foc=\r\nus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as wine, meat =\r\nand sex should stay away from those.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  In my analog=\r\ny before, the short jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animal=\r\ns and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having=\r\n the wherewithal to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that=\r\n path, one may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using t=\r\nhis path will fall if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes =\r\nthis path because it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is =\r\nonly for the fittest and bravest.\n\n  If there is ANY weakness in one&#39;s self=\r\n-control, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from t=\r\nhe desert to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realizatio=\r\nn. One should follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous=\r\n samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; Is it not=\r\n a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? \n\n  :-) Sri Ambal (the Divine =\r\nMother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere! All know=\r\nledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own different mani=\r\nfestations.\n\n  If a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and sits nak=\r\ned with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keeps his min=\r\nd fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are all differe=\r\nnt manifestations of the Divine Mother only.\n\n  As a matter of fact, even i=\r\nf one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his desires =\r\nand actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Mo=\r\nther gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains of respo=\r\nnsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She t=\r\nakes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are=\r\n actually Her manifestations only.\n\n  However, those who are more comfortab=\r\nle with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will l=\r\nook at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain in=\r\n duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reality is=\r\n that She is All.\n\n  I need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a=\r\n few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yahoogrou=\r\nps or to me privately.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Narasimha\n  ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n  Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n  Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n  Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\n  Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n  -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n\n    Sri Sri Naras=\r\nimhaJI\n    Namaskarams.

(2) rise to the challenge, meditate right=\r\n there \n  and develop the ability to turn off the sensory input to the mind=\r\n, i.e. get \n  mastery and control over the part of the mind that is making =\r\none vulnerable to \n  this disturbance.

It is about their use to \n  test oneself with the toughest challenges a=\r\nnd hone one&#39;s self-control. \n  Self-realization comes when self-control is =\r\nperfect and one&#39;s mind can always \n  be focussed on god no matter what is g=\r\noing on around one. If one is either \n  attracted or averse to any one thin=\r\ng, that is enough to block \n  self-realization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;However, if one is weak, it is better to stay \n  away from vaamaachaara.

If a really pure =\r\nyogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on \n  god with all his mind=\r\n even when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful \n  naked woman ti=\r\nghtly embracing him, then he can try that to test his \n  self-control and h=\r\none it. But, if that is going to&nbsp;tempt one, get the \n  mind away from =\r\ngod and onto a physical enjoyment, then one better not try that \n  path! Ju=\r\nst as one who does not have a strong mind to meditate amid noise \n  should =\r\nmeditate in solitude and hone one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have \n  =\r\na strong mind to keep the focus on god in the middle of normally depriving =\r\n\n  practices such as wine, meat and sex should stay away from those.&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n=\r\n  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;In my analogy before, the short jungle path to \n  the sea having the dange=\r\nr of wild animals and dacoits represents the \n  vaamaachaara path of aghora=\r\n.
