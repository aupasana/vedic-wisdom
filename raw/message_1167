Starting off with Ganapathi \nHomam is defin=\r\nitely better. The procedure is short and it helps one \npractice the fire ma=\r\nnagement, the mantras, the swaras and the whole \nnine yards. Moreover, the =\r\nChandi Homam Manual by itself is not self-\nsufficient. It relies on Ganapat=\r\nhi Homam manual. So, you have to go \nback and forth between the 2 manuals t=\r\no perform Chandi Homam which \ncan be done but gets little bit tricky in the=\r\n beginning. So, get \ncomfortable with the Ganapathi Homam procedure.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 After you feel comfortable with the=\r\n Ganapathi Homam \nprocedure, while continuing to do Ganapathi Homam daily, =\r\nyou can \nactually do Chandi Homam occasionally on certain days say weekends=\r\n, \nor on Ashtami, Navami and Chaturdasi which are especially auspicious \nfo=\r\nr Chandipath/Chandi Homam. When doing Chandi Homam, you can skip \nyour Gana=\r\npathi Homam for that day. After doing this for few months \nor when you feel=\r\n you are comfortable with the Chandi Homam, finally \nsettle down with it.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 It&#39;s getting close to an year s=\r\nince I did my first \nChandi Homam and Narasimhaji was with me, guiding me w=\r\nith fire \nmanagement and helping me with the copra pieces, correcting my \np=\r\nronunciation and all. I used to do it over weekends, which for me \nwas taki=\r\nng about 3- 3 1/2hrs initially, owing to my poor Telugu \nreading skills. Th=\r\nen, slowly switched to daily after the whole \nprocess started taking about =\r\n2 hrs. While still, I am not perfect, I \ncontinue to practice. On this note=\r\n, I am reminded of Narayan.\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Th=\r\ne idea of writing a Maha Ganapathi Homam manual \nstarted off as Narayan ask=\r\ned Narasimha to help him out with the \nHomam Procedure. (Narayan&#39;s own insp=\r\niring message in this regard can \nbe read at http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- wisdom/message/ \n727). After the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji =\r\nemailed the first \ncopy to Narayan. Such was Narayan&#39;s dedication that he s=\r\ntarted going \nthrough the manual over and over. A few days later I met Nara=\r\nyan and \nenquired about the Homam manual and all. He very casually mentione=\r\nd \nthat he was doing the Homam mentally. I was dumbstruck. I \nsaid &quot;What?&quot;.=\r\n He said he would perform the whole procedure as \nmentioned in the document=\r\n, IN MIND. Imagining taking the vow, \nimagining Agni pratishtapana, imagini=\r\nng invoking Ganesha, imagining \noffering ahutis, everything, start to finis=\r\nh in mind. I was really \nbowled over by his creative thinking. That is how =\r\nNarayan practiced. \nLater, Narasimhaji gifted us Homa Kundam and\n&gt;  we star=\r\nted our Homas. After few months passed by and I had to go \non couple of tri=\r\nps where I could not carry my Homa Kundam and all \nthe samagri. I implement=\r\ned Narayan&#39;s idea and did my homam mentally \nfor those few days. It then he=\r\nlped me avoid that feeling that I \nmissed my homam. Though this process is =\r\nnot a replacement for the \nHomam with all the physical materials, yet, it i=\r\ns a form of a prayer \nto God. Something is better than nothing.\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Naliniji, She has already decided when yo=\r\nu would \nstart the Homam, it&#39;s just that we have not been informed yet. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I wish you all the very best.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Ravi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; Fro=\r\nm: Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@ gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 10, 2009 3:50:36 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Regarding Homam video and Narasimhaji -\n My Master\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; |om|\n&gt; De=\r\nar Nalini, namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ...thought I should probably start with Ganap=\r\nati Homam \nand=C2=A0wondered if I also start Chandi homam...=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; {Hari} I also had similar thoughts like you but I think that \nstartin=\r\ng with Ganesha homam is better and then one can &#39;graduate&#39; to \nChandi homam=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Sadly, when I enquired locally (New Zealand) at the Indian =\r\nshops I \ncould not find Homa Kundam...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; {Hari} Why not try to pur=\r\nchase it from rediff.com?
