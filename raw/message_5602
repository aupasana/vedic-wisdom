It represents ParaBrahma. Other beejas like those=\r\n in navarna mantra are saguna beejas and they represent combinations of spe=\r\ncific qualities. Adding Om at the beginning of a mantra is like thinking of=\r\n ParaBrahma and then thinking of a specific deity or form in relation to Pa=\r\nraBrahma. In tradition, Om is invariably added at the beginning of every ma=\r\nntra, if it is not already there.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you think of a specific form s=\r\nuch as Mahakali or Sri Rama or Narasimha or Saraswati or Tara or Dakshinamu=\r\nrthy etc, it is possible to see them as forms representing certain qualitie=\r\ns or as forms emanating from ParaBrahma and representing certain qualities.=\r\n Thinking of ParaBrahma will keep the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;, which i=\r\ns the corner stone of Self-knowledge, as a part of one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Som=\r\ne people actually consider it &quot;risky&quot; to do mantras starting with other bee=\r\njas and add Om. This is basically like making Self-knowledge the fundamenta=\r\nl goal of sadhana and remembering it always, so that you do not risk gettin=\r\ng swayed by other goals (like specific abilities, siddhis etc).\n&gt;  \n&gt; As fo=\r\nr navarna mantra, one can do it with or without Om. Both are fine. But do p=\r\nonder on the above and do what you find appropriate. Both are meaningful an=\r\nd both affect one&#39;s consciousness positively.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;               =\r\n    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, gopal narayan &lt;gopalnarayan123@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; jai gurudev\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; om shivgoraksh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if u add om i=\r\nt becomes dashakshari [ 10 letters ].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; without om its navarna mantr=\r\na [ 9 letter ]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; om shakti\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; gopal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jan 6, 20=\r\n11 at 1:18 PM, Gaurav Kapur &lt;groovyacharya@&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narashi=\r\nmhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a query regarding the Navarna Mantra in chandi pat=\r\nh.
