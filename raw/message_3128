I will answer the second one to the list without revealing your details.\n \nIf a yogi doing sadhana and accumulating shakti is attached to the body, then body will flourish. However, such a yogi cannot go beyond a limit.\n \nIf a yogi doing sadhana and accumulating shakti is not attached to the body, then body may or may not be in a good shape. Please remember that body awareness and attachment to the body and its well-being are a major obstacle in self-realiztion.\n \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa had throat cancer. It was so painful that he could not even swallow food. Yet, he chose to suffer.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSuppose you have a computer using which you are supposed to develop a particular software for the benefit of the world. Let us say that is your duty or dharma. If the computer breaks down, you will fail in your dharma. So you should do enough to make sure that the computer remains in working condition. You should install proper anti-virus software on that computer and take other precautions so that it serves your purpose. But, if you are so pre-occupied with the well-being of the computer that you spend all your time running virus scans, spyware and adware scans, registry optimizations, installation and testing of new anti-virus programs, anti-spyware programs etc, creating a nice desktop, screen saver etc for the computer and so on, you will not get enough time actually do your main duty. After all, computer is just an instrument to enable you to fulfil your duty.\n \nThis body is like that computer. It is just an instrument to help one fulfil one&#39;s dharma, i.e. pay back one&#39;s karmic debts towards individuals, groups and universe at large. One should do enough to keep it in the required shape so that it enables one to do what one sees as one&#39;s dharma. But one should not not think about it excessively.\n \nIf stopping the fall of hair is somehow important for fulfilling one&#39;s duty to the world, then one may do something about it. Otherwise, how does it matter?\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Please answer few of my queries when you have time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW,this one is of less importance , you may leave it if you have some other work.\n&gt; 2)Shouldn&#39;t by doing our sadhana our body also become more healthy.But of late i have seen a lot of hair fall on my body.Is this has something to do with my sadhana.\n&gt; i have seeen your video and even you have lost some hair and i have studied that it can be stopped through yogic exercises.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the question is, you being such knowledgeable person have not tried it or what.The only reason i have not tred it is because sirshana and sarvanga asana are recommended for it and it comes under Rajyoga which is dificult to follw. Your comments.\n&gt; \n&gt; i remember vimalanda has at once place said that in kaliyug wwe are too attached to our bodies, but i am still unable to help thinking about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n\n\n"}}
