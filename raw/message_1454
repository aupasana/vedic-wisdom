Some of the results have been unbelievable but have to be acknowledged=\r\n, being first hand witness!\n\nFurther, it is also realised that the greater =\r\nthe surrender and faith, the faster and more intense the results.\n\nIt has b=\r\neen my personal observation that the morning recitations (while SUN is in t=\r\nhe sky) increase benefic results and the evening recitations (During or aft=\r\ner Sandhya) reduce the malefic effects,  increase mental peace for even tho=\r\nse who just listen the recitations. It is marvelous for spiritual growth.\n\n=\r\nI have never done or advised homam for Shri Vishnu Sahasranam but regularly=\r\n use (and advise too) a Deepak or incense sticks being kept lit during the =\r\nrecitation period.\nthanks for the homam idea,\nBest regards,\nHimanshu Mohan\n=\r\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Anybody who told you to stop reading Vishnu sahasrana=\r\nam because it gave \n&gt; certain undesirable results has no idea whatsoever. R=\r\neading Vishnu&#39;s 1000 \n&gt; names can NEVER harm you. NEVER. It may increase go=\r\nod results or decrease \n&gt; bad results, but never increase bad results.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Secondly, the symptoms you are describing sound a lot like some movement o=\r\nf \n&gt; praana (life force) in some of the upper chakras. This is not a bad th=\r\ning at \n&gt; all. If some other pieces of the puzzle fall in place, this can a=\r\nctually \n&gt; help your spiritual progress considerably.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of telli=\r\nng you to stop Vishnu sahasranaam, I will suggest increasing \n&gt; the number =\r\nof times you read it. If you spend an hour in the morning and an \n&gt; hour in=\r\n the evening, it will be awesome.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, if it is possible, doing a =\r\nhomam every morning with Vishnu \n&gt; sahasranaam will accelerate the progress=\r\n. I will have to soon put together a \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;ha=\r\nrikishan1962&quot; &lt;harikishan1962@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nent: Thursday, March 05, 2009 11:52 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Is reading=\r\n Vishnushaharanamas Thries a day will \n&gt; Reduce our Past Life Karma?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaskaram GuRU NARASIMHA GARU,\n&gt; &gt;           I had a Health Problem wh=\r\nich doctors do not identify. While \n&gt; &gt; watching TV i hard that Sri VishnuS=\r\nahsranams will reduce the Past Life \n&gt; &gt; Karma along  with Present Life Pro=\r\nblems. From past 10 Years i am reading \n&gt; &gt; Sri VishnuSahsranamas regularly=\r\n. Three Years ago i noticed some kind of \n&gt; &gt; pinning on Centre of my Head,=\r\n i asked  so many people about this. every \n&gt; &gt; body says their own opinion=\r\n, i continued Reading Sahasranamas just \n&gt; &gt; depending on VISHNU, Now i hav=\r\ne simulations in between EYEBROWS and on the \n&gt; &gt; TOP OF NOSE, when i went =\r\nin to prayer there are lot of movements in my \n&gt; &gt; Head like a ANT or some =\r\nsmall FLY  moving above the ear to forehead from \n&gt; &gt; both sides AND THE PI=\r\nNNING IS THROUHG OUT DAY and  now a days i am hearing \n&gt; &gt; non stop sound l=\r\nike &quot;wueeeeeeeeee&quot;, in my ears.Few days ago i asked Master \n&gt; &gt; CVV discipl=\r\ne about this, he said that &quot;Stop Reading Sahasranamas, but my \n&gt; &gt; will is =\r\nnot accept.
