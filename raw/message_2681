I\n&gt; sincerely prayed during the Homam conclusion to be forgiven for all the\n&gt; mistakes commited during the homam..\n&gt;\n&gt; 2nd Homam: This time I was very relaxed and took my owm time to make sure\n&gt; that I dont make any mistakes.. the homam fire burnt peacefully and I did\n&gt; not hurt myself..I was told by my wife that the room was full of smoke which\n&gt; made breathing difficult and we even had couple of neighbours at our\n&gt; doorsteps enquiring about the smoke.
