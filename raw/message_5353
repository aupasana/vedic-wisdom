A few quick comments.\n\n(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemic=\r\nals in our body and their \ninteractions, are controlled by what we eat. Thu=\r\ns, what we eat has a profound \nimpact on us.\n\n(2) Much has been written on =\r\nthe material benefits from vegetarianism. But that \nis not all. There are s=\r\npiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n\nEating the flesh or body parts of an =\r\nanimal that strongly identifies with the \nphysical body entails a karma. Se=\r\nlf-identification of plants with their physical \nbody is much subtler and t=\r\nhe karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \nsmaller.\n\nEspecially=\r\n these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by \ncorporatio=\r\nns and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their \nsuffe=\r\nring goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n\n(3) I heard an interview=\r\n with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several \nmonths back. They=\r\n conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \nfed with mea=\r\nt. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \nmonths, rese=\r\narchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \nfed with=\r\n meat were duller.\n\nTheir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more e=\r\nnergy. Gorillas fed with \nnuts and fruits may have diverted more energy tow=\r\nards the development of brain. \nThough they were not sure if the same thing=\r\n applies to human beings or not, a \nbalanced vegetarian diet perhaps can ma=\r\nximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n\n(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we m=\r\nay feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well \non work that requires alertne=\r\nss and skill. That is because the digestive process \nis using up a lot of e=\r\nnergy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \nagni available for=\r\n other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \nhappens in =\r\nthe mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \nrequire=\r\ns agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after \n=\r\na heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before=\r\n \neating.\n\n(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, =\r\ndeep fried food \nwith more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni e=\r\ntc) are consumed more \nfrequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more =\r\noften and there is less agni \navailable for assimilaring intellectual and s=\r\npiritual ideas and experiences. If \none eats saattwik food that is very eas=\r\ny to digest (simple grains, simple \nlentils and simple vegetables, all soft=\r\nly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), \nless agni is diverted towards dig=\r\nestion and more agni is available for \nassimilaring intellectual and spirit=\r\nual ideas and experiences.\n\n(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well.=\r\n But huge stacks of dry grass may \nbe burnt by just one spark! Similarly, l=\r\nittle bit of internal fire may be enough \nto assimilate spiritual ideas and=\r\n experiences in a person with excellent \nvaasanas and few obstructions (dry=\r\n grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \nin a person with poor vaasan=\r\nas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all \ndepends on vaasanas and=\r\n impurities in nadis and chakras.\n\nOne person may eat meat and deep fried f=\r\noods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \nthem and yet make excellent spiritu=\r\nal progress. Another person may eat saattwik \nfood, maximize the agni avail=\r\nable for spiritual transformation and yet struggle \nto progress spiritually=\r\n. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore \ncounter-examples=\r\n and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that \nmaximizes the agn=\r\ni available for spiritual progress.\n\n(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animal=\r\ns have their own vaasanas and their needs. \nIf an animal can survive on veg=\r\netarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \nfellow whatever he/she needs.=\r\n\n\n(8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume eno=\r\nugh \nfood to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the mat=\r\nerial \nworld using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too mu=\r\nch food is \nnot good for spiritual sadhana.\n\nInstead of overeating most of =\r\nthe time and fasting on specific days, it is \nbetter to eat limited amount =\r\nalways. Regular practices are more important for \ntransformation and succes=\r\ns, than occasional practices.\n\n(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer =\r\nof all actions or considering food \nto be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape t=\r\nhe karma involved. It depends on how \ndeeply ingrained that thought is and =\r\nhow deeply one feels so. If one internally \nfeels 100% that god is acting t=\r\nhrough one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \neating) is just god&#39;s prasad to=\r\n one, then one is free.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFilms.org \nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-365714899-1291239273=:47105\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:18pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;Namaste Narasimha,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;I disgree with t=\r\nwo points you mentioned.

A few quick comments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) We are we we eat. Production o=\r\nf various chemicals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by w=\r\nhat we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) Much =\r\nhas been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is n=\r\not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eating the f=\r\nlesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the physical =\r\nbody entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical bod=\r\ny is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is muc=\r\nh smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for me=\r\nat production by corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of=\r\n the karma for their suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public R=\r\nadio)\n several months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One s=\r\net of gorillas was fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits e=\r\ntc. After several months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of th=\r\ne two sets. The ones fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Their theory was tha=\r\nt digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits=\r\n may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain. Though the=\r\ny were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a balance=\r\nd vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot foc=\r\nus well on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the dige=\r\nstive process is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and =\r\nthere isn&#39;t much agni available for other activities such as digestion of i=\r\nntellectual ideas that happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of\n spirit=\r\nual ideas/experiences also requires agni and that cannot happen well. That =\r\nis why meditation or homam after a heavy meal are fruitless and we are norm=\r\nally advised to do sadhana before eating.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(5) If foods that light up=\r\n a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with more oil, spicy =\r\nfoods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more frequently, agni=\r\n is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni available =\r\nfor assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If one e=\r\nats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple lentil=\r\ns and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), l=\r\ness agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is available for assim=\r\nilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(6) Even a=\r\n big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may be b=\r\nurnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal\n fire may be enou=\r\ngh to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent=\r\n vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be n=\r\needed in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thu=\r\ns, it all depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O=\r\nne person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesti=\r\nng them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat s=\r\naattwik food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and =\r\nyet struggle to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action fo=\r\nr one is to ignore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things b=\r\neing equal, that maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their=\r\n needs. If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed =\r\nthe poor fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(8)\n One should eat to live a=\r\nnd not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so=\r\n that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material world using physical body=\r\n and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritua=\r\nl sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on spe=\r\ncific days, it is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices ar=\r\ne more important for transformation and success, than occasional practices.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or consi=\r\ndering food to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It de=\r\npends on how deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. =\r\nIf one internally feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever on=\r\ne is doing (e.g. eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;-----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software,\n Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish =\r\nWritings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;
