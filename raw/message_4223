But in our dreams we make no con=\r\nscious effort to get\nrid of the dream and to awake, but the dream itself co=\r\nmes to an end without\nany effort on our part and we become awake. Similarly=\r\n why should not the\nwaking state, which is in reality only another sort of =\r\ndream, come to an end\nof its own accord, and without any effort on our part=\r\n, and land us in jnana\nor real awakening?\n\nBhagavan: Your thinking that you=\r\n have to make an effort to get rid of this\ndream of the waking state and yo=\r\nur making efforts to attain jnana or real\nawakening are all parts of the dr=\r\neam. When you attain jnana you will see\nthere was neither the dream during =\r\nsleep, nor the waking state, but only\nyourself and your real state.\n\nDevote=\r\ne pressed Bhagavan, =E2=80=9CBut what is the answer to the question? Why\nsh=\r\nould not the waking state also pass like our dreams without any effort on\no=\r\nur part and land us in jnana, as a dream passes off and leaves us awake?=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n\nBhagavan: Who can say that the dream passed off of its own accord? =\r\nIf the\ndream came on, as is generally supposed, as the result of our past t=\r\nhoughts\nor karma, probably the same karma also decides how long it should l=\r\nast and\nhow after that time it should cease.\n\nDevotee was still unsatisfied=\r\n and, as the result of further talk with\nBhagavan,and he feels that the wak=\r\ning state, though a sort of dream,is\nclearly distinct from the dream during=\r\n sleep in this, namely that during\ndream it never occurs to us that it is a=\r\n dream, whereas in the waking state\nwe are able to argue and understand fro=\r\nm books and gurus and from some\nphenomena that it may be only dream after a=\r\nll. Because of this, it may be\nour duty to make an effort to wake into jnan=\r\na.\n\nBhagavan says that we don=E2=80=99t deem a dream, a dream till we wake =\r\nup, that the\ndream looks quite real while it lasts; and that similarly this=\r\n waking state\nwill not appear a dream till we wake up into jnana.Because of=\r\n the above\ndifference between the dream and the waking states, our effort i=\r\ns called\nfor.\n\n\nSource: DAY BY DAY WITH BHAGAVAN By A.
