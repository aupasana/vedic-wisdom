Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any \n&gt; Hanuman temple\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my natal chart \nwhich \n&gt; =\r\nsuffers\n&gt; &gt; from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha in navamsa). When I \n=\r\n&gt; visited the\n&gt; &gt; Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, Thirumaz=\r\nhisai \nnear \n&gt; Chennai\n&gt; &gt; and asked the priest about a mantra, he advised =\r\nme to chant the \n&gt; mantra\n&gt; &gt; inscribed on the walls of the temple |sri ram=\r\n jaya ram jaya jaya \n&gt; ram| which\n&gt; &gt; comes out to be a 7 word, 10 aksharas=\r\n mantra. Energy from the 7th \n&gt; house to\n&gt; &gt; the 10th house with the mantra=\r\n devata sitting in lagna as per \n&gt; mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been =\r\ndoing this every evening since.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Later I came to know this is the R=\r\nama taraka mantra. My question \nis \n&gt; how does\n&gt; &gt; this mantra help to coun=\r\nter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly what is the correct form of=\r\n the Rama taraka mantra? Is it\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram|=\r\n - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; |om sri rama jaya rama jaya ja=\r\nya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some say it should be 13 aksharas=\r\n....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for astrological content in this mail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; best re=\r\ngards\n&gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
