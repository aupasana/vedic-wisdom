Free will is restricted to the\n&gt; amount of freedom the rop=\r\ne allows one.\n=A0\nRamakrishna is a master of explaining the toughest of phi=\r\nlosophical points using the simplest of analogies. His analogies are usuall=\r\ny quite apt and brilliant.\n=A0\nYes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of pa=\r\nst actions) is like a rope tied to the neck of a goat. The rope restricts t=\r\nhe movement of the goat, but does not determine where the goat goes and wha=\r\nt it does! That is upto the goat&#39;s free will.\n=A0\nA thirsty goat may look a=\r\nt a river nearby and despair as it cannot reach the river due to the rope. =\r\nIt may try and struggle continually, without reaching the river. Another th=\r\nirsty goat may realize that it cannot reach the river, accept that, look ar=\r\nound, find a small bucket of water behind it within reach if it negotiates =\r\nwith the rope and the obstacles. It may turn back, go, drink that water in =\r\nthe bucket and be happy.\n=A0\nWhile the destiny as frozen at the time of bir=\r\nth (and as reflected in the horoscope) is like the rope tying the goat and=\r\n=A0the surroundings of the goat, the actions of free will after birth are l=\r\nike the actions of the goat - how it accepts and negotiates the rope and it=\r\ns surroundings to get what it wants.\n=A0\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nToday&#39;s actions (karma) are tomorrow&#39;s destiny (karma). =\r\nSome of today&#39;s actions may impact destiny in a future life. Some of today&#39;=\r\ns actions may modify destiny for tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me ex=\r\ntend Ramakrishna&#39; s analogy to explain it.\n=A0\nA goat tied to a tree with a=\r\n rope may go around the tree a few times in one direction and the rope may =\r\nget shorter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach earl=\r\nier. Similarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten the des=\r\ntiny, make things worse and reduce one&#39;s options.\n=A0\n\nIt may go around the=\r\n tree a few times in another direction and the rope may get longer. It may =\r\nnow be able to reach places it was unable to reach earlier. Similarly, some=\r\n good acts of free will in this life may improve the destiny and make more =\r\nthings possible.\n=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n\nOn=\r\ne&#39;s mind is conditioned based on one&#39;s destiny. One&#39;s surroundings and life=\r\n situations faced by one are influenced by one&#39;s destinty. One will be pull=\r\ned in certain directions. One may feel attraction for=A0another person. Ano=\r\nther person may hate one an, abuse one and throw obstacles. One may not hav=\r\ne enough money to live happily. One may be adored by millions of people. An=\r\nd so on. One faces different life situations at different times and=A0in di=\r\nfferent matters.\n=A0\nHowever, destiny only shows how one (and one&#39;s mind) i=\r\ns pulled in various directions and what life situations one finds oneself i=\r\nn. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and one&#39;s circumstances, one can=\r\n still choose between different actions. The actions taken by one are not f=\r\nixed based on the horoscope. For example, one person may abuse one badly an=\r\nd one may feel great anger towards that person, all on account of a previou=\r\ns karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one can either succumb to the temp=\r\ntation and fight back or just ignore and move on.\n=A0\nDestiny places you in=\r\n different situations. What you do in those situations is based on how you =\r\nuse your free will. In some cases, free will has a lot of wiggle room and m=\r\nany options and, in some cases, it has fewer options. But, usually, you do =\r\nhave several options that may or may not be obvious and the action you fina=\r\nlly choose shapes your destiny in a future birth.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nPlease note that the Sanskrit word for des=\r\ntiny is karma and the Sanskrit word for action is also karma. Basically, ac=\r\ntions of today become destiny of tomorrow. You will get reaction in future =\r\nto your current actions and destiny is the sum total of those actions that =\r\nwill come back to you.\n=A0\nEach action of yours that impacts other beings a=\r\nnd objects of this universe will go towards forming your destiny for future=\r\n. (Here please note that both physical and mental actions count. Any emotio=\r\nns you feel towards someone else and do not necessary express outwardly=A0w=\r\nill also impact that person in a subtle manner and hence counts as an actio=\r\nn.)\n=A0\nHoroscope captures the good and bad actions, committed physically o=\r\nr mentally to other beings, until the current birth, which are to give thei=\r\nr reactions in this life. This is also known as destiny.\n=A0\nIt does not fi=\r\nx what you do in various situations in your current life. You have the abil=\r\nity to make different choices at important crossroads. The choices you make=\r\n are your karma (actions) and they shape your destiny for future. They may =\r\neither impact your current life itself, or become part of the destiny (as r=\r\neflected in the horoscope) in the next life.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nAnybody who tells you that so and so houses sho=\r\nw acts of free will does not understand what=A0free will is. Horoscope is t=\r\nhe frozen list of past karmas that form one&#39;s destiny for this life. It is =\r\nlike the rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are like how the goat negot=\r\niates the rope and moves around within the possible area=A0to do its stuff.=\r\n That is in the hands of the goat.\n=A0\nThe scope and options available to f=\r\nree will can be estimated from the horoscope, but the exact acts of free wi=\r\nll are unpredictable based on horoscope. To complicate things further, how =\r\nexactly free will has been used until now in this life=A0(which cannot be s=\r\neen from the horoscope) has an impact on the scope and options available to=\r\n free will at this time. The exertion of free will until now may have modif=\r\nied the destiny.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nI =\r\nam not downplaying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranjeevi predic=\r\ntion, the prediction that he would come into politics in 2007-2009 and enjo=\r\ny some kind of power was made using astrology. When someone is already a=A0=\r\ncandidate, even a random prediction of success or failure has a 1/2 or 1/3 =\r\nprobability. But, when there are no signs on the ground, a prediction on on=\r\ne&#39;s political entry in a specific timeframe has a very low probability. Suc=\r\nh a low probability prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology came true=\r\n. Moreover, we have all seen many cases where astrology worked spectacularl=\r\ny. I am not saying astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we do not at=\r\ntempt to understand its shortcomings.\n=A0\nWhen someone&#39;s free will works in=\r\n a predictable way, i.e. when one&#39;s free will has very few options and/or o=\r\nne reacts to life situations thrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, =\r\njob of an astrologer is easier. But, when free will has a wide range of opt=\r\nions and/or one used the free will powerfully, the gap between the destiny =\r\nas reflected by horoscope and the actual destiny as a result of those actio=\r\nns may make an astrologer fail.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. =\r\nhome.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n--=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=A0=\r\n\n&gt; --- On Wed, 5/27/09, Shyam V.

At the t=\r\nime of that prediction, there were no such indications on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the groun=\r\nd. But he did come into politics in the same timeframe. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial=\r\n talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elections =\r\nwere in 2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legis=\r\nlator (MLA) in May 2009.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the original prediction =\r\nwas quite successful. However, I upped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ante last year by sugges=\r\nting that Chiranjeevi&#39; s party would do well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Tho=\r\nugh I was not specific regarding his level of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success and did not p=\r\nredict that he would become the Chief Minister, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was honestly expe=\r\ncting his party to do better than they managed. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the followup =\r\nof my original prediction is a failure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal observation that the success rate in high prof=\r\nile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regular predictions like =\r\nmarriage,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; charts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In some cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurate and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we make bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it can be a human error in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; judging various factors. However, that human error seems to be a littl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common in high profile political predictions than in regular=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions. What could be the reason?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonde=\r\nr if the factor of free will that is left out of astrology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a =\r\nbigger role in political charts. I will try to think loud and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elabo=\r\nrate what I mean.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth=\r\n chart contains the list of actions committed in previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives usi=\r\nng one&#39;s free will that are to give their reactions in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life.

In other word=\r\ns, destiny (sum of the actions of previous lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to give =\r\na reaction now) is too weighty and free will in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has littl=\r\ne scope. When the options available for the free will in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life =\r\nare limited, there may not be significant actions using free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will a=\r\nnd hence the modifications to destiny based on actions of this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life=\r\n may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient to predict\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful and high =\r\nprofile public\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less restrictions and more op=\r\ntions available for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free will. With their free will being mor=\r\ne free and powerful, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions committed by their free will may h=\r\nave a higher weightage. As we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are able to see only their destiny in=\r\n the horoscope (free will exercise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable to factor=\r\n in how free will was exercised in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life until now, we are perh=\r\naps handicapped in our predictions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a political=\r\n leader is in limelight and becomes MP or the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leader of opposition =\r\nin parliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjoying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some political =\r\npower. Previous karmas placed him in a position to enjoy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that power=\r\n. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pred=\r\niction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\nree will in this life until now make a difference in some high profile\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; charts?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just thinkin=\r\ng loud here.

At the time of that pr=\r\nediction, there were no such indications on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the grou=\r\nnd. But he did come into politics in the same timeframe. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; initial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elections were in 2009. Though his party did badly, he=\r\n was elected as a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legislator (MLA) in May 2009.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the original pre=\r\ndiction was quite successful. However, I upped&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the a=\r\nnte last year by suggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39; s party would do well&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though I was not specific regarding his =\r\nlevel of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success and did not predict that he would b=\r\necome the Chief Minister, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was honestly expecting h=\r\nis party to do better than they managed. Thus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the f=\r\nollowup of my original prediction is a failure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal observation that the success rate in high=\r\n profile&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regul=\r\nar predictions like marriage,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in=\r\n &quot;regular&quot; charts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn some\n cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurate and&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we mak=\r\ne bad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it =\r\ncan be a human error in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging various factors. How=\r\never, that human error seems to be a little&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more com=\r\nmon in high profile political predictions than in regular&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; predictions. What could be the reason?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor of free will that is left =\r\nout of astrology&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a bigger role in political ch=\r\narts. I will try to think loud and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate what I =\r\nmean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth chart contains=\r\n the list of actions committed in previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives\n us=\r\ning one&#39;s free will that are to give their reactions in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; life. However, as life goes on, one accumulates newer actions comm=\r\nitted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in THIS life using one&#39;s free will. What happe=\r\nns at any point of time in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function =\r\nof ALL actions committed by one until that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of =\r\ntime, INCLUDING the actions committed in THIS life until now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using one&#39;s free will in THIS life,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at important crossroads in life, should imp=\r\nact the life&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events from then onwards.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people are weighed down by =\r\ntoo many karmas and always playing a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catchup. In oth=\r\ner words, destiny (sum of the actions of previous lives&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; which are to give a reaction now) is too weighty and free\n will in this=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has little scope. When the options available f=\r\nor the free will in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are limited, there may=\r\n not be significant actions using free&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will and henc=\r\ne the modifications to destiny based on actions of this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; life may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient to predic=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful and high profile public&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less restrictions and more opt=\r\nions available for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free will. With their free =\r\nwill being more free and powerful, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions commi=\r\ntted by their free will may have a higher weightage. As we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; are able to see only their destiny in the horoscope (free will exerc=\r\nise&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable to\n factor in how free wi=\r\nll was exercised in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life until now, we are perh=\r\naps handicapped in our predictions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a political leader is in limelight and becomes MP =\r\nor the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leader of opposition in parliament or the Pri=\r\nme Minister, he is enjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some political power. Pr=\r\nevious karmas placed him in a position to enjoy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n power. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; prediction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the =\r\nexercise of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free will in this life until now make a =\r\ndifference in some high profile&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charts?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just thinking loud here.
