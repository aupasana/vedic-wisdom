Some people also offer whole toor dal \nfor Mars (small pigeon=\r\n peas).\n\n*        *        *\n\nThis reminds me of one incident. In my daily =\r\nChandi homam, one of the \nstandard substances I offer is dried Tulsi (holy =\r\nbasil) leaves, bought \nat a local Indian store. Though Tulasi is dear to Vi=\r\nshnu, She is said to \nbe disliked by Ganesha (there is a Puranic story for =\r\nthat). So, Tulasi \nleaves are nishiddha (prohibited) as an offering to Gane=\r\nsha. I usually \nstick to all the rules I am aware of. So I offer Tulasi onl=\r\ny to the \nMother and never to Ganesha.\n\nOne Friday during last navaratris, =\r\nI took a day off from work and spent \nit in a special sadhana. I spent from=\r\n early morning till 2 pm doing \nhomam to Lakshmi and Narayana with continuo=\r\nus repetition of Narayana \nHridayam and Lakshmi Hridayam and then spent the=\r\n rest of the day \nchanting the same pair of stotras over and over again. In=\r\n the beginning \nof the day, when I was making offerings to Ganesha in fire,=\r\n I put Tulasi \nleaves in fire unconsciously (they were next to me and I gra=\r\nbbed them \nwithout thinking). After making the offering, I realized my mist=\r\nake, and \nmentally apologized. But I got a clear sense that there was nothi=\r\nng \nwrong or nothing to worry. Moreover, I had my best experience ever \ndur=\r\ning homam, on that day.\n\n*        *        *\n\nDo the sadhana with a simple,=\r\n innocent and pure heart, without expecting \nany selfish results. Then, wha=\r\ntever you do, whether granted by \nscriptures or prohibited, will become a p=\r\nure offering to the Lord. The \nphysical materials we offer to Lord are just=\r\n a proxy and the real \noffering is our attitude and thoughts that accompany=\r\n them. Of course, \nfollow the rules when you can, but do not worry too much=\r\n about the \nproxy. Worry about the real offering instead!\n\n*        *      =\r\n  *\n\nIf one thinks and analyzes too much, the onus is on that person to \nan=\r\nalyze correctly and come to the right conclusion. If one is too \nknowledgea=\r\nble, the onus is on that person to apply the knowledge.\n\nOne who is not tha=\r\nt knowledgeable and does not think much and simply \ndoes sadhana with a sim=\r\nple and innocent attitude and a sense of \nsurrender is blessed. The onus is=\r\n on guru and Lord to make that person \ncross the ocean of samsara.\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Acharyulu &lt;ach=\r\naryulug@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Shri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt;    Can I offer Red Ol=\r\neander (=C3=A0=C2=B0=C5=BD=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0 =\r\n=C3=A0=C2=B0=E2=80=94=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A8=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A8=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=B1=E2=80=A1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B1 \n&gt; =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AA=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B0=C2=B2=C3=A0=C2=B1) during Kuja Homa besides Til and Puffed rice. \n&gt; Act=\r\nually the flowers look pink or rose color.
