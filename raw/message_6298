When a pleasant cool southern breeze is blowing, what need =\r\nis\nthere for a fan?\n\n678 Fever is overcome by the cool light of the moon; w=\r\nant by the\nwish-yielding tree; and sin by the holy Ganges. Those three =E2=\r\n=80=93 fever and want\nand sin =E2=80=93 all flee at the august sight of the=\r\n peerless sage.\n\n679 Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols, which ar=\r\ne made of stone\nand clay, are not as mighty as the sages are. For while the=\r\ny make one pure\nin the course of countless days, the sage=E2=80=99s eye by =\r\na mere glance purifies at\nonce.\n\n680 Bathing in the Ganges removes the sins=\r\n of man, not the sinner in him.\nBut association with a sage destroys the si=\r\nnner also. There is nothing so\npowerful to purify the mind as association w=\r\nith a sage.\n\nThe sage=E2=80=99s greatness is further set forth as follows.\n=\r\n\n681 He is the conqueror of death, of the demon of three cities, of cupid,\n=\r\nand of the demon Naraka. He is the Self of all the great gods, and all alik=\r\ne\nworship only him.\n\nHow he is the killer of the demon Tripura and of the d=\r\nemon Naraka is\nexplained next.\n\n682 Since it is through him that the three =\r\nbodies [encompassing the Self]\nexist, he is therefore the killer of Tripura=\r\n. Because he has put an end to\nthe ego, he is therefore also the killer of =\r\nNaraka.\n\nThe three bodies are the gross, subtle and causal, already stated.=\r\n Naraka is\nthe personification of the ego.\n\n683 Since in the Gita Bhagavan =\r\nKrishna himself says, =E2=80=98I myself am the sage,=E2=80=99\nit therefore =\r\nfollows that there is none equal to or greater than he. His\ngreatness is im=\r\nmeasurable.\n\n684 Since the sage is God himself, his teachings are of the hi=\r\nghest\nauthority. Thereafter, and by his words alone, the Upanishads also ha=\r\nve\nauthority.\n\n685 Since the Guru, if he is a sage, is the second form of G=\r\nod=E2=80=99s grace, the\naspirant practising devotion to him [as to God], wi=\r\nll reach his goal.\n\nDivine grace has three forms in three stages: first as =\r\nGod, then as Guru and\nfinally as the real Self. The above verse is based up=\r\non this ancient\nteaching, and was repeated by Bhagavan.\n\n686 In the sage=E2=\r\n=80=99s presence and even far away from him there is a mysterious\npower. Wh=\r\noever is caught hold of by it will not be let go, but will surely\nbe taken =\r\nto the state of deliverance.\n\nTherefore, those that are positively determin=\r\ned not to obtain deliverance,\nbeing greatly in love with samsara, should be=\r\nware of sages!\n\n687 The Guru has said, =E2=80=98Just as a fawn caught by a =\r\ntiger becomes its food,\nso, if a good man is caught by the gracious look of=\r\n the sage, he will surely\nattain the state in which the sage dwells.=E2=80=\r\n=99\n\n688 Being outside he [the Guru] turns the mind of the sadhaka inwards =\r\nand\nfrom inside he pulls the mind into the Heart and then fixes him, by his=\r\n\npower, in the supreme state.\n\n689 That supreme state of the sage transcend=\r\ns both words and intellect. What\nhas been set forth here is just a little, =\r\nwhich has been vouchsafed by the\nsages for the sadhaka.\n\n690 Thus has been =\r\nexpounded the natural state of the Self, along with the\nmeans of attainment=\r\n [sadhana]. Hereafter is set forth the essence of the\nteachings for reflect=\r\nion by sadhakas.\n\nThe remainder of the work sets forth Bhagavan=E2=80=99s o=\r\nwn commentary on the first\nbenedictory verse of the Forty Verses.\n\n691 Ever=\r\ny creature is aware of its own spectacle, the world, and its seer,\nhimself.=\r\n He understands these two as real in their own right. This delusion\nis the =\r\ncause for its samsara.\n\n692 If the two were real in their own right, they w=\r\nould appear continuously.\nHow can something that appears at some times and =\r\ndoes not appear at other\ntimes be real?\n\n693 This pair [the world appearanc=\r\ne and the one who sees it] shines in dream\nand waking only by the functioni=\r\nng of the mind. In deep sleep both of them\nfail to shine. Therefore both of=\r\n them are mental.\n\n694 That into which the mind goes into latency and where=\r\nfrom it rises again\nis alone real. That one, being without settings and ris=\r\nings, is real in its\nown right, and is the home of deliverance for the aspi=\r\nrant.\n\n695 That reality named Brahman, which is only one without a second a=\r\nnd\ncomplete in itself, is the giver of existence to the whole world. It als=\r\no\ngives the light of consciousness to the whole mind, which in itself lacks=\r\n\nconsciousness.\n\n696 That itself dwells in the Heart of all creatures as on=\r\ne=E2=80=99s own Self, like\na witness without thoughts, unrelated to anythin=\r\ng. But that one is concealed\nduring the outward-turned state of the mind by=\r\n the false appearance of the\nworld, which is a manifestation of the mind.\n\n=\r\n697 Therefore, due to illusion, no one in the world knows this real Self.\nB=\r\neing persuaded that the gross body is itself the Self, one wanders through\n=\r\ninnumerable lives, suffering unhappiness.\n\n698 This world must be discovere=\r\nd to be the supreme, who is the real Self,\nby extinction of the mind. Then =\r\nthe pure real Self will shine unhindered, as\nhe really is, as the sole real=\r\nity, Brahman.\n\n699 If and when one makes efforts for deliverance, equipped =\r\nwith\ndiscrimination and detachment, following the means taught by the holy =\r\nGuru,\none becomes free from the bondage of samsara by attaining birth in on=\r\ne=E2=80=99s own\nsource, Brahman.\n\n700 By turning one=E2=80=99s thought-free=\r\n mind inwards and diving into the Heart in\nthe quest of one=E2=80=99s own r=\r\neal Self, by becoming free from delusion by the\nextinction of the ego-mind,=\r\n one attains the state of deliverance. Such a one\nis a sage.\n\nThe following=\r\n is the concluding verse.\n\n701 To that supreme one, the Self in all creatur=\r\nes, which became our Guru,\nSri Ramana, let there be thousands of namaskaram=\r\ns until there comes about\nthe extinction of the ego.\n\nSource: http://www.da=\r\nvidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636426cd33f133604a326cf38\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;M=\r\nARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;677 When one has learned to love the company of sages, why all these rule=\r\ns of discipline?
