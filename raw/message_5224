Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be only requ=\r\nired in the initial \n&gt;stages when you are still struggling to acquire a ste=\r\nady mind needed for mantra \n&gt;sadhana success. Once you have achieved some l=\r\nevel of success, discipline that \n&gt;may have been required in the initial st=\r\nages is no longer necessary.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have read a few of Sivanandas books....mo=\r\nst of them are available on their \n&gt;website for free downloads as pdf. And =\r\nwhat he has stated is that to develop a \n&gt;steady mind, strict discipline is=\r\n necessary on food and detachment from sexual \n&gt;activity as would be=C2=A0i=\r\nn celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you mind, \n&gt;you may give up t=\r\nhis discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he did a lot \n&gt;of penanc=\r\ne while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that people thing \n&gt;of =\r\nhim today is essentially part of his adult life.....once he had already \n&gt;p=\r\nerfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana alone. You read=\r\n any \n&gt;mythology, purana or granth and you will come across Rishi&#39;s who are=\r\n supposed to \n&gt;be pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be ever ready to =\r\ncurse anybody even with a \n&gt;slightest disappointment, most of them seemed t=\r\no have big egos.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do not know if you have read the Aghora books on Vima=\r\nlananda,=C2=A0 but if you read \n&gt;that, even when Vimalananda talks of givin=\r\ng up ego, he or his gurus did not like \n&gt;being challenged on any matter and=\r\n this is time and again=C2=A0seen in his books.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ofcourse above all, you =\r\nneed to keep your ego in control before the Lord even \n&gt;though you may be r=\r\neckless to other humans. There is someone I know....I do not \n&gt;know him per=\r\nsonally but only through message exchanges over groups like this. He \n&gt;seem=\r\ns to have knowledge of a lot of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite a lot of =\r\n\n&gt;them. Success seems to illude him though. According to him, when he does =\r\nsadhana \n&gt;for others, it succeeds immediately but not when he does this for=\r\n himself. And \n&gt;he was once=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help him o=\r\nut with the situation. I \n&gt;really do not know much about the various sadhan=\r\nas for achieving specific needs. \n&gt;So I suggested that instead of of asking=\r\n for suggestions of different sadhana \n&gt;from everybody, why does he not jus=\r\nt tell the lord in his prayer one day that \n&gt;the effects of his bad karmas =\r\nare getting too much to bear and if the Lord could \n&gt;provide him the succes=\r\ns he is looking for in his life. He retorted and shot back \n&gt;at me that he =\r\ndid not spend time and energy in learning these various tantric \n&gt;sadhanas =\r\njust to beg before god, he only knows how to demand from god.! I \n&gt;reminded=\r\n him that all this while, he was not having any problems begging for \n&gt;help=\r\n and suggestion from other group members and yet, he is not willing to beg =\r\n\n&gt;from god when really god is the one and only who can really do anything t=\r\nhe \n&gt;problems he is facing. I do not think even Ravana had that attitude th=\r\nat this \n&gt;person did,=C2=A0when he would sit down for his sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheer=\r\ns,\n&gt;Bhupendra\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n________________________________\nFrom: silentadmirer_=\r\nin &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Sent: Mo=\r\nn, November 15, 2010 11:44:16 AM\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Success with =\r\nMantras\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Namaskar,\n&gt;How did Ravana got success with Mantras if s=\r\nuccess with Mantras comes only with \n&gt;loss of Ahamkara and purity of mind ?=\r\n\n&gt;Where is the liberation without shakti, even the slaves were humble, devo=\r\nted and \n&gt;with complete surrender to their masters, what results did they e=\r\nver get ?\n&gt;There is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobhti us bhujang ko jis=\r\nke paas garal \n&gt;ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet saral ho&quot;.

I see many in this g=\r\nroup \n&gt;&gt;following such discipline and thanks to them. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this wonderful help is available, I still think we need to =\r\ngive \n&gt;&gt;the members something to focus on the Lord in terms of mantras like=\r\n you have \n&gt;&gt;done Mr. Jay-ji. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible=\r\n, Jay-ji, that we have a few simple mantras listed for \n&gt;&gt;the benefit of th=\r\ne members to address the common issues people face, plus to \n&gt;&gt;appease the =\r\nlords of the houses (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Balaji \n&gt;&gt;for s=\r\naturn etc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good to develop such \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;list and make them available in one place. I truly believe that would be m=\r\nore \n&gt;&gt;useful and powerful than prescribing remedies which may or may not w=\r\nork(with \n&gt;&gt;possible high degree of error possibilities in the charts). Bha=\r\nkti and \n&gt;&gt;meditation always would work!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. =\r\nPVR or other gurujis are reading this, I would appreciate it \n&gt;&gt;if they tak=\r\ne the leadership to develop such mantras and circulate for the \n&gt;&gt;benefit o=\r\nf the members.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very much!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With deep regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumark=\r\nb@&gt; \n&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant the below mantra at least 108 times everyday with deep belie=\r\nf \n&gt;&gt;and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopa=\r\nla Mantram\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krishna Mah=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9E=C3=82yogin\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakt=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82n=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=\r\n=82m Abhayam Kara\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82nanda\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82na Ya !!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi, you give shelter to y=\r\nour \n&gt;&gt;devotees.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, You are the giver of Supreme Bl=\r\niss.

Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be on=\r\nly required in the initial stages when you are still struggling to acquire =\r\na steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. Once you have achieved som=\r\ne level of success, discipline that may have been required in the initial s=\r\ntages is no longer necessary.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have read a fe=\r\nw of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website for fr=\r\nee downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a steady min=\r\nd, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual activi=\r\nty as would be&nbsp;in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you mind=\r\n, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he di=\r\nd a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that p=\r\neople thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....once he =\r\nhad already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana al=\r\none. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across Rish=\r\ni&#39;s who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they&nbsp;seem to be ever =\r\nready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of them s=\r\neemed to have big egos.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do not know if you h=\r\nave read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,&nbsp; but if you read that, even =\r\nwhen Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like being=\r\n challenged on any matter and this is time and again&nbsp;seen in his books=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ofcourse above all, you need to keep your eg=\r\no in control before the Lord even though you may be reckless to other human=\r\ns. There is someone I know....I do not know him personally but only through=\r\n message exchanges over groups like this. He seems to have knowledge of a l=\r\not of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite a lot of them. Success seems to ill=\r\nude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana for others, it succe=\r\neds immediately but not when he does this for himself. And he was once&nbsp=\r\n;asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I really =\r\ndo not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific needs. S=\r\no I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of different sadhan=\r\na from everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his prayer one day =\r\nthat the effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear and if the =\r\nLord could provide him the success he is looking for in his life. He retort=\r\ned and shot back at\n me that he did not spend time and energy in learning t=\r\nhese various tantric sadhanas just to beg before god, he only knows how to =\r\ndemand from god.! I reminded him that all this while, he was not having any=\r\n problems begging for help and suggestion from other group members and yet,=\r\n he is not willing to beg from god when really god is the one and only who =\r\ncan really do anything the problems he is facing. I do not think even Ravan=\r\na had that attitude that this person did,&nbsp;when he would sit down for h=\r\nis sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Cheers,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bhupendra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FO=\r\nNT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; FONT-FAMI=\r\nLY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D=\r\n2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/=\r\nSPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Mon, November 15, 2010=\r\n 11:44:16 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Success with Mantras&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;D=\r\nIV id=3Dyiv1959359882ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskar,&lt;BR&gt;How did Ravana got succes=\r\ns with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss of Ahamkara and=\r\n purity of mind ?&lt;BR&gt;Where is the liberation without shakti, even the slave=\r\ns were humble, devoted and with complete surrender to their masters, what r=\r\nesults did they ever get ?&lt;BR&gt;There is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobht=\r\ni us bhujang ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet=\r\n saral ho&quot;.

I am a strong believer that prayers to the Al=\r\nmighty are the ultimate answers to things not in our control. Thank you for=\r\n sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literally hundreds would ben=\r\nefit from this as they seek their solace. Bhakti is what makes people focus=\r\n more on internal strengths (of individuals) and become stronger to overcom=\r\ne difficulties.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; I am student/have been a student of Astrology for 20+ years, and co=\r\nntinue to use it for guidance for the future, but do not expect predictions=\r\n would come true as there are factorial 12! x 9! factorial permutations and=\r\n combinations to deal with, virtually making it impossible to predict corre=\r\nctly. But for a trained eye and the learned gurus, and for those who have f=\r\nocused more on the good lord to\n seek the knowledge (with total discipline =\r\nand in submitting to the Lord unconditionally), this art becomes a science =\r\nas they acquire &quot;vak-suddhi&quot;; AND they are able to guide the people. I see =\r\nmany in this group following such discipline and thanks to them. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this wonder=\r\nful help is available, I still think we need to give the members something =\r\nto focus on the Lord in terms of mantras like you have done Mr. Jay-ji. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it poss=\r\nible, Jay-ji, that we have a few simple mantras listed for the benefit of t=\r\nhe members to address the common issues people face, plus to appease the lo=\r\nrds of the houses (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn=\r\n etc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good to develop such list an=\r\nd make them available in one place. I truly believe that would be more usef=\r\nul and powerful than\n prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with p=\r\nossible high degree of error possibilities in the charts). Bhakti and medit=\r\nation always would work!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other gurujis are reading this, I would appr=\r\neciate it if they take the leadership to develop such mantras and circulate=\r\n for the benefit of the members.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very much!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With deep regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc=\r\n/compose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_b=\r\nlank&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Dear All,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant the below mantra at least 108 times everyday with de=\r\nep belief and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopal=\r\na Mantram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krishna Mah=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82yogin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakt=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82n=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82m Abha=\r\nyam Kara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83=E2=80=9E=\r\n=C3=82nanda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9E=C3=82na Ya !!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi, you give sh=\r\nelter to your devotees.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, Y=\r\nou are the giver of Supreme Bliss.
