The fact that atlea=\r\nst 4 different \n&gt; spiritual leaders claimed to be his reincarnation clearly=\r\n shows that \n&gt; this is a difficult area to infer. Why would my personal opi=\r\nnion be \n&gt; relevant or useful?\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is it important anyway? Vishnu is g=\r\noing to come as Kalki. Are we to \n&gt; spend time anticipating and speculating=\r\n about Kalki or are we to worship \n&gt; previous incarnations - Narasimha, Ram=\r\na, Krishna etc - based on our \n&gt; taste?\n&gt; \n&gt; All we can say is that reincar=\r\nnated Ramakrishna and his people will \n&gt; execute an important spiritual mis=\r\nsion for our times. Exactly what they \n&gt; will do or how they will behave ca=\r\nnnot be said.\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, Narasimha, Vamana, Rama and Krishna were dras=\r\ntically \n&gt; different from each other. The lila may drastically change from =\r\none \n&gt; incarnation to another, but the purity will remain.\n&gt; \n&gt; This gentle=\r\nman wrote a detailed mail to me and some things stood out. \n&gt; For example, =\r\nhe wrote: &quot;We have notified, as an act of respect and \n&gt; politeness, the Ra=\r\nmakrishna Mission, and as expected, we were \n&gt; ridiculized and despised.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Krishna did not go to Ayodhya or tell people of Ayodhya that he was \n&gt; =\r\nRama&#39;s reincarnation. Even with Jambavanta, he revealed himself as Rama \n&gt; =\r\nto Jambavanta only after circumstances brought them together and they \n&gt; fo=\r\nught a duel for many days (after all, that was the boon Jambavanta \n&gt; asked=\r\n Rama!).\n&gt; \n&gt; If Ramakrishna is really reincarnated, I would not expect him=\r\n to \n&gt; &quot;notify&quot; Ramakrishna mission. He would just execute his new mission =\r\nand \n&gt; new symbols *may* eventually emerge from that new mission. He wouldn=\r\n&#39;t \n&gt; care about old symbols. After all, Ramakrishna himself presumably kne=\r\nw \n&gt; who he was in the very previous incarnation, but did not make much ado=\r\n \n&gt; about it..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; will surely make waves.\n&gt; \n&gt; He may or may not become=\r\n famous while alive, but his work will touch the \n&gt; lives of many spiritual=\r\n seekers for a few centuries. That much can be \n&gt; said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I usually th=\r\nink that may be Manish Ji, and you can be part of his \n&gt; &gt; Group.\n&gt; &gt; Well,=\r\n for a stupid person like me, It is another &#39;wild Guess&#39;  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; This may =\r\njust be your ego at work.

So your ego \n&gt; may want to thi=\r\nnk that we are important people.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you receive a parcel containing a =\r\nkey to a box full of gold, who \n&gt; delivered the parcel is irrelevant. Your =\r\nlife is made if the key indeed \n&gt; opens the box of gold, irrespective of wh=\r\no delivered the parcel. People \n&gt; can benefit from any spiritual writings o=\r\nr homam manuals here, without \n&gt; putting us on a pedestal. As I said earlie=\r\nr, Manish&#39;s clear instruction \n&gt; was that we should guard against focusing =\r\non personalities and building \n&gt; awe and should instead focus on sadhana.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Ego has two aspects: I-ness and mine-ness. Demons Sumbha and Nisumbha i=\r\nn \n&gt; the Chandipath are symbols of those two qualities in us. Mine-ness \n&gt; =\r\nextends to many matters in many ways.
