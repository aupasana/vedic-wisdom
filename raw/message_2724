The well known Pt. Gopi Krishna, who =\r\nonly meditated on Sahasrara (crown of his head) had the experience appended=\r\n below, please read if you havent seen it earlier. Also what is your proof =\r\nthat meditating on a chakra effaces it - this is not obvious - why might it=\r\n not intensify it while purifying it? Is there any definitive text on Kunda=\r\nlini (Sat cakra nirupana is just too broad and symbolic for me)..\n\nRegards,=\r\n\n\nSundeep\n\nGopi Krishna:\n&quot;Over a period of years, he developed the ability =\r\nto sit for a period of hours in concentration without any discomfort. The f=\r\nollowing account which took place in 1937 describes his first Kundalini exp=\r\nerience which occurred while he was visualizing &quot;an imaginary Lotus in full=\r\n bloom, radiating light&quot; at the crown of his head.\n\n    Suddenly, with a ro=\r\nar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light entering my br=\r\nain through the spinal cord.\n\n    Entirely unprepared for such a developmen=\r\nt, I was completely taken by surprise; but regaining my self-control, keepi=\r\nng my mind on the point of concentration. The illumination grew brighter an=\r\nd brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then =\r\nfelt myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light.=\r\n It is impossible to describe the experience accurately. I felt the point o=\r\nf consciousness that was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light.=\r\n It grew wider and wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the im=\r\nmediate object of its perception, appeared to have receded into the distanc=\r\ne until I became entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness wi=\r\nthout any outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, without any fee=\r\nling or sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light simult=\r\naneously conscious and aware at every point, spread out, as it were, in all=\r\n directions without any barrier or material obstruction. I was no longer my=\r\nself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small poi=\r\nnt of awareness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle of consci=\r\nousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state o=\r\nf exultation and happiness impossible to describe.\n    Krishna, Pandit Gopi=\r\n, Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness (New Delhi: Orient Paperbacks, 19=\r\n92), pps. 6-7 &quot;\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a bod=\r\ny that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physi=\r\ncal aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, cert=\r\nain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one=\r\n is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness=\r\n. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid*=\r\n in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. K=\r\nundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid*=\r\n or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still r=\r\nemaining. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kundal=\r\nini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus =\r\nflowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *n=\r\not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves =\r\nMoolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notions=\r\n of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each ele=\r\nment is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as =\r\nwell as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one elemen=\r\nt (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of tim=\r\ne, is not at all easy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one=\r\n progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kund=\r\nalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse orde=\r\nr - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n\n\n\n"}}
