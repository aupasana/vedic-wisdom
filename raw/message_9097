Why not accept \nwhatever comes our way as &#39;PRASAD&#39; from=\r\n Isvara and move on.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nMy response: The final goal is indeed to reach=\r\n a state of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of=\r\n Lord, with an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive th=\r\ne fruits of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agita=\r\nted that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may r=\r\nesult in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nThus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending=\r\n karmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer s=\r\ntate of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruit=\r\ns better. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really ba=\r\nd karma, makes progress during that borrowed\n time, reaches an equanimous s=\r\ntate of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated bei=\r\nng with a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and =\r\nsanchitha and agami are what we going to do.\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Actually s=\r\nanchita karmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Pra=\r\nrabdha karmas are different in the sense that their fructification has alre=\r\nady begun. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; m=\r\neans &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that =\r\nwas] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction=\r\n has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled u=\r\np karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed ind=\r\nefinitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic S=\r\nelf without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of =\r\nprarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced eve=\r\nn by a liberated being.\n=C2=A0\nThough fruits of prarabdha karmas are alread=\r\ny in the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottom=\r\nline is that there are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level =\r\neven for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is p=\r\nossible.\n\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 3:How does nishkam karma wo=\r\nrks? In other words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where doe=\r\ns the reaction goes?\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: If one identifies with a body-mind=\r\n complex and a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its selfish=\r\n agenda, one keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal identificat=\r\nion with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and enga=\r\nges in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but not drive=\r\nn by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then one=\r\n is untouched by karmas performed in that state.\n=C2=A0\nIn the words of Swa=\r\nmi Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated and current actions of a Jnani=\r\n take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In other words, Sanchita karmas (pile=\r\nd up actions from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karm=\r\nas (actions being performed right now) of a liberated being take shelted in=\r\n\n Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).\n\n=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n=C2=A0\nComment 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? A=\r\nnd if i am being \npunished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am=\r\n i not aware of it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad =\r\ndeeds.\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: One need not pray to God.All one needs to do is =\r\nto stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas fr=\r\nom the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable st=\r\nate of mind in which that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumulto=\r\nus hurricane caused in one&#39;s life due to serious bad karmas from the past. =\r\nOnce serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material wor=\r\nld and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgme=\r\nnt, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even =\r\nmore bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and =\r\nqualities that God represents can give a shelter to the mind in which it ca=\r\nn maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for=\r\n one, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.\n=C2=A0\nGod has no agenda to =\r\neither punish you or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer of react=\r\nions to all actions. If there is something unreasonable about the reaction =\r\nyou are getting, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness.\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0Let me turn around your question on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple quest=\r\nion. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person w=\r\nhy we are doing it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before cau=\r\nsing loss or hurt to us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and p=\r\nure for no reason, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible=\r\n strife to me despite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIn fact, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action t=\r\nhat caused what is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More use=\r\nful is your conscience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells y=\r\nou right from wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will giv=\r\ne good reactions *in future*.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 5: Vasa=\r\nna can be for wealth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for power!) etc. =\r\nMany ripus, many reasons...!\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Well-said. Though we are d=\r\niscussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in =\r\nchittaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaak=\r\naasha is the space of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, d=\r\nesires, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in=\r\n Yoga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yo=\r\ngaH&quot; (resisting the working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in=\r\n Yoga Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense a=\r\nnd some are very subtle. But all of them bind us.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nComment 6:1. As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the kar=\r\nmas as Homa to inner \ndevas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is less=\r\ner of suffering if \nyou do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of th=\r\nat karma alone. It is a function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of m=\r\nind. If someone serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half =\r\nday or diaria for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the s=\r\name karmaphala set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physi=\r\ncal & subtle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s c=\r\nurrent state of mind.\n=C2=A0\nAn idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds ke=\r\nep vibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfi=\r\nsh desires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effec=\r\nts of one&#39;s environment (through which fruits of karmas are\n administered).=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nIf one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates vario=\r\nus ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik ene=\r\nrgy, it absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s environment better or at leas=\r\nt does not amplify them.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology =\r\n& Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=\r\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

I will add my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0The cosmos run=\r\ns based on the fundamental law that each action (karma) gives a reaction/re=\r\nsult (karmaphala) commensurate with it. Shakti is the sum total of all the =\r\nbeings with various agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing var=\r\nious karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Though each ka=\r\nrma should give karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *=\r\nagent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a co=\r\nmplicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness =\r\n(i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing=\r\n* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;At an=\r\ny time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmap=\r\nhala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala=\r\n in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experie=\r\nnced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools i=\r\ns based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;The assignment and ordering of these pools will constantly undergo chu=\r\nrn as one engages in various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, =\r\nas new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delive=\r\nry agents and sequencing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;As one engages in remedial measures suc=\r\nh as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, chang=\r\ne one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (inc=\r\nluding planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karma=\r\nphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of deliv=\r\nery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable kar=\r\nmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the sa=\r\nme pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or push=\r\ned up in order within the same pool.\n&gt;=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses =\r\none, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thi=\r\nng can happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools=\r\n. Every action by one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-a=\r\nrrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postpone=\r\nd or a karma that was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced s=\r\nooner.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as in=\r\ntense as the karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small ro=\r\nck with small force, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hil=\r\nl.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a s=\r\npecific result, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what =\r\nritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in=\r\n their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in =\r\ntheir optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can =\r\noften make some difference.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;This point is well illustrated by the =\r\n&quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s =\r\nactions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show f=\r\navoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God=\r\n is a witness to the play of actions and fruits.

The best we can do with them, wi=\r\nth some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thi=\r\nng is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, s=\r\nelfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas=\r\n and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others =\r\nare good karmas.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pi=\r\npeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current =\r\naction, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastra=\r\ns, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One th=\r\ning is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commens=\r\nurate with the karma\n itself.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;You need only small force to push a =\r\ncat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;--------\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;________________________=\r\n________\n&gt;&gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: R=\r\ne: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Dear=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by =\r\nthe courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a b=\r\neggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king,=\r\n and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. Th=\r\ne elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The m=\r\ninister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And =\r\nthe citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the =\r\nresult.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oa=\r\nth. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are =\r\nactually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amoun=\r\nt of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nWhen it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assum=\r\nption. We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person are h=\r\nis many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We=\r\n then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic =\r\npipeline.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the =\r\nsame thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressi=\r\nons ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or cour=\r\nse, that is easier said than done.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Any moment when your mind become=\r\ns quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your mind becomes agitated is a curs=\r\ne.

However, it is not easy. When we =\r\nreceive the fruits of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted=\r\n and agitated that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. =\r\nThis may result in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/conf=\r\nused state.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some real=\r\nly bad impending karmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one re=\r\naches a calmer state of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to hand=\r\nle the bad fruits better. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes=\r\n off a really bad karma, makes progress during that borrowed\n time, reaches=\r\n an equanimous state of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as=\r\n a liberated being with a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitate=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment=\r\n 2&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2116634567yui_3_7_2_18_1362375052103_47&quot;&gt;P=\r\nrarabda karma is which was already done and sanchitha and agami are what we=\r\n going to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Actually sanchita ka=\r\nrmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha kar=\r\nmas are different in the sense that their fructification has\n &lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;already begun&lt;/span&gt;. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to =\r\nbegin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; means &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun for=\r\nm &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that was] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are action=\r\ns for which the process of reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. =\r\nWhereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas that have not kicked off their =\r\nfruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated whil=\r\ne living, one can merge in Cosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of s=\r\nanchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipe=\r\nline and need to be experienced even by a liberated being.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Tho=\r\nugh fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline, even they can a=\r\nctually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that there are agents of d=\r\nelivery at the physical and subtle level even for things deep in the pipeli=\r\nne and hence some limited adjustment is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div\n style=3D&quot;color: =\r\nrgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; background-color: transparent; font-style: n=\r\normal; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-=\r\nserif; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:it=\r\nalic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size=\r\n:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:=\r\n arial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:=\r\n arial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt&gt;How does &lt;i&gt;nishkam karma&lt;/i&gt; works?

But, if one has minimal identifi=\r\ncation with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and e=\r\nngages in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but not dr=\r\niven by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then =\r\none is untouched by karmas performed in that state.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the wor=\r\nds of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated and current actions o=\r\nf a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In other words, Sanchita kar=\r\nmas (piled up actions from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aa=\r\ngami karmas (actions being performed right now) of a liberated being take s=\r\nhelted in\n Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: aria=\r\nl, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Comment 4&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If my destiny is=\r\n to suffer, why should I pray to God? And if i am being \npunished for some =\r\nkind of bad karma from the past, why am i not aware of\n it? It is like gett=\r\ning punishment without knowing your bad deeds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-st=\r\nyle:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;need not pray to God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; All one needs to do is to stop engagi=\r\nng in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas from the past. M=\r\nore importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable state of mind in=\r\n which that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumultous hurricane c=\r\naused in one&#39;s life due to serious bad karmas from the past. Once serious t=\r\nroubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material world and one&#39;s p=\r\nleasures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgment, starts pur=\r\nsuing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even more bad karma=\r\ns. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and qualities that=\r\n God represents can give a shelter to the mind in\n which it can maintain so=\r\nme calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for one, perhaps=\r\n one needs to perfect it further.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;God has no agenda to either punish you or hide=\r\n the reason. God is an impartial balancer of reactions to all actions. If t=\r\nhere is something unreasonable about the reaction you are getting, it means=\r\n your action had a similar unreasonableness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:itali=\r\nc;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me turn around your question on being &quot;awa=\r\nre&quot; and ask a simple question. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we=\r\n always tell that person why we are doing it? If not, how can we expect som=\r\neone to tell us before causing loss or hurt to\n us? If I caused terrible st=\r\nrife to someone pious and pure for no reason, then Nature will use someone =\r\nin future to cause terrible strife to me despite my piety and purity and ap=\r\nparently for no reason.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In fact, what will you achieve by know=\r\ning exactly what was the action that caused what is happening to you right =\r\nnow? Why is that useful? More useful is your conscience (a representation o=\r\nf God in each heart) that tells you right from wrong.

(Chidaakaasha is the =\r\nspace of pure consciousness and chittaakaasha is the space of conditioned c=\r\nonsciousness that has likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc.) Vasishtha def=\r\nined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yoga Vaasishtham and Patanjali def=\r\nined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH&quot; (resisting the working of cond=\r\nitioning is\n &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;oneness with Cosmic Self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in Yoga=\r\n Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and so=\r\nme are very subtle. But all of them bind us.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;Comment 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:smal=\r\nl;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, san=\r\ns-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;1. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;As\n per Shri Vimalananda, you may=\r\n also offer all the karmas as Homa to inner \ndevas or ishta devta? He menti=\r\noned that there is lesser of suffering if \nyou do that. Who gets the remain=\r\ning delta suffering?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Karmaphala for a specifi=\r\nc karma is not a function of that karma alone. It is a function of that kar=\r\nma and one&#39;s current state of mind. If someone serves spoiled food, one may=\r\n get an upset stomach for half day or diaria for a week. It depends on how =\r\nstrong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphala set in motion by the same ext=\r\nernal agents of delivery (physical &amp; subtle) can cause different reacti=\r\non inside one, depending on one&#39;s current state of mind.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An id=\r\nle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds keep vibrating with various notions =\r\nand thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish desires and unnecessary clutter=\r\n/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects of one&#39;s environment (through w=\r\nhich fruits of karmas are\n administered).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one thinks of ish=\r\nta devata with reverence and contemplates various ideals and qualities of i=\r\nshta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik energy, it absorbs the negative=\r\n effects of one&#39;s environment better or at least does not amplify them.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spiritu=\r\nality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\ncolor: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; background-color: transparent; font-s=\r\ntyle: normal; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;--------&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, =\r\n16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, =\r\nsans-serif; &quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman=\r\n&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with va=\r\nrious agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphal=\r\nas. Purusha is the witness of it all.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Though each karm=\r\na should give karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *ag=\r\nent* to deliver the\n karmaphala, i.e. another\n being. So this\n requires a c=\r\nomplicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness=\r\n (i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencin=\r\ng* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;must &lt;/span&gt;experience karmaphala in this=\r\n life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;preferabl=\r\ny &lt;/span&gt;experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third=\r\n pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigne=\r\nd and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala =\r\nsequencing of all beings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The assignment and ord=\r\nering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in variou=\r\ns new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s l=\r\nife, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents\n and sequencing m=\r\nay change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As one engages in remedial meas=\r\nures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s natur=\r\ne, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other bei=\r\nngs (including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery =\r\nof karmaphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents =\r\nof delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesir=\r\nable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order withi=\r\nn the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool=\r\n or pushed up in order within the same pool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;When som=\r\neone curses or blesses one, with &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;suffici=\r\nent &lt;/span&gt;mental force behind it (this is the key),\n the same thing &lt;span&gt;=\r\ncan &lt;/span&gt;happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik p=\r\nools. Every action by one, or even people around one, has the &lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;potential &lt;/span&gt;to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. =\r\nA karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not t=\r\no give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the ka=\r\nrma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small f=\r\norce, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a &lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;specific &lt;/span&gt;result, nobody can make one=\r\n experience &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;that &lt;/span&gt;result, no matte=\r\nr what ritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative ka=\r\nrmas in their optional pool and even evil people\n have a lot of positive ka=\r\nrmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessi=\r\nngs can often make some difference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This point i=\r\ns well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his=\r\n point (3).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is=\r\n mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towar=\r\nds those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness t=\r\no the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that i=\r\nmpartially and impassionately manages the fine balance and order within thi=\r\ns play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lo=\r\nwest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and bal=\r\nanced delivery of fruits to actions using\n available agents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline=\r\n and will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them,=\r\n with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important =\r\nthing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline &lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-style:italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;span&gt;ow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Simply put, selfi=\r\nsh actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and=\r\n selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are =\r\ngood karmas.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pi=\r\npeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current =\r\naction, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastra=\r\ns, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One th=\r\ning is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commens=\r\nurate with the karma\n itself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You need only small force to pus=\r\nh a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; background-color: transpar=\r\nent; font-style: normal; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; =\r\n&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spiri=\r\ntuality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; background-color: transparent; fo=\r\nnt-style: normal; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;-----=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, =\r\n16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, =\r\nsans-serif; &quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman=\r\n&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:=\r\n29 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] few questions&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2116634567&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2116634567ygrp-=\r\ntext&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by th=\r\ne courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a beg=\r\ngar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the=\r\n ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the be=\r\nggar turned king.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything is interrelated. The =\r\nbeggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the =\r\none chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint t=\r\nhe elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live =\r\nin such a kingdom, and accept the result.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sa=\r\nnskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses=\r\n that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At=\r\n the end of the day, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech =\r\ndischarge their tapas shakti through speech.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whe=\r\nn it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumpti=\r\non. We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person are his =\r\nmany karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We th=\r\nen want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pip=\r\neline.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and =\r\n&#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but yo=\r\nur mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are =\r\nyour karmas.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, y=\r\nou have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier said than done.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. =\r\nAny moment when your mind becomes agitated is a curse.

I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something a=\r\nbout a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(2) On similar note, what hap=\r\npens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also come acro=\r\nss lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka G=\r\nanapati =E2=80=93 what do this items really do if they work? Something simi=\r\nlar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80=93 do they bring forward good=\r\n karmas or they create new ones?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(3) I recollect an episode from famo=\r\nus &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady =\r\ncried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we wors=\r\nhip God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but =\r\nlater tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next bir=\r\nth.
