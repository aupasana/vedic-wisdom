The spinal cord is like an uptu=\r\nrned tree, with man&#39;s hair as its roots, and afferent and efferent nerves a=\r\ns branches. The tree of the nervous system bears many enjoyable fruits, or =\r\nsensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. In these, man may righ=\r\ntfully indulge; but he was forbidden the experience of sex, the &#39;apple&#39; at =\r\nthe center of the bodily garden. \n\n&quot;The &#39;serpent&#39; represents the coiled;up =\r\nspinal energy which stimulates the sex nerves. &#39;Adam&#39; is reason, and &#39;Eve&#39; =\r\nis feeling. When the emotion or Eve;consciousness in any human being is ove=\r\nrpowered by the sex impulse, his reason or Adam also succumbs. \n\n&quot;God creat=\r\ned the human species by materializing the bodies of man and woman through t=\r\nhe force of His will; He endowed the new species with the power to create c=\r\nhildren in a similar &#39;immaculate&#39; or divine manner. Because His manifestati=\r\non in the individualized soul had hitherto been limited to animals, instinc=\r\nt;bound and lacking the potentialities of full reason, God made the first h=\r\numan bodies, symbolically called Adam and Eve. To these, for advantageous u=\r\npward evolution, He transferred the souls or divine essence of two animals.=\r\n \n\nIn Adam or man, reason predominated; in Eve or woman, feeling was ascend=\r\nant. Thus was expressed the duality or polarity which underlies the phenome=\r\nnal worlds. Reason and feeling remain in a heaven of cooperative joy so lon=\r\ng as the human mind is not tricked by the serpentine energy of animal prope=\r\nnsities.\n\n&quot;The human body was therefore not solely a result of evolution fr=\r\nom beasts, but was produced by an act of special creation by God. The anima=\r\nl forms were too crude to express full divinity; the human being was unique=\r\nly given a tremendous mental capacity;the &#39;thousand;petaled lotus&#39; of the b=\r\nrain;as well as acutely awakened occult centers in the spine.\n\n&quot;God, or the=\r\n Divine Consciousness present within the first created pair, counseled them=\r\n to enjoy all human sensibilities, but not to put their concentration on to=\r\nuch sensations. These were banned in order to\navoid the development of the =\r\nsex organs, which would enmesh humanity in the inferior animal method of pr=\r\nopagation. The warning not to revive subconsciously;present bestial memorie=\r\ns was not heeded. \n\nResuming the way of brute procreation, Adam and Eve fel=\r\nl from the state of heavenly joy natural to the original perfect man.\n&quot;Know=\r\nledge of &#39;good and evil&#39; refers to the cosmic dualistic compulsion. Falling=\r\n under the sway of MAYA through misuse of his feeling and reason, or Eve;an=\r\nd Adam;consciousness, man relinquishes his right to enter the heavenly gard=\r\nen of divine self;sufficiency. The personal responsibility of every human b=\r\neing is to restore his &#39;parents&#39; or dual nature to a unified harmony or Ede=\r\nn.&quot;\n\nAs Sri Yukteswar ended his discourse, I glanced with new respect at th=\r\ne pages of GENESIS.\n\n&quot;Dear Master,&quot; I said, &quot;for the first time I feel a pr=\r\noper filial obligation toward Adam and Eve!&quot;\n\n*** Extracts from: Autobiogra=\r\nphy of a Yogi - by Paramhansa Yogananda, 16th Chapter: Outwitting the Stars=\r\n ***\n\n\n\n"}}
