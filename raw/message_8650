This is also opinion of Mihir and Narasimha Garu.=\r\n unless ofcourse one has a spiritual Guru and full faith in Guru to just bl=\r\nindly perform the Sadhana commanded by Guru. for such person it is fine not=\r\n to roam around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Medium used in Sudarshan Kriya is Air (on gross level=\r\n atleast) while that in Homam/Havan is Fire and it is only logical to think=\r\n that there must lie some differences in terms of speed/quality/effects in =\r\ntheir respective evolutionary curves and as far as I am concerned, I have p=\r\nrobably had some knwoeldge of differences using Air and Fire. I can see tha=\r\nt Mihir&#39;s experience of SK is somewhat similar to mine. It&#39;ll be interestin=\r\ng to note here that I did perform a couple of havans with the inspiration o=\r\nf AOL and that was Mahamritunjaya Havan, back in 2006 (before i started Hav=\r\nan regularly in 2008 with the divine inspiration of Narasimha).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best R=\r\negards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot;=\r\n &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Vinayak,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [you are the one =\r\nof the 4\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prominent people who have influenced & inspired me on spirit=\r\nual path]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am sure the 2nd important person is me :)\n&gt; &gt; Jokes ap=\r\nart, let me share a little bit of my personal background on Sudrashan Kriya=\r\n and Homa as i have done both practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I learnt SK in 2005 and t=\r\nhen almost daily kept doing it till 2008 mid. I also learnt advance course =\r\nas well as Padmasadhana (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also regularly kept doing =\r\nPS ALMOST everyday. For about 3 years, I used to do SK and PS regularly. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now I got started with Homa on daily basis since 2008 Sept and keep=\r\n doing it till date (with few breaks/irregularities at times) and since the=\r\nn I have stopped SK, however sometime do PS as i enjoy that systematic Yoga=\r\nasanas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just gave above background which may help to assess.\n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n**\n&gt; &gt; SK and PS helped me cure some physical chronic issues which troubled=\r\n me since childhood and were helpful to strengthen my will power. It genera=\r\nted an inner attitude to sustain any problems or calamities life may throw =\r\nby making my mind generally calmer then it used to be. I am able to say tha=\r\nt because I actually faced deep crises in 2006 July to sept and I was still=\r\n more or less unperturbed and could handle the situation. i increasingly be=\r\ncome philosophical in my attitude.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now I started Chandi paath and =\r\nHavan combination in 2008. if i now sit back and look at things then i can =\r\nsee some striking differences. Havan and CP combination striked at my emoti=\r\nonal aspect. In the past, i was hardly tested on Emotional/Relational issue=\r\ns in general with society. i hardly faced any trouble in that area. However=\r\n, when I started Havan and CP, it looks that it badly attacked this aspect =\r\nof my being and I was severely tested. in Short, My public relations which =\r\nused to be always excellent (naturally) started falling apart. It shook me =\r\nup very badly as it never happened in the past and I did not have enough ex=\r\nperience, knowledge to handle such things. severe EQ testing then surfaced =\r\nother weaknesses which i felt that i never had :-). it amazed me at one sid=\r\ne while at the same time It threw a formidable challenge to my so called **=\r\nballooned spiritual ego**. All these happening were more inside and much le=\r\nss tangible outside. There are crises i went through in my job which also t=\r\nested me a lot. I lost a good some of money in a cheating case within 6 mon=\r\nths of starting Havan. however, fortunately I intuitionally realised that M=\r\nother is removing bad karmas using Pavaka and I steadfastly kept doing Hava=\r\nn in the midst of all these emotional, financial, career, family troubles a=\r\nnd now it seems as if the dust have been settled more or less. quite peacef=\r\nul with myself after seeing Stars in the bright Sunny day ;-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; So if now i compare it, the peace of mind and will power given by SK an=\r\nd PS was a surface one. They never created a situation where in i was ruthl=\r\nessly tested on my weaknesses. So i would say that they are spiritual pract=\r\nices which worked quite slowly and quite easily without disturbing me. Whil=\r\ne CP and Homam actually turned me on my head. It started giving me a real k=\r\nind of Detachment, wisdom. Few vital things have become much clearer now.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Please note that these are my personal experiences and others ca=\r\nn have entirely different experiences. there are many variables in this. i =\r\njust tried to state my own experiences for whatever worth they may be. Plea=\r\nse also note that Havan Sadhana does not necessarily throw throubles in lif=\r\ne of people. It all depends upon Past Samskaars of individuals. we&#39;ll not k=\r\nnow such things.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Please forgive me to almost always write perso=\r\nnal things because I like to write the things which i have gone through mys=\r\nelf.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jay Bhavaani!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste Guruji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I consider you as my Guru as you are the one of the 4\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; prominent people who have influenced & inspired me on spiritual path(wha=\r\ntever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little I do) & I find your explanations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very very convinc=\r\ning.
