Some people emphasize th=\r\ne vedantic philosophy=A0and de-emphazie rituals, whereas some people are so=\r\n deeply immersed in rituals.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n=A0\nThe concept &quot;I am god&quot; (aham brahmaasmi) or &quot;you are That&quot; (tattv=\r\namasi) is very dangerous for many people. Though it is undoubtedly the ulti=\r\nmate truth, half-baked understanding of this supreme truth may result in ch=\r\naos in one&#39;s spiritual life. As I keep emphasizing, all these non-dualistic=\r\n (adwaitic) concepts are applicable to one who has transcended duality. If =\r\nopposites such as pleasure and pain, life and death, heaven and hell, prais=\r\ne and criticism etc are one and the same for a person and one sees the same=\r\n &quot;Self&quot; in all those opposites, then one can say &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot;. One who=\r\n sees these differently and finds one thing desirable and the other thing u=\r\nndesirable is not yet ready to declare &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot;. Just as one who s=\r\ntudied calculus at school but forgot it *completely* now cannot claim &quot;I kn=\r\now calculus&quot;, one who sees pleasure and pain differently has forgotten one&#39;=\r\ns true nature and it is futile to pretend &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot;.\n=A0\nI can give=\r\n a parable to loosely explain this.=A0A king forgot that he was king. His f=\r\nace, body and personality changed. His mannersims,=A0demeanor and style of =\r\nspeaking=A0also changed.=A0He left his palace, went to a nearby forest and =\r\nstarted living in a hut. Somebody came oneday and reminded him that he was =\r\nthe king. He then said &quot;I am the king. Let me go and take control of the pa=\r\nlace.&quot; When he went and tried to command the palace guards, he was not reco=\r\ngnized and beaten up by his own guards. As his face, behavior, mannerisms a=\r\nnd whole personality was different, he could not convince them he was the k=\r\ning. Instead of directly going to the palace, he should have practiced the =\r\nbehavior, mannerisms and style of speaking of king and then gone to the pal=\r\nace. Then he stood a chance of convincing the guards that he was=A0the king=\r\n.\n=A0\nSimilarly, each person is god. However, until one learns (again!) how=\r\n to think, act=A0and be like god, one is human. Until one learns how to loo=\r\nk at pleasure and pain, life and death, praise and crtiticism, heaven and=\r\n=A0hell etc=A0with an equal mind, one has not gotten back the characteristi=\r\ncs needed. Until then, &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot; is merely a theoretical statement.=\r\n\n=A0\nSomebody told me about a story apparently from Sai Baba&#39;s charitra. On=\r\ne guru taught &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot; to a sishya. It misled him, he became proud=\r\n and started looking at gurus, elders and all with disrespect and with a se=\r\nnse of pride and self-importance. At the end of his life, he went to hell a=\r\nnd met his guru there. He said &quot;I can understand how I, with my arrogant be=\r\nhavior and half knowledge, ended up here. But why are you here?&quot; The guru s=\r\naid &quot;for teaching tattva to somebody not ready like you!&quot;\n=A0\nLet the highe=\r\nst truths of vedanta be at the back of your mind, but make sure that they d=\r\no not mislead you or do dame to your spiritual progress.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThe concept &quot;I am god&quot; is so powerfu=\r\nl and prone to abuse. It seems like there are variations of it in new age s=\r\npiritualism. I have seen some books that marry positive and motivational=A0=\r\npsychology to &quot;I am god&quot; concept=A0of vedanta and pass it=A0off as a spirit=\r\nual path and as=A0aatma jnaana (self-knowledge) . Self-realization is not f=\r\neeling good about yourself, feeling confident about yourself and getting wh=\r\natever you want. Supreme cosmic being (Shiva or Krishna or whatever you cal=\r\nl) is the most powerful and can get anything, because he does not want anyt=\r\nhing.The dogma &quot;you can get whatever you want if you want it enough&quot; can le=\r\nad to a little progress, but one will get stuck. It is very unlikely to res=\r\nult in self-realization.\n=A0\nThe goal of sadhana is to pay back previous de=\r\nbts, remove the sense of I-ness in all actions, cut off desires and reach a=\r\n state where there is no different between opposites and there is nothing t=\r\nhat is desirable and nothing that is undesirable. It comes with sacrifice a=\r\nnd surrender and not with self-importance and self-centeredness. In an unpr=\r\nepared person, the statement &quot;I am god&quot; can induce self-importance, self-ce=\r\nnteredness, arrogance and false=A0self-assurance.\n=A0\nThough unmanifested B=\r\nrahman and manifested Brahman are the same in reality, there is a big diffe=\r\nrence between them in the eyes of a person who is immersed in the delusions=\r\n (opposites) of the manifested universe.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhile vedanta is fraught with dangers for the unprepa=\r\nred, the path of ritualism has its share of pitfalls. Many people engage in=\r\n rituals without understanding what they are meant for. One stuck in the ma=\r\nterial world needs to engage in actions using the objects of material world=\r\n as symbols and these symbols will eventually trigger the correct thinking =\r\nin the mind. There are many priests who do a nice pooja or homam and then f=\r\neel so proud about it. Actions engaged by one who is not making any effort =\r\nto reduce the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; in those actions are fruitless. As the =\r\nsense of &quot;I am doing&quot; comes down, one&#39;s actions will have more nectar and l=\r\ness poison. Rituals and various actions engaged by many people are poisoned=\r\n by the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; and the associated pride. If a ritual is perf=\r\normed with a sense of surrender, then the ritual works and increases the su=\r\nrrender further.=A0As surrender is increased, ritual will become better. As=\r\n ritual becomes\n better, surrender becomes better. One has to gain a suffic=\r\nient level of internal purity in order to break through into the groove.\n=\r\n=A0\nOne not realizing this will continue to run after the irrelevant and us=\r\neless. Such a person may cleanly bathe in the best rivers, wear the cleanes=\r\nt and most beautiful clothes prescribed in scriptures and do the rituals fo=\r\nllowing each instruction carefully. But, the strong sense of I-ness and pri=\r\nde may poison everything and take a long time for the person to make progre=\r\nss.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThis is why I k=\r\neep emphasizing that external rituals and internal transformation should go=\r\n hand in hand. Only one will not help. Both are needed. Consciously introsp=\r\nect your thoughts and cut off pride and selfishness at their root whenever =\r\nyou encounter them in your thoughts and then take advantage of rituals with=\r\n a sense of surrender. This combination will make one lose the false sense =\r\nof I-ness completely and then realize the true Self.\n=A0\nFrom &quot;somebody&quot; (l=\r\nimited sense of I-ness), most people have to first become a &quot;nobody&quot; (each =\r\nlayer of that I-ness shed off) before becoming &quot;everybody&quot; (realizing the S=\r\nelf as the all-pervading spirit).\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n=\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n=\r\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao \nTo: vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com \nSent: Saturday, April 18, 2009 9:07 PM\nSubject: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Why rituals?\n\nNamaste,\n=A0\nSome intelligent and rational people wond=\r\ner why we need to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I =\r\nwant to explain this basic point with an analogy.\n=A0\nWe teach some phrases=\r\n and manners to small children. For example, we tell small children to say =\r\n&quot;thank you&quot; when someone helps or say &quot;I am sorry&quot; when they do something w=\r\nrong. A really small child does not even understand what those words mean, =\r\nbut repeats them out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to underst=\r\nand the true meaning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding=\r\n of what they truly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are a=\r\nctually understood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or th=\r\ne picture of a mango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred w=\r\nords. As a child accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions =\r\nof the external world through senses), the child&#39;s thinking expands and one=\r\n gets more clarity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When =\r\none says sorry, one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even=\r\n feel a certain emotion (sadness and\n compassion).\n=A0\nSimilarly, one may b=\r\ne doing rituals like homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, wit=\r\nhout fully understanding or appreciating what one does.=A0One doing a ritua=\r\nl for many years without fully understanding its real meaning may slowly st=\r\nart to understand and even experience some things that the rituals symboliz=\r\ne. Many mantras and spiritual truths are actually understood from experienc=\r\ne alone. One can never fully=A0understand what one has never experienced. A=\r\ns we accumulate more experiences (stored perceptions of the external and in=\r\nternal world through external senses and the inward directed mind), one&#39;s t=\r\nhinking expands and one gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual tru=\r\nths one has been exposed to.\n=A0\nRituals in various religions are designed =\r\nto symblize some truths that gives bliss when experienced by one. A mere ex=\r\nplanation of the symbolism is often useless to give one that state of bliss=\r\n. Even if you explain to a one year old child what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means i=\r\nn detail, the child will not understand. The best thing to do is to just ge=\r\nt the child into the habit of saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; in approapriate situation=\r\ns. Slowly, the meaning will become clearer and clearer with experience=A0an=\r\nd the correct emotions will come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a m=\r\nantra everyday - possibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and=\r\n visualization in the mind - will slowly understand it and experience it.\n=\r\n=A0\nSome religions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emph=\r\nasizing philosophy and the final truths. While the latter is undeniably the=\r\n end goal, the former helps one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs=\r\n to set foot at the base of hill before reaching its top, one often needs t=\r\no engage in some external practices in order to realize internal truths. Of=\r\n course, it is good to remind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest o=\r\nne should get stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one cannot completel=\r\ny eliminate the first steps. Just saying &quot;you are That. Just realize that y=\r\nou are That&quot; is not an action plan. It does not work for most. One has to t=\r\nake some baby steps.\n=A0If we don&#39;t teach a toddler to say various words be=\r\ncause the toddler does not anyway understand them, one will never learn any=\r\nthing. Correct knowledge evolves from half knowledge and habits that may be=\r\n=A0devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Similarly,=\r\n correct spiritual knowledge evolves from half knowledge and ritualalistic =\r\npractices that may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experienc=\r\nes more. Most of us, when it comes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers=\r\n. So it is useful to get into the habit of doing things.

Many people engage in rituals without understanding what they are me=\r\nant for. One stuck in the material world needs to engage in actions using t=\r\nhe objects of material world as symbols and these symbols will eventually t=\r\nrigger the correct thinking in the mind. There are many priests who do a ni=\r\nce pooja or homam and then feel so proud about it. Actions engaged by one w=\r\nho is not making any effort to reduce the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; in those ac=\r\ntions are fruitless. As the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; comes down, one&#39;s actions=\r\n will have more nectar and less poison. Rituals and various actions engaged=\r\n by many people are poisoned by the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; and the associate=\r\nd pride. If a ritual is performed with a sense of surrender, then the ritua=\r\nl works and increases the surrender further.&nbsp;As surrender is increased=\r\n, ritual will\n become better. As ritual becomes better, surrender becomes b=\r\netter. One has to gain a sufficient level of internal purity in order to br=\r\neak through into the groove.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;One not realizing this=\r\n will continue to run after the irrelevant and useless.

But, the strong sense of I-ness and pride may poison everything a=\r\nnd take a long time for the person to make progress.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;This is why I keep emphasizing tha=\r\nt external rituals and internal transformation should go hand in hand.

For example, w=\r\ne tell small children to say &quot;thank you&quot; when someone helps or say &quot;I am so=\r\nrry&quot; when they do something wrong. A really small child does not even under=\r\nstand what those words mean, but repeats them out of habit. As the child gr=\r\nows up, one starts to understand the true meaning of what one has been sayi=\r\nng. In fact, an understanding of what they truly mean comes to one slowly a=\r\ns one grows. Many words are actually understood from experience. If a child=\r\n has never seen a mango or the picture of a mango, you cannot explain what =\r\na mango is by using hundred words. As a child accumulates more and more exp=\r\neriences (stored perceptions of the external world through senses), the chi=\r\nld&#39;s thinking expands and one gets more clarity on the words and concepts o=\r\nne has been exposed to. When one says sorry, one then clearly knows what ex=\r\nactly that means and may even feel a certain\n emotion (sadness and compassi=\r\non).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Similarly, one may be doing rituals like homam=\r\n, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without fully understanding o=\r\nr appreciating what one does.&nbsp;One doing a ritual for many years withou=\r\nt fully understanding its real meaning may slowly start to understand and e=\r\nven experience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and spi=\r\nritual truths are actually understood from experience alone.

A mere explanation of the symbolism is often usel=\r\ness to give one that state of bliss. Even if you explain to a one year old =\r\nchild what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means in detail, the child will not understand.=\r\n The best thing to do is to just get the child into the habit of saying &quot;I =\r\nam sorry&quot; in approapriate situations. Slowly, the meaning will become clear=\r\ner and clearer with experience&nbsp;and the correct emotions will come auto=\r\nmatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyday - possibly with mistak=\r\nes and without the correct meaning and visualization in the mind - will slo=\r\nwly understand it and experience it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Some religions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing =\r\nrituals and emphasizing philosophy and the final truths. While the latter i=\r\ns undeniably the end goal, the former helps one in getting to the latter. J=\r\nust as one needs to set foot at the base of hill before reaching its top, o=\r\nne often needs to engage in some external practices in order to realize int=\r\nernal truths. Of course, it is good to remind one that reaching the top is =\r\nthe goal, lest one should get stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one =\r\ncannot completely eliminate the first steps. Just saying &quot;you are That. Jus=\r\nt realize that you are That&quot; is not an action plan. It does not work for mo=\r\nst.
