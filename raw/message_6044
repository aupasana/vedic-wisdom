He got it from some source and started giving Ahutis with the Mantra=\r\n during his Maha-Ganapati Homam. As he has written, First day he had troubl=\r\nes in office and 2nd day his bike was stolen resulting in his shaken confid=\r\nence due to obvious worries.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking at the situation, IMHO, it is=\r\n very early to think about stopping the same. Though intentions for specifi=\r\ncally invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not known, I believe that it was for s=\r\nome or the other Saatwik desire (Even it may have been mundane and not spee=\r\nding up spiritual progress). Also, it defies the logic to attach incidences=\r\n to Homam with experiences of just a couple of days.\n&gt; &gt; For that matter, e=\r\nven Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if I take my own personal experiences.=\r\n I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati Homas as well as Chandi homas and I=\r\n have had many set backs and some good things as well but again those are a=\r\nll part & parcel of life. Even without Homam, one may experience such duali=\r\nstic situations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand your insistence and your prudent adv=\r\nice to worship Soumya Devatas and I agree to your logic which is most proba=\r\nbly out of your experiences, however I also think that Ugra Devata should n=\r\not be that fearful while Soumya Devatas are not that Goody-goody. Ultimatel=\r\ny, it is all about attraction/liking for a particular deity. It is my perso=\r\nnal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya D=\r\nevata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which one feels most attracted =\r\nand then forget about the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on mind =\r\nof a person to start judging and relating day to day experiences with homam=\r\n. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva or Ha=\r\nnuman or any other deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chosen dei=\r\nty, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts going wrong, one need not d=\r\nespair and should keep faith till it is impossible because if God exist, th=\r\nere never would be a breaking point and that holds true for all of us wheth=\r\ner we have families to look after or not.\n&gt; &gt; I completely tend to agree an=\r\nd hence repeat for benefits of others that Ganapati is not a Lower devata. =\r\nHe is capable of everything. If one has a great liking for him, one can kee=\r\np on performing his homam without need of switching. Actually to switch fro=\r\nm Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing of Levels (especi=\r\nally from Lower to upper) which some may think.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nUtpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The point raised by Biswa=\r\njit is a genuine one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress requires freedom from=\r\n the burden of some key blocking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas. One way to be free from a k=\r\narma is to experience the reaction to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it in full (in due course of t=\r\nime). Another way is to burn it in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana. When one meditates or he=\r\nlps people or engages in various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual practices also, some karm=\r\nas are getting burnt and being taken \n&gt; &gt; &gt; off one&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sad=\r\nhanas like homam accelerate that process. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam of ugra devatas acce=\r\nlerates it further. The distinction is between \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas and ug=\r\nra devatas is a very important one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I gave this analogy a few =\r\ntimes before. Suppose there is a basket \n&gt; &gt; &gt; containing fruits (your karm=\r\nas). Suppose a good fruit (good karma) is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck under some rotten fr=\r\nuits (bad karmas). When you do sadhana, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity (personification o=\r\nf certain good qualities within you, which are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being  strengthened a=\r\ns you do the sadhana) re-arranges the kaarmik \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of =\r\nthe analogy, some rotten fruits are taken out and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thrown in garbage =\r\nand the good fruit is given to you to eat. If this is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; done slowly an=\r\nd carefully, it takes longer to take the good fruit out, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but the spi=\r\nllage of rotten fruit pieces on the floor is minimized. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the =\r\nway of soumya devatas (gentle deities). If this is done fast and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; agg=\r\nressively, the good fruit comes out faster, but the spillage of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rott=\r\nen fruit pieces is more. This is the way of ugra devatas (fierce \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dei=\r\nties). It is a tradeoff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I=\r\n recommended before, those who want their material life to go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smooth=\r\nly and not in a hurry for spiritual progress should stick to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya =\r\ndevatas. Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vishnu, Krishna etc can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be w=\r\norshipped in fire. Once one starts worshipping fierce forms like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cha=\r\nndi, Durga, Narasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, especially in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfire, things CAN be too fast for them to handle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, it i=\r\ns a good idea to just stick to Ganapathi homam for a few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, bef=\r\nore starting to worship any other deity. There is no need to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be in a=\r\n hurry to &quot;graduate&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else. Ganapathi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is n=\r\now lower and is capable of giving everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people today do not understand Mahavidyas at all. For=\r\n example, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on literal meanings of some scriptural sayings, they=\r\n think that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bagalamukhi is for success over enemies and success in l=\r\nitigation etc. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people suggest specific Mahavidya sadhanas for m=\r\naterial benefits \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on horoscopic combinations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vidy=\r\na means knowledge. Mahavidya means supreme knowledge. No knowledge \n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhat enables one to win court cases or defeat enemies or to get other \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n temporary material results can be termed as &quot;supreme&quot; knowledge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nhavidyas are far more serious. They stand for different aspects of the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; knowledge of Self, which is the only supreme knowledge. They are the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; liberating forms of the divine Mother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people on eart=\r\nh today are unready for their worship. People today \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need deities who=\r\n can take care of material things and give some push \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually. Th=\r\nat&#39;s it. Serious liberating forces such as Mahavidyas are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inappropri=\r\nate for one who worries about little things. I mean no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disrespect - =\r\nworrying about little things is not unusual for most people \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and is o=\r\nk - but then think twice before worshipping Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; especially i=\r\nn a fruitful medium such as fire. Fire amplifies the impact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the m=\r\nantra and surrounding thoughts on the subtle body and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accelerates th=\r\ne results, compared to normal meditation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the above words carefully and skip ugra devatas and M=\r\nahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; atleast for a while in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, =\r\nin the beginning, some mistakes may be made. Just as Shiva drank \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n poison that came out first during the churning of milky ocean, Guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n gives protection in the beginning. If you have a spiritual guru, think \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; of him/her before the homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think o=\r\nf me or my guru Dr Manish Pandit. Better \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Sw=\r\nami (Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Gulwani Maharaj (Yo=\r\ngiraj Shri Vaman Rao Dattatreya Gulwani), Shri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj and M=\r\nanish Pandit. That is my Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, you can al=\r\nso think of Dattatreya or Krishna or Shiva as your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru based on you=\r\nr inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                  =\r\n  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Mar 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM, biswa108 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n   NAMASKAR\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, got the point... but my point is Whether I a=\r\nm ready for burning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kermik debit with this kind of speed...
