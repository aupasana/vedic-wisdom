I will try to rep=\r\nly soon in detail. This is one Upanishad where I am not too pleased with an=\r\ny existing commentary. \n=C2=A0\nAnyway, that particular verse needs to be un=\r\nderstood in the context of the verses before it. Interestingly, those verse=\r\ns touch upon some things we are discussing above and below! For example, on=\r\ne verse says that those who pursue no re-birth and non-existence reach a &quot;d=\r\nark region&quot; (i.e. not the effulgent light of Self), though those who are in=\r\nterested in a nice re-birth reach even darker regions.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n=C2=A0\nMoksha or liberation is lack of ANY wants. Though *wanting* a nice=\r\n existence (e.g. healthy body, intelligent mind, wealthy environment etc) i=\r\ns a bondage, so is *wanting* a non-existence or no re-birth, i.e. fear or a=\r\nversion for rebirth. Wanting not to be reborn is a want too! When the true =\r\nlight of Self shines unblocked in one, one does not view either death or de=\r\nathlessness or birth or birthlessness as better or worse.\n=C2=A0\nWhen one h=\r\nas no wants, one is liberated.

Thanks =\r\nfor explaining.=C2=A0 \n\n\nAs Narasimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irre=\r\nvocably linked. The &#39;status&#39; of the world is right in the middle of the two=\r\n. We are all looking at this from different points of view, based on our ow=\r\nn conditioning. \n\n\nI can&#39;t pull myself out of the dream analogy. All of us =\r\ndream. We are creators of the dream world, and it is our consciousness alon=\r\ne that forms the material for the dream world. Once created, a portion of o=\r\nurselves gets projected into the dream world, and we become subject to our =\r\nown maya. We interact with so many other created beings, and interact based=\r\n on the rules of this dream world. Inside the dream world, for the duration=\r\n of it&#39;s existence, everything appears true.=C2=A0 \n\n\nThe world that is cre=\r\nated is based on the thoughts that went through our mind at the moment we f=\r\nell into deep sleep. At some point, once we have experienced enough, we nat=\r\nurally wake up. We spend some time in the &quot;real world&quot;, and then the cycle =\r\nrepeats. \n\n\nOur experiences inside our created dream world have an impact o=\r\nn us when we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams and reflect=\r\n on them. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking state to some =\r\nextent, and then back into the next dream experience. \n\n\nBy looking at ever=\r\ny question from three points of time, we get three different answers. The d=\r\nream world is real for it&#39;s duration, unreal between cycles and is conditio=\r\nnally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is interacting with the worl=\r\nd with no attachment from inside the world; realizing the absolute unrealit=\r\ny of the world from outside; and is both of these when looking across cycle=\r\ns. \n\n\nFrom all points of view, the thinning of the accumulated conditioning=\r\n (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key. \n\n\nsasneham, \n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0=C2=A0 ajit \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 30, 2012 at 12:04 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt; rajarshi=\r\n14@...&gt; wrote: \n\n\nDear Ajit, \n\n&lt;Even if the play goes on,=C2=A0 dif=\r\nferent actors may play the part.&gt; \n\nInteresting.

This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the=C2=A0 story =\r\nso far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So=\r\n what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.&gt;&gt; \n\nAs per the Tantric s=\r\ncriptures, even Lord Shiva in=C2=A0 his form of Bhairava smokes ganja, drin=\r\nks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around naked in the smashan=\r\na. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to judge anyone&#39;s spiritu=\r\nality? Not for me! \n\n, \n\n&lt;&lt;what does God mean in this tale? &gt;&gt; \n\n\nI will te=\r\nll you how I see it. In this story, God means infinity. Now what is infinit=\r\ny? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot be understood usin=\r\ng the five sense organs. Science does not understand infinity, art=C2=A0 do=\r\nes not understand infinity, nothing or nobody=C2=A0 understands infinity. I=\r\nt is a summation of all that we know, all that we can=C2=A0 imagine and all=\r\n that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that=\r\n runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most despicable , f=\r\nrom the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupid=\r\nest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet=\r\n in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. \n\n\n\nNow question is=\r\n, can an average human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force=\r\n? Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact wit=\r\nh such a thing? One way is to consider=C2=A0 everything, and I mean EVERYTH=\r\nING from living to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus le=\r\narn to love the same unconditionally without expecting anything in return. =\r\nNo wonder such unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort t=\r\no change our own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases =\r\nand prejudices. That is what the=C2=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To wo=\r\nrk on oneself, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everyth=\r\ning. The greater number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much=\r\n little bit closer one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And=\r\n those few rare human beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally,=\r\n are possibly the closest to this supreme and unknowable\n force. In common =\r\nlanguage, we call them Rishis. \n\nI like all forms of=C2=A0 Deities, for I f=\r\nind something beautiful in everyone of them. And I also like the One behind=\r\n forms, which is so perfectly transcendental that it cannot be comprehended=\r\n ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap b=\r\netween the two breaths, or the millionth part of a single hair, or the endl=\r\ness-ness of space, or the bottomless well of stillness in the mind at certa=\r\nin points in meditation. The only thing that stops me from getting a better=\r\n understanding the grandeur of=C2=A0 this formless entity are the limitatio=\r\nns of my own mind and body, that I have acquired over millions of births. T=\r\nhat is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able t=\r\no appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d. \n\n\nI do not=C2=A0 believe =\r\nin Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the Universe itself gets born ove=\r\nr and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come back at every cycle, who am I =\r\nto demand that I should not get born? Infact, when a person proverbially fi=\r\nnishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to another plane in this Universe=\r\n and stay there for eons of time, since time anyway moves very, very slowly=\r\n in different realms. But then, if this force so wants, it can send back an=\r\ny of the souls from any of the realms to any of the other realms to serve a=\r\n certain function. And if a soul stays in a certain higher realm and in for=\r\nced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the karmas - which never really die=\r\n off - are=C2=A0 watered again by the environment of birth and they sprout =\r\ninto saplings. And this may go even beyond one cycle of creation. Else why =\r\nwould Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same enemies that they had been figh=\r\nting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata says\n so. I=C2=A0 believe i=\r\nt. \n\n\n\nWhat then is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don&#39;t kn=\r\now. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequentially less=\r\nen our attachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems.=\r\n This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local melas. Tighten=\r\n the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detached and enjoy the show=\r\n! \n\n\nBest of luck and take good care of yourself! \n\n\n-Regards \n=C2=A0Rajars=\r\nhi \n\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \nparam bhAwamajAnant=\r\no mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n\n\n___________________________________ \n\nFro=\r\nm: Laxmi Narayan &lt; shrijishrihari@...&gt; \nTo: &quot; vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;=C2=A0 &lt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Saturday, 28 July 201=\r\n2 7:30 PM \nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=\r\n=99t believe in any religion \n\n=C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi Bhai, \nHow are you? You=\r\n have to complete the story. you have to tell what happened when X went to =\r\nmeet this man in temple.or anything else which happened.

If people do not believe in religion or God or afterli=\r\nfe, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do not come from same=\r\n stock. We are born with different conditions, go through different life ex=\r\nperiences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. This world is composed=\r\n of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of different sort. Why=C2=\r\n=A0 blame it on religion or God, why not on greed and desire to control oth=\r\ners and lord over them using what ever mean. \n\n\nThis story seems to=C2=A0 l=\r\nike I used to read in Chandamama.

After all there was a dhoni fi=\r\nre there? Or some other God ?? \n\n\nSri Vrindavan has a rolling population.=\r\n=C2=A0 They are not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosity=\r\n, many other come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. ma=\r\nny others come with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a pe=\r\nrson who is in fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade. \n\n\nMany times p=\r\neople go to temple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not ha=\r\nppen they become very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothing =\r\nto do with me or you or anybody else. It is their life. \n\n\nI was very very =\r\nvery=C2=A0 ill. Nobody was helping me.

Late=\r\nly I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychological constructs are cr=\r\neated by religions to protect an average person from the real experience of=\r\n God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if and when it happens, it=\r\n can effectively cause a hurricane in your average life and pretty much des=\r\ntroy all your well laid plans. \n\n\n\nI will briefly narrate a true and intere=\r\nsting incident. \n\n\n\nAn individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 =\r\nstay there for some=C2=A0 years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sa=\r\ndhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unbli=\r\nnking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at th=\r\ne satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged =\r\nlooking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tel=\r\nl us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why=\r\n waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will=\r\n run away. So please=C2=A0 continue with your lectures as you were doing be=\r\nfore I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhi=\r\nle the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the s=\r\nky and then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu wh=\r\no was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes=\r\n to Vrindavan once in a\n while, but he has probably lost his mental balance=\r\n due to smoking too much=C2=A0 ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for so=\r\nme weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where=\r\n the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned=\r\n around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to c=\r\nome and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to sp=\r\neak in English and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he=\r\n knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). \n\n\n=\r\n\nThe man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an=\r\n Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering =\r\nsadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing =\r\nthe satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thin=\r\ng itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of S=\r\nadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all=C2=\r\n=A0 the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, =\r\n&quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you h=\r\nave been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine s=\r\nadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take=C2=A0 V=\r\nrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confuse=\r\nd as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot me=\r\net that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The ro=\r\not\n of all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man=\r\n cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human=\r\n brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a =\r\nmagnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, o=\r\nne day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may=\r\n even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regar=\r\nded=C2=A0 by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I =\r\nsay the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a fin=\r\nite mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talki=\r\nng, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja,=C2=A0 and=\r\n in one pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for=\r\n about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continu=\r\ned, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t=\r\n get\n confused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. Wh=\r\nen I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of=\r\n youth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew=\r\n up. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roami=\r\nng for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact =\r\nwith this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, wo=\r\nman and a=C2=A0 young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside a=\r\nnd Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a=\r\n lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you som=\r\nething interesting if you join me. \n\n\n\nAfter an hour inside the house, X wa=\r\ns feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits=\r\n and sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s =\r\nfeet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man =\r\nis one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shameles=\r\nsly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As=\r\n soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman a=\r\nnd the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards t=\r\nhe cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing =\r\nthe opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see=C2=A0 what was goi=\r\nng on. What he saw made his jaw drop=C2=A0 open in shock. Instead of the ol=\r\nd, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young ma=\r\nn, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, =\r\nemanating a brilliant glow that lightened up\n the whole room. He had a shav=\r\ned head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful =\r\neyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of wh=\r\nat was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar. \n\n\n\nX=\r\n did not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him=\r\n to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and wal=\r\nked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousnes=\r\ns. When he woke up,=C2=A0 he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location=\r\n with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand=\r\n and took him inside the temple precincts.=C2=A0 There he saw a dhuni burni=\r\nng, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all ov=\r\ner his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man=\r\n to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking ab=\r\nout, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan=\r\n currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing direction=\r\ns of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immed=\r\niately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into\n uncon=\r\nsciousness again. \n\n\n\nWhen X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lyi=\r\nng on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mi=\r\nschievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as directed. \n\n=\r\n\n\n-Regards \n=C2=A0Rajarshi \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE=C2=A0=\r\n mAmabuddhayah | \nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n\n\n____=\r\n_______________________________ \n\nFrom: Ajit Krishnan &lt; ajit.krishnan@gmail=\r\n.com&gt; \nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012=C2=A0 8:=\r\n13 AM \nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t=\r\n believe in any religion \n\n=C2=A0 Dear Prasanth, \n\n\n&gt; To those who say that=\r\n they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n\n\n\n\nIn general, many of those =\r\nwho don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more honest than=C2=A0 those=\r\n who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limited=\r\n being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent =\r\nwhen dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize =\r\nthese biases. \n\n\nWhile being mired in this word of duality, we think that a=\r\nn ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we en=\r\ngage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that=\r\n others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of=\r\n God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n\n\nWe all have plenty of paapa an=\r\nd punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be st=\r\neadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and =\r\nleave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, i=\r\ngnoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya ph=\r\nala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial observ=\r\ner sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the cul=\r\nprit. \n\n\nFor the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spir=\r\nitual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds =\r\nand minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti=C2=A0 is strong, =\r\nand time really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual =\r\nbhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it =\r\nfor what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n\n\nTh=\r\ne best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-be=\r\nlievers&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our=\r\n lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselve=\r\ns, the world will be served. \n\n\nIf we see God as the limitless=C2=A0 power =\r\nthat he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him withi=\r\nn a religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should as=\r\nk each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the highe=\r\nr goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without questi=\r\non.

I will try to reply s=\r\noon in detail.

Interesting=\r\nly, those verses touch upon some things we are discussing above and below! =\r\nFor example, one verse says that those who pursue no re-birth and non-exist=\r\nence reach a &quot;dark region&quot; (i.e. not the effulgent light of Self), though t=\r\nhose who are interested in a nice re-birth reach even darker regions.&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;=\r\nVerdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font co=\r\nlor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font\n color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Moksha or li=\r\nberation is lack of ANY wants. Though *wanting* a nice existence (e.g. heal=\r\nthy body, intelligent mind, wealthy environment etc) is a bondage, so is *w=\r\nanting* a non-existence or no re-birth, i.e. fear or aversion for rebirth. =\r\nWanting not to be reborn is a want too! When the true light of Self shines =\r\nunblocked in one, one does not view either death or deathlessness or birth =\r\nor birthlessness as better or worse.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font =\r\ncolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;When one has =\r\nno wants, one is liberated.

For some=\r\n reasons I had to spend nearly the whole day studying parts of Mahabharata =\r\nand other literature on Krishna - not exactly from a devotional perspective=\r\n - but rather for an objective understand of the man that was Krishna. And =\r\nthen I realized - actually it was like a epiphany, a sudden burst of clarit=\r\ny in&nbsp; the mind - moksha is not about going to some other plane, or not=\r\n taking rebirth (which too can happen), ETC. It is infact making our awaren=\r\ness free from the chains which bind it, namely the 8\n snares, and thus dist=\r\nort it. Had moksha been something reserved for another world and another sp=\r\nace and time, then a being like Krishna would not have bothered to come dow=\r\nn to earth and do the things He did, in the manner He did. What a Hero! It&=\r\nnbsp; is through life itself that one must gain freedom, else the whole wor=\r\nld and everything in it is meaningless, and everybody should have then stop=\r\nped doing everything and waited for death to transport us to some other hoa=\r\nry realm. &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;=\r\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;=\r\nVerdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;A happy&nbsp; Janmasthami to whoever is reading this ma=\r\nil. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;font\n color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;-Regards &lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;=\r\n#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00=\r\n0000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam sar=\r\nanam vraja aham tvam sarva-papebhyo mokshayisyami ma sucah. - Gita 18.66&nb=\r\nsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;____=\r\n_______________________________&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv\n align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fr=\r\nom: &lt;/b&gt;Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div ali=\r\ngn=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To: &lt;/b&gt;ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;=\r\n#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sent: &lt;/b&gt;Thursday, 2 August 2012 7:0=\r\n6 PM &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject: &lt;/b&gt;Re:&nbsp; [vedic-wisdom] Moksha &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D=\r\n&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; Dear Raja=\r\nrshi, &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0=\r\n00000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000=\r\n&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;I had to re-read this a few times, but I thin=\r\nk I&#39;m finally understanding what you are trying to convey.

The &#39;status&#39; of the world is right in the middl=\r\ne of the two. We are all looking at this from different points of view, bas=\r\ned on our own conditioning. &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;I can&#39;t pull myself out =\r\nof the dream analogy. All of us dream. We are creators of the dream world, =\r\nand it is our consciousness alone that forms the material for the dream wor=\r\nld. Once created, a portion of ourselves gets projected into the dream worl=\r\nd, and we become subject to our\n own maya. We interact with so many other c=\r\nreated beings, and interact based on the rules of this dream world. Inside =\r\nthe dream world, for the duration of it&#39;s existence, everything appears tru=\r\ne.&nbsp; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;The world that is created is based on the t=\r\nhoughts that went through our mind at the moment we fell into deep sleep. A=\r\nt some point, once we have experienced enough, we naturally wake up. We spe=\r\nnd some time in the &quot;real world&quot;, and then the cycle repeats. &lt;font face=3D=\r\n&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verd=\r\nana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Our experiences inside our created dream world have an impact\n on=\r\n us when we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams and reflect =\r\non them. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking state to some e=\r\nxtent, and then back into the next dream experience. &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;=\r\n&gt;By looking at every question from three points of time, we get three diffe=\r\nrent answers. The dream world is real for it&#39;s duration, unreal between cyc=\r\nles and is conditionally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is intera=\r\ncting with the world with no attachment from inside the world; realizing th=\r\ne absolute unreality of the world from outside; and is both of these when l=\r\nooking across cycles. &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;From all points of view, th=\r\ne thinning of the accumulated conditioning (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key. &lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;=\r\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;=\r\nVerdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;sasneham, &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\najit &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;font face=3D&quot;=\r\nArial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0=\r\n00000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font\n color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LE=\r\nFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul 30, 201=\r\n2 at 12:04 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt; &lt;font color=3D&quot;#3333FF&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font co=\r\nlor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Dear Ajit, &lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#3333FF&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font co=\r\nlor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#3333FF&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nof=\r\nollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D=\r\n&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;Even if the play goes on,&nbsp; different actors m=\r\nay play the part.&gt; &lt;font\n color=3D&quot;#3333FF&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;=\r\n3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#3333FF&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; =\r\nsize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEF=\r\nT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Interesting.

It exists not just in the physi=\r\ncal universe, but even in other non-physical states, though the degree mayb=\r\ne different. Is the average waking consciousness real? Yes. Are higher/diff=\r\nerent states of awareness real? Yes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0=\r\n00000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Everything, from the physical world to n=\r\non-physical realms exist and is an extension of the Supreme. Maya is nothin=\r\ng more than whatever obstructs an individual&#39;s mind from realizing that inh=\r\nerent unity. From an individual (human entity) perspective, the point of ma=\r\nximum stillness is the Purusha, what is called atmah/soul, and everything e=\r\nlse, from points of lesser stillness\n to the external objective reality is =\r\nShakti. Extending this principle to the Universe, the purely transcendental=\r\n non-changing, non-negotiable reality can be called the &quot;atmah&quot; while every=\r\nthing else, semi-transcendental to the objective&nbsp; reality all around i=\r\ns Shakti. Thus in short, using scriptural terms, Nirguna Brahman is the sta=\r\nte of mind of God, while the Universe(s)/various realm(s) is the body of Go=\r\nd. Both are irrevocable linked for all practical purposes.&nbsp; Maya is wh=\r\natever inhibits an individual cell (a human being or animal or plant or any=\r\nthing) in the body of the God - that is Universe(s) - from realizing the gr=\r\neater picture. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;
