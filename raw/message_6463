It =\r\nis a powerful tool and if you notice the stotra you will find worship being=\r\n done at the Nine enclosures of the sri chakra and the forms of the goddess=\r\n at each enclosure and triangle.\n\nIt is a misconception to think traditiona=\r\nl worship done in temples is the sattvic form and tantric worship is worshi=\r\np of the tamasic form. Both are one and the same ,just materials having bee=\r\nn substituted.\n\nIf you wish to read this is an nice document on the Khadgam=\r\nala stotra from Devipuram . They do a really good job of dispelling some of=\r\n the myths around devi worship and also have thrown open the doors of devi =\r\nworship to one and all.\n\nOne is an audio link with Amritananda Natha Sarasw=\r\nati himself chanting it.His voice is mesmerizing and soothing.The other is =\r\nthe stotra with meanings of each round of the stotra.\n\nhttp://old.devipuram=\r\n.com/downloads/khadgamala_stotram.html\n\nwww.shaktisadhana.org/images/Khadga=\r\nmala/KSFINAL.doc\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks for making it all clear, its very fine, but extremely imp=\r\nortant. summarizing for myself\n&gt; 1.

Then \n&gt; &gt; it is ok to dig in seve=\r\nral places to become familiar with digging.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though one may special=\r\nize in one subject in higher studies, one learns \n&gt; &gt; many subjects at a yo=\r\nung age. But, eventually you have to focus on one \n&gt; &gt; subject. Similarly, =\r\nworshipping several deities with several mantras is \n&gt; &gt; ok in the beginnin=\r\ng.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My thumb rule is this: Leave all mantras and stick to one, if y=\r\nou feel \n&gt; &gt; comfortable with it. If you feel guilty and uncomfortable, the=\r\nn you are \n&gt; &gt; probably not ready yet and so keep doing your entire routine=\r\n. But start \n&gt; &gt; focusing on one mantra and do more of it, i.e. do others f=\r\nor a small \n&gt; &gt; duration and spend most doing one mantra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We do no=\r\nt have perfect enough knowledge of astrology to rely on it. If \n&gt; &gt; you go =\r\nto ten astrologers, you will get 5-8 different advices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moon and M=\r\nars in 6th in taamasik Sc can give you victory over enemies \n&gt; &gt; (including=\r\n internal), if you worshoip Chandi. But lagna lord Mercury is \n&gt; &gt; super-st=\r\nrong and shows Vishnu. Saturn shows ascetic and Sun shows Rama. \n&gt; &gt; So, Su=\r\nn-Saturn-Mercury combination to me shows Rama in an ascetic form \n&gt; &gt; durin=\r\ng vanavas. Worship Rama. Develop the HanumadBhava (think and act \n&gt; &gt; like =\r\nHanuman) and worship Rama. It can make both Mars and Mercury in own \n&gt; &gt; ho=\r\nuses work strongly in your chart.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;    =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;             =\r\n       http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;       Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On T=\r\nhu, Jun 2, 2011 at 4:10 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Namaste nar=\r\nasimha,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does make sense to read 10 strotras for 5-6 dieties daily.=\r\n Which is \n&gt; &gt; better addressing problem/trait/duality directly or Devotion=\r\n to ishta \n&gt; &gt; devata?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of late doing khadagamala st=\r\nrotra, i felt and realized different kind of \n&gt; &gt; energy.
