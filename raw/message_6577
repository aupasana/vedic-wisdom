I\n&gt;&gt; want to make some more comments on recent posts in this series. So=\r\nme of\n&gt;&gt; the strong points made in this series have a potential to mislead =\r\nand\n&gt;&gt; instill wrong notions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The arguments of the karma-kandins are not sound. For there cannot be\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any motive\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or desire to act when there is the knowledge of the hi=\r\nghest truth. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; does not find\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any use in the performance of karma=\r\n. When one gets a desire to know\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the atman which\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This notion tha=\r\nt the paths of karma (action) and gyaana/jnaana\n&gt;&gt; (knowledge) oppose each =\r\nother is one of the major misconceptions of\n&gt;&gt; contemporary Vedic knowledge=\r\n. I found the same thinking at WAVES (World\n&gt;&gt; Association of Vedic Studies=\r\n) conference in Aug 2010. Some Vedic\n&gt;&gt; scholars talk about vedanta and kno=\r\nwledge. Some talk about karma and\n&gt;&gt; actions/rituals. They think that those=\r\n are two opposing paths.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Vasishtha very clearly said at the beginning=\r\n of &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that\n&gt;&gt; the bird of individual self flies into the s=\r\nky of undivided and infinite\n&gt;&gt; consciousness, by flapping the two wings of=\r\n karma and gyaana. A bird\n&gt;&gt; cannot fly with just one wing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Knowledge=\r\n without action to rid oneself of the blocking conditioning\n&gt;&gt; cannot free =\r\none. Without actions, knowledge remains merely intellectual.\n&gt;&gt; Only with r=\r\nepeated actions does knowledge get ingrained in one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; consciousness so d=\r\neeply that all of one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and deeds\n&gt;&gt; are shaped by that=\r\n correct knowledge (instead of underlying\n&gt;&gt; conditioning). Just &quot;knowing&quot; =\r\nintellectually that a movie is not real\n&gt;&gt; and there is no need to take wha=\r\nt happens on the screen seriously is not\n&gt;&gt; enough to stop you from getting=\r\n startled when a really scary scene comes\n&gt;&gt; in the movie! You need to prac=\r\ntice a lot before that knowledge becomes\n&gt;&gt; natural and permanent and you s=\r\ntop getting startled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Similarly, actionss without knowledge are usele=\r\nss too. One keeps\n&gt;&gt; performing actions forever then. One watching a movie =\r\n1000 times without\n&gt;&gt; the knowledge that it is unreal and should not be tak=\r\nen seriously will\n&gt;&gt; get startled each time and enjoy the experience.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n In http://tinyurl.com/homamwhy document (from WAVES 2010 conference), I\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n gave an analogy. Suppose one needs to walk to the top of a mountain. One\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; with gyaana but no karma is like a person standing at the base and\n&gt;&gt; sta=\r\nring at the pinnacle. He knows where to go, but he will remain at the\n&gt;&gt; ba=\r\nse forever. One with karma but no gyaana is like a person going around\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe mountain forever. One balancing karma and gyana, i.e. engaging in\n&gt;&gt; act=\r\nions cocupled with the correct understanding that all is Brahman, is\n&gt;&gt; lik=\r\ne a person climbing the mountain and watching the top from time to\n&gt;&gt; time =\r\nto correct one&#39;s course. He will eventually reach the pinnacle.\n&gt;&gt; Karma an=\r\nd gyaana need to go hand in hand and are definitely not\n&gt;&gt; opposites or alt=\r\nernatives.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is free from all the faults of samsaraf samsara, one doe=\r\ns not find any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; benefit out\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of actions which he has done or which =\r\nhe has to do.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actions with attachment (i.e. actions with agyaana) can=\r\n be criticized\n&gt;&gt; and dismissed. But detached actions (i.e. actions with gy=\r\naana) should be\n&gt;&gt; encouraged.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; This equating of liberation and spiritual progress with akarma\n&gt;&gt; (inac=\r\ntion), instead of detached action (nishkaama karma), is what led to\n&gt;&gt; the =\r\ntemporary downfall of Sanatana Dharma in the world. This is\n&gt;&gt; pseudo-Vedan=\r\nta and not the real deal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as you self-identify with a body, d=\r\nesires arise from time to\n&gt;&gt; time. The purer your conditioning is, the more=\r\n dharmik those desires\n&gt;&gt; will be. Perform the best action within your capa=\r\nbility to fulfil those\n&gt;&gt; desires. Once action is done, surrender it to the=\r\n Lord and do not think\n&gt;&gt; about it anymore. Whatever result comes, take it =\r\nas God&#39;s will and do\n&gt;&gt; not regret or rejoice. No pride and no shame. As yo=\r\nu do this more and\n&gt;&gt; more, your conditioning will drop more and more and y=\r\nour consciousness\n&gt;&gt; will become purer and purer. Your conscience will spea=\r\nk louder and\n&gt;&gt; louder and your sense of dharma will be refined. Your desir=\r\nes will\n&gt;&gt; become more and more dharmik. You will transition from fulfillin=\r\ng dharma\n&gt;&gt; towards individual self to fulfilling dharma towards universal =\r\nself.\n&gt;&gt; Eventually, you will reach a stage where you perform actions with =\r\nno\n&gt;&gt; identification. Then action become non-action.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, r=\r\nishis etc also do not engage in inaction. Instead, they\n&gt;&gt; engage in detach=\r\ned action for maintaining and supporting the Cosmic\n&gt;&gt; Order, as determined=\r\n by the Supreme Cosmic Being and His Shakti (his\n&gt;&gt; Kinetic aspect).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One acts only when there is des=\r\nire. A desireless man, whose desires\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fulfilled, who has=\r\n risen above desires, whose desire is the atman, has\n&gt;&gt; &gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; necessity=\r\n to act.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First of all, everybody whose self-identification with a bod=\r\ny remains\n&gt;&gt; atleast to a small extent IS performing actions continually. A=\r\nt the bare\n&gt;&gt; minimum, one performs actions like breathing, eating, drinkin=\r\ng water,\n&gt;&gt; urinating and defecating, which affect the lives of millions of=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; micro-organisms.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Second, one &quot;whose desire is the atman&quot; still ne=\r\neds to perform actions\n&gt;&gt; to fulfil that desire and be established in atman=\r\n always. Running away\n&gt;&gt; from actions and samsara will not free one from sa=\r\nmsara.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sannyasa is absolu=\r\ntely necessary whether it be vividisha-sannyasa or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vidvat-sannyasa.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Without perfect renunciation it is impossible to pursue the path of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Brahmavidya. ...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it is foolish to cite instances of Janaka and others=\r\n who did not take\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sannyasa but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; possessed Brahmajnana. Such instan=\r\nces are quoted by householders who\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are unwilling\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to leave their a=\r\nttachments, for there is no reason why they should\n&gt;&gt; &gt; stick to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; house=\r\nhold life after attaining knowledge. For knowledge by its very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nature =\r\nis\n&gt;&gt; &gt; against all senses of worldly duty and activity.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, many pe=\r\nople who quote such examples may indeed be unwilling to\n&gt;&gt; leave their atta=\r\nchments and take sannyasa. However, it is not correct to\n&gt;&gt; think that exte=\r\nrnal sannyasa is a must for Self-knowledge. In fact,\n&gt;&gt; Vasishtha gave so m=\r\nany criteria and paths towards Self-knowledge in\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, but=\r\n did not say that you have take sannyasa.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In fact, there is an intere=\r\nsting story given by Vasishtha in that\n&gt;&gt; Vedanta epic. See the story of Ch=\r\nudala and Sikhidhwaja. King Sikhidhwaja\n&gt;&gt; leaves his wife and kingdom, bec=\r\nomes an ascetic, lives in a small hut in\n&gt;&gt; a forest for a few decades and =\r\nspends all his time in meditation. Wife\n&gt;&gt; Chudala rules kingdom on behalf =\r\nof her husband and becomes\n&gt;&gt; Self-realized. She later helps her husband in=\r\n realization! So much for\n&gt;&gt; sannyasa being &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; for Brah=\r\nmavidya!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The sannyasin ca=\r\nn find adequate leisure and freedom from the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; distractions of life.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Renunciation is desirable even to those who have not attained jnana.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Only the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sannyasin can devote the whole time for meditation. Househol=\r\nders\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cannot give\n&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves up completely for meditation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; :=\r\n-) If one can find some focus despire the distractions, one progresses\n&gt;&gt; f=\r\naster. If one has no jnana and mind tends to get distracted, then\n&gt;&gt; sannya=\r\nsa may not help that much. Merely having more free time will not\n&gt;&gt; allow o=\r\nne to focus on god. One will get all kinds of thoughts when\n&gt;&gt; meditating.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, we see sannyasins getting caught engaging in sexual\n&gt;&gt; s=\r\ncandals and political scandals now-a-days. We see sannyasins fighting\n&gt;&gt; am=\r\nong themselves cheaply, to become the heads of their mathas\n&gt;&gt; (monasteries=\r\n). We see sannyasins trying to raise their profile among\n&gt;&gt; devotees and po=\r\nliticians or to get better TRPs on TV. We see sannyasins\n&gt;&gt; running after s=\r\niddhis and talking about siddhis like a child may talk\n&gt;&gt; about chocolates.=\r\n We see sannyasins trying to raise a lot of money for\n&gt;&gt; their mathas and r=\r\nesorting to cheap gimmicks for it. When people not\n&gt;&gt; ready for sannyasa an=\r\nd having dense conditioning take up sannyasa to\n&gt;&gt; have more &quot;leisure&quot; or e=\r\nscape from &quot;the distractions of life&quot;, this is\n&gt;&gt; what happens!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Remai=\r\nn in the material world and do sadhana. Develop detachment from\n&gt;&gt; body and=\r\n individual needs, compassion to others, dispassion and\n&gt;&gt; detachment in ac=\r\ntions, surrender to the Lord and the ability to engage\n&gt;&gt; in powerful actio=\r\nns while being absolutely prepared for any end result.\n&gt;&gt; As you make progr=\r\ness, perhaps oneday you will be ready for sannyasa and\n&gt;&gt; it will just happ=\r\nen. Or perhaps you will become realized even without\n&gt;&gt; sannyasa. In either=\r\n case, the end goal is internal detachment and\n&gt;&gt; self-realization and not =\r\nexternal renunciation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anybody who tells you that a *specific* extern=\r\nal action or object is a\n&gt;&gt; *must* for internal purification and liberation=\r\n is over-selling it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With=\r\nout abandonment of the concerns of worldly life, knowledge cannot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be p=\r\nursued\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with unabated vigor and devotion. It does not mean that the san=\r\nnyasin\n&gt;&gt; &gt; undervalues\n&gt;&gt; &gt; human society and discards all men without hel=\r\nping them at all. As the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; life of a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sannyasin is meant only to rea=\r\nch the highest Reality, and as he has\n&gt;&gt; &gt; already passed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; through the =\r\nlower stages of spiritual evolution, he may appear to be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not working\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; for the rest of humanity at large; but it is to be borne in mind that\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; he exercises\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a silent and unnoticed but powerful influence for the=\r\n good of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; public. That\n&gt;&gt; &gt; itself is the service he is rendering t=\r\no the society and that is the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; highest and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the most beneficent ser=\r\nvice that one could ever do to man. One who is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; intent upon\n&gt;&gt; &gt; realiz=\r\ning the peace, the bliss, the One Without a Second=C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot;Shantam,\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Shivam,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Advaitam=C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot;is the most powerful and the usef=\r\nul friend of the world!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Correct. But, not every sannyasin may have en=\r\nough &quot;spiritual evolution&quot;\n&gt;&gt; to exert such &quot;powerful influence for the goo=\r\nd of the public&quot;. The\n&gt;&gt; question here is not whether one has renounced X, =\r\nY, Z external things\n&gt;&gt; or not. The question is whether one has renounced e=\r\ngo, doership of one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; actions and surrendered to the Supreme Cosmic Bein=\r\ng completely or not.\n&gt;&gt; One who has, whoever he is and wherever he is, has =\r\na highly purified\n&gt;&gt; consciousness and exerts a powerful subtle influence o=\r\nn the world.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0Free Jyotish Software, =\r\nFree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 Spirituality: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Tw=\r\nitter ID: @homam108\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have great respect f=\r\nor Swami Sivananda and commentary on &quot;Yoga\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham&quot; by his discipl=\r\ne Swami Venkatesananda is one of my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; favorite books.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; However,=\r\n I want to put my foot down and record my exception to some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ideas expr=\r\nessed in this series.

One can renounc=\r\ne if one wants.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But, why belittle family members and call them leeches=\r\n?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If one&#39;s wife wants to cling to one, because of her conditionin=\r\ng and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual evolution, it is fine. She is not necessarily a bad pe=\r\nrson\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or a &quot;leech&quot;. If one engages in dharmik and unselfish actions to =\r\nmake\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s wife happy in various ways, as far as possible, it is not b=\r\nad\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and does not imply an undesirable attachment. If one *expects*\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n something from wife in return, THAT expectation is bad. THAT\n&gt;&gt; &gt; expectat=\r\nion of something back from wife is a leech that sucks blood\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from one&#39;s=\r\n soul.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Seeing the world, people and objects as obstructions or te=\r\nmptations or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;leeches&quot; is silly. Being disgusted with the world is as =\r\nmuch an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attachment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated with=\r\n it!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; World and people can exist and act in ways that may be natural to=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; them. Whatever they do, they are never the problem or blockage for\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; your own spiritual evolution. You may do various actions and give\n&gt;&gt; &gt; v=\r\narious things to various people, based on kaarmik debts, and nothing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; y=\r\nou do is necessarily a bondage. Actions never bind you, it is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; expectat=\r\nion of specific results from those actions that binds you.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Give freely=\r\n and magnanimously; and take whatever comes back naturally,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with no ex=\r\ncitement and no regret. Remove ANY expectation that may\n&gt;&gt; &gt; exist in your =\r\nmind, from ANYONE, and become completely free. THAT is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; true sannyasa o=\r\nr renunciation, not seeing people as leeches that cling\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on to you.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If one becomes a sannyasin because one is fed up with the world, it =\r\nis\n&gt;&gt; &gt; probably a bad idea. When one discharges most of one&#39;s duties and\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; responsibilities to others, a sense of genuine renunciation will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; n=\r\naturally develop. If one runs away from the world prematurely, Nature\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nwill drag one back later.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; When Adi Shankara renounced, his mother was very sad. But Adi Shanka=\r\nra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; did not see her as a leech. In fact, when she was on deathbed, he c=\r\name\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all the way back and did her final rites himself, though that was\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; completely against the traditional notions of sannyasa dharma. There\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; is a big lesson in this.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Actions and paying off your debts do=\r\n not bind you. In fact, inaction\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and pushing off a debt to future MAY =\r\nbind you! It is expectation in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what you do and egoistic attachment to =\r\nwhat you do (feeling proud or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ashamed) is what binds you.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is only when you take sanny=\r\nasa that they will leave\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you free.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Even to a sannyasin, man=\r\ny people may cling. They may come for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge or wisdom or to fulfil=\r\n their pride related to doing good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; religious work. So many people clun=\r\ng to Vivekananda and other monastic\n&gt;&gt; &gt; disciples of Ramakrishna. If one e=\r\nxpects something back from such\n&gt;&gt; &gt; followers, well-wishers and disciples =\r\n(e.g. admiration, learning well,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spreading knowledge or message in the=\r\n world, giving money for the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; religious order, etc), there is no differ=\r\nence really between wife and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; children and them. In other words, attach=\r\nment can form and bind you.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What binds you is your attitude towar=\r\nds people and your expectations\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from people and NOT how much people li=\r\nke you and how attached THEY are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to you. To be free, you do not need p=\r\neople to &quot;leave you free&quot;. You\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can be surrounded by thousands of peopl=\r\ne who are attached to you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; heavily and yet you can be free. Their attac=\r\nhment binds *them*. To be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; free, have no attachment and no expectations=\r\n. Give other whatever your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; body, mind and soul allow you to give. Have=\r\n no expctations of getting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; anythying back. Take whatever comes back by=\r\n itself. Simple!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; W=\r\nhen you fall sick You will be tempted to go in for their help and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vic=\r\ne versa.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Vice versa&quot; is not a problem. Taking care of a sick per=\r\nson if one is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; able to, whether it is wife or parents or children or so=\r\nmeone else, is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not binding. If there is an expectation of a return fav=\r\nor, THEN it is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; binding.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding taking help: Expecting any=\r\nthing from anyone causes bondage,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but taking what comes by itself, wit=\r\nh neither excitement nor regret,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; does not cause bondage. Ma Sarada nic=\r\nely demonstrated this once.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; When Swami Yogananda was badly sick, =\r\nMa Sarada asked his erstwhile\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wife (before sannyasa!) to come and serv=\r\ne him. That is so\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unconventional! Swami Yogananda protested saying it =\r\nwill set a bad\n&gt;&gt; &gt; example. But Swami Yogananda did not have any expectati=\r\nons and this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was done voluntarily by his wife (or under the instructio=\r\nn of Ma\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sarada, but not due to any expectations or pressure from Yogan=\r\nanda).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; After Yogananda overcame his reservations, he was neither excit=\r\ned nor\n&gt;&gt; &gt; regretful. He accepted the service equanomously and not worryin=\r\ng about\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what others will think or say.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, if one puts =\r\npressure on oneself and wants to prove to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; world how good one&#39;s ren=\r\nunciation us, THAT may be an attachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Expecting&quot; the world to see =\r\none&#39;s renunciation and appreciate one (or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not criticize one) is a very=\r\n subtle attachment. Ma Sarada may have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; detected a subtle attachment an=\r\nd put Swami Yogananda in a spot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; intentionally and made him overcome th=\r\ne attachment. Great teachers\n&gt;&gt; &gt; like Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada teach subt=\r\nle and valuable lessons in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; practical way. It may not even be obvious=\r\n to onlookers that there was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a lesson there! This is how sadgurus oper=\r\nate..\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Being able to=\r\n renounce wife, children, parents, siblings, house, car\n&gt;&gt; &gt; etc is a great=\r\n thing. But, if one thinks that those are &quot;all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; connections and ties&quot; t=\r\nhat bind one, one is badly mistaken. Those are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the gross ones - the ex=\r\nternal ones. The biggest bondage is internal.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The identification with =\r\na body and identification with a subtle\n&gt;&gt; &gt; individual identity (e.g. the =\r\nnotion that one is Narasimha, an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; engineer, a scholar, an astrologer et=\r\nc) are much stronger bondages\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than any others.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If one&#39;s hand=\r\ns or legs are cut off or if a tiger is eating one alive\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or if one is s=\r\nuffering from a terrible disease, can one focus the mind\n&gt;&gt; &gt; on god and no=\r\nt think of the body and its suffering? If one thinks &quot;*I*\n&gt;&gt; &gt; am suffering=\r\n&quot; and starts weeping, is one really free?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If someone praises a sa=\r\nnnyasin for his renunciation, devotion to god,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wisdom or spiritual att=\r\nainment, will no sannyasin feel even a little\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pride? If so, is one rea=\r\nlly free?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If a sannayasin does sadhana and experiences some speci=\r\nal things or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gets some siddhis, will it not give a little bit of pride=\r\n or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; satisfaction? If so, is one really free?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Focusing so hea=\r\nvily on external renunciation and making external\n&gt;&gt; &gt; objects of attachmen=\r\nt seem like a major thing, while ignoring the real\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attachment inside o=\r\nne (the sense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;these are mine&quot;),\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is like beating up=\r\n a tiger cub and feeling proud of the achievement,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; while ignoring the =\r\nbig tiget just lurking behind one and waiting to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pounce on one!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me say one thing clea=\r\nrly. Sannyasa or external renunciation is an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *attempt* to cut oneself =\r\noff from a few external objects that cause\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temptation (and bondage!) i=\r\nnternally. It is not a guarantee that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; internal temptations and bondage=\r\ns are completely destroyed. The real\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bondage comes from the internal a=\r\nttachment and not from the external\n&gt;&gt; &gt; objects. Work hard on removing it.=\r\n Do not despise the external objects\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or see them as &quot;leeches&quot; or becom=\r\ne fed up with them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 Film=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0Jyotish writ=\r\nings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 3, 20=\r\n11 at 2:00 PM, chaudhuri.krishnendu wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 Sannyasa has g=\r\not its own glory and advantages!
