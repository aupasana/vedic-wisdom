Tryambaka is \nthe \n&gt; name of Lord=\r\n Shiva as the father of the three worlds - bhu, bhuva \n&gt; and svarga lokas. =\r\nHe is the father and lord of the three \nmandala&#39;s - \n&gt; Surya, Soma and Agni=\r\n mandala. He is Maheswara, the lord of the \nthree \n&gt; Guna&#39;s - Satva, Rajas =\r\nand Tamas. He is the Sadashiva, the teacher \nof \n&gt; the three tatvas - Atma =\r\ntatva, Vidya tatva and Shiva tatva. He is \n&gt; the father (cause and source) =\r\nof the three energies (agni) - \n&gt; Aavahaniya, Garhapatya and Dakshinagni. H=\r\ne is the father of all \n&gt; physical creation through the three murti bhuta -=\r\n Prithvi (solid), \n&gt; Jala (liquid) and Tejas or agni (energy). He is the lo=\r\nrd of the \n&gt; three heavens created by the dominance of the three Gunas - Ra=\r\njas \n&gt; (Brahma), Satva (Vishnu) and Tamas (Shiva). Know Him to be the \n&gt; ni=\r\nrakara (formless) Sadashiva as He is above this physical mode \nand \n&gt; is th=\r\neir Maheswara. This is the first foot of the mantra (composed \n&gt; of eight s=\r\nyllables).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The second pada of the mantra,&quot; continued Sukracharya, &quot;i=\r\ns  \n&gt; Sugandhim Pushtivardhanam. Sugandhim refers to the fragrance of \nthe =\r\n\n&gt; flower that spreads in all directions, and in a similar way Shiva \nis \n&gt;=\r\n present in the entire creation, both animate and inanimate. In all \n&gt; the =\r\nbhutas (modes of existence), in the three Gunas (nature of \n&gt; creation as b=\r\neing Satva, Rajas or Tamas), in the ten indriyas \n(five \n&gt; gyana-indriyas o=\r\nr senses and five karma-indriyas or organs of \n&gt; action), in all the devas =\r\n(33 devas are the source of all \n&gt; illumination and enlightenment) and the =\r\nganas (hosts of demi-\ngods),  \n&gt; Shiva exists and pervades as the illumine =\r\natma (soul) and is their \n&gt; essence. Pustivardhanam is now being explained.=\r\n That inward \ndwelling \n&gt; spirit (atman), the Purusha Shiva is the real sus=\r\ntainer of \nPrakriti \n&gt; (and not vice-versa as all people perceive). Startin=\r\ng with the \n&gt; mahatatva (primordial state of matter/energy) to the individu=\r\nal \n&gt; parts of creation, the entire sustenance of the physically created \n&gt;=\r\n beings (both animate and inanimate) is done by the imperishable \n&gt; Purusha=\r\n. You, I, Brahma, Vishnu, the Munis and even Indra & devas \n&gt; are maintaine=\r\nd/sustained (by the atma and that is Him). Since the \n&gt; Purusha (atma - Shi=\r\nva) is the granter of sustenance to prakriti \n&gt; (body/nature), he is &#39;Pusti=\r\n-vardhana&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Having explained the first two pada of the mantra, Sukrac=\r\nharya \n&gt; continued to explain the remaining two pada. He said &quot; the next \nt=\r\nwo \n&gt; pada (consisting of sixteen syllables) is  Urvarukamiva Bandhanam \n&gt; =\r\nMrityormukshiya mamritat meaning - Prabhu! just as the ripe \ncucumber \n&gt; is=\r\n severed from the bondage of the creeper, in the same manner may \n&gt; we be d=\r\nelivered from death for the sake of immortality (moksha). \n&gt; Rudra deva is =\r\nlike amrita (nectar of immortality). Those who \nworship \n&gt; Him with good ka=\r\nrma, penance and repentance, meditation, \n&gt; contemplation, prayer or praise=\r\n, will surely renewed life and \nvigor. \n&gt; The strength of truth force (in t=\r\nhis mantra) is such that Lord \nShiva \n&gt; shall definitely free the worshippe=\r\nr from the bondage of death \n&gt; because Shiva alone is the giver of bondage =\r\nand moksha. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is the Mritasanjivani mantra and has the power to gi=\r\nve back \n&gt; life and rescue from death and great evils. You should adore Lor=\r\nd \n&gt; Shiva and recite this mantra. Water sanctified with this mantra \n&gt; sho=\r\nuld be drunk all the time. [Authors note: It is well known that \n&gt; the rudr=\r\naksha bead is placed in a glass of water after being held \nin \n&gt; the palm d=\r\nuring the recitation of the mantra. this water is drunk \n&gt; during the day.]=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Oblations in the sacrificial fire with this mantra is very \n&gt; purifyi=\r\nng. Now I shall teach the dhyana for the mantra.&quot; Saying \nso, \n&gt; Sukrachary=\r\na started reciting the shlokas for meditating on Lord \n&gt; Shiva.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Trust=\r\n this is also available for the general viewing and clarity \nfor \n&gt; the mem=\r\nbers of the Group\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you all for providing your valuable view on th=\r\ne matter and \n&gt; enligten me on the subject\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesh Gulati\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
