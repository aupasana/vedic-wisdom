The o=\r\nne with the lachrymose expression will advocate the worship of saints quoti=\r\nng the Bhagvat in his support\n=C2=A0\nTo those who have not trodden the path=\r\n of spirituality, such virulent flings may, indeed seem called for since th=\r\ne arguments, so far as they go, sound plausible enough. But to the authenti=\r\nc spiritual aspirant who has had some firsthand experience of the mystic pa=\r\nth and dived deeper for a clue to the seeming contradictions the plausibili=\r\nty of the indicter=E2=80=99s arguments will make little impression. For he =\r\nwill not only see that every doctrine or admonition must be judged in the c=\r\nontext in which it has been given, but that it did express=C2=A0 a truth wh=\r\nich however partial and incomplete in itself was a part of the total sympho=\r\nny a bead in the whole garland of wisdom. He will see that an injunction wh=\r\nich was beneficial in one century might well become the reverse in the late=\r\nr one and which is more that the sages prescribed variously for various see=\r\nkers because they came with various aspirations, receptivities, samskaras, =\r\nneeds and outlooks of life and Yoga.\n Thus for instance they did not ask th=\r\ne householder to give up all he had trusting to the Divine Grace to maintai=\r\nn him any more than they asked the aspirant who burned to stake everything =\r\nfor the Divine to cling to the world even when he was disgusted by the endl=\r\ness playing for safety of the worldly wise. Also, by means of the penetrati=\r\nng power of the light which they had evoked after a long and arduous=C2=A0 =\r\nstruggle with the human EGO they had achieved a deep insight into the human=\r\n psychology and so were able to give only such advice to as aspirant as wou=\r\nld proved really helpful to him. This advice was not the same for all becau=\r\nse all could not arrive in the same way. A youthful cenobite with an unimpa=\r\nired body was counseled to practice asana and pranayama because he would be=\r\n able to bear the reaction brought on by such strenuous exercise, a middle =\r\naged head of a family was referred to simple meditation because he would no=\r\nt be able to profit by a more\n austere technique, an old man was told to ta=\r\nke to the still simple process of just repeating a Name.\nWhat a limited Mod=\r\nern mind with its insistence on reason regulating all our movements fails s=\r\no often to grasp is that the spiritual evolution as against that which is m=\r\nerely moral or ethical seldom follows a straight line of ascent. Furthermor=\r\ne the path of the spirit is the path of such strange happenings that it may=\r\n necessitate new orientations at every step. More explicitly what helps an =\r\naspirant at one stage of his evolution may hinder him at a later stage and =\r\nconversely what hindered him at the bottom of the ascent may well help him =\r\nwhen he has raised a few steps.\n................\n=C2=A0\n\n\n      Your Mail w=\r\norks best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8.
