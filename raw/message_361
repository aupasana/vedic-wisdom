When I was meditating before replying to you, a=\r\n really beautiful and meaningful analogy came to me and I think it is worth=\r\n sharing with more people than just you. To ensure your anonymity, I remove=\r\nd references in the quoted mail below that may help one identify you.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nFirst I will answer your first question in detail, becau=\r\nse that can automatically answer other questions.\n \n&gt; 1. Are Vedic (Pure Va=\r\nithika rituals) different from Mantra Shastras\n&gt; (people explain that mantr=\r\na shastra does not originate from the vedas,\n&gt; but classified under tantra)=\r\n. Did Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhe=\r\nn people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can only laugh. Th=\r\ney are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect swara or masteri=\r\nng a celebrated commentary does not help one understand Veda. In fact, unde=\r\nrstanding each single verse in Veda requires great tapascharya. Understandi=\r\nng a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (int=\r\nuition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with =\r\nenergy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor =\r\nlogic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better expr=\r\nession, direct knowledge.\n \nWhen one meditates long enough on a verse, the =\r\nverse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the only way to understan=\r\nd a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible to decipher even a sin=\r\ngle verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.\n \nBottomoline is: Almost =\r\nnobody understands Veda today. What are considered &quot;pure vaidika rituals&quot; a=\r\nre merely another variety of rituals created by someone at some point of ti=\r\nme. From the point of view of authenticity as granted by Veda, there is no =\r\ndifference between them and other aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly=\r\n believe otherwise.\n \n*        *        *\n \nA simple analogy may help clari=\r\nfy a lot of things related to this complicated issue a little. What the thi=\r\nng in the analogy represents is shown here and there in square brackets [].=\r\n\n \nOnce there were many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aatman]. The=\r\ny regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [expe=\r\nrienced Brahman]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].=\r\n\n \nAs people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually ev=\r\nolved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the s=\r\nea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with tim=\r\ne. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n \nPeople started =\r\nmoving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert=\r\n far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like=\r\n a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking t=\r\nowards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had t=\r\no walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of=\r\n thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or =\r\nsome interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n \nThen=\r\n came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of=\r\n walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find =\r\nthe sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the=\r\n sea, which included riding a horse [new aagamas].\n \nPeople performing the =\r\nold rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not gra=\r\nnted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; s=\r\nea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand wh=\r\nat the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply be=\r\nlieved that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were us=\r\ned to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructions were mea=\r\nnt for someone already close to sea and the newer instructions came from so=\r\nmeone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how =\r\nto get to the sea from there!\n \nSlowly many new sets of instructions involv=\r\ning horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were out=\r\nlined instead of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of=\r\n mantra/tantra/yantras].\n \nOne particular path through jungles was dangerou=\r\ns [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, win=\r\ne etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it=\r\n was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. T=\r\nhere were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritua=\r\nl] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise=\r\n man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path a=\r\nnd discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who we=\r\nre strong enough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.\n \nA=\r\ns time progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was su=\r\nperior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructi=\r\nons, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or=\r\n other variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many follow=\r\ned the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did=\r\n not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joi=\r\nrneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the instructions fait=\r\nhfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory=\r\n and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back an=\r\nd gave updated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition=\r\n.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief=\r\n summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes variou=\r\ns aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered th=\r\ne highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible way=\r\ns to reach that state. While definitive statements can be made on the actua=\r\nl state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on=\r\n how to reach it. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n \nGreat men i=\r\nn many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, exp=\r\nerienced that state, understood the current state of people around them and=\r\n gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current sta=\r\nte. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead =\r\nkept arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n \nPlease re-read the s=\r\ntory and try to understand what each part of the story represents. If you u=\r\nnderstand this analogy well, this can really clarify the meaningless nature=\r\n of so many debates that people waste time with!\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; =\r\n2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned\n&gt; Tantrik p=\r\nractices. But I also hear and read that he is a great Sri Vidya\n&gt; Upasaka h=\r\nimself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what did\n&gt; Sri Adi Sankara =\r\ncondemn? \n \nHe did condemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantr=\r\na like the use of sex, alcohol, meat etc.\n \nHowever, please go back to my a=\r\nnalogy. A great man may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea if=\r\n it has a lot of wild animals and dacoits and many travellers through that =\r\npath recently lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusa=\r\nble. It only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that pat=\r\nh are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the pract=\r\nice.\n \nIf the same great man is reincarnated at a different time when sever=\r\nal adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, he may not =\r\ncondemn the path and instead write on travelling that jungle path carefully=\r\n!\n \nThe words of great masters need to be interpreted within the context of=\r\n their desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of the purpose of that=\r\n particular birth.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; 3. What is vamachara? if it is=\r\n the left hand method - sex, drinks etc,\n&gt; why must it be practiced at all?=\r\n\n \nSuppose one&#39;s house is close to the market and the market noise reaches =\r\none&#39;s house. Suppose that noise is disturbing one&#39;s meditation, i.e. one is=\r\n unable to focus on god amid all the noise. There are two approaches one ca=\r\nn take - (1) run away from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate=\r\n there. (2) rise to the challenge, meditate right there and develop the abi=\r\nlity to turn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and contro=\r\nl over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturban=\r\nce. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is t=\r\nhe *inability* of one&#39;s mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling=\r\n one&#39;s mind, one can focus attention on god irrespective of what is happeni=\r\nng outside.\n \nApproach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a dece=\r\nnt chance of failure with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely pru=\r\ndent and worthwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with app=\r\nroach (2), it is great. It hastens one&#39;s progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nVaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of testing one&#39;s se=\r\nlf-control by rising to the challenge.\n \nPlease realize that vaamaachaara/a=\r\nghora is not about the use of sex, wine etc for the kick of it. It is about=\r\n their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges and hone one&#39;s self=\r\n-control. Self-realization comes when self-control is perfect and one&#39;s min=\r\nd can always be focussed on god no matter what is going on around one. If o=\r\nne is either attracted or averse to any one thing, that is enough to block =\r\nself-realization.\n \nHowever, if one is weak, it is better to stay away from=\r\n vaamaachaara. One needs to do other practices and strengthen oneself. If a=\r\n really pure yogi with perfect self-control is able to focus on god with al=\r\nl his mind even when he is drunk and sitting naked with a beautiful naked w=\r\noman tightly embracing him, then he can try that to test his self-control a=\r\nnd hone it. But, if that is going to tempt one, get the mind away from god =\r\nand onto a physical enjoyment, then one better not try that path! Just as o=\r\nne who does not have a strong mind to meditate amid noise should meditate i=\r\nn solitude and hone one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have a strong mind=\r\n to keep the focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices suc=\r\nh as wine, meat and sex should stay away from those.\n \n*        *        *\n=\r\n \nIn my analogy before, the short jungle path to the sea having the danger =\r\nof wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If =\r\none not having the wherewithal to battle and kill the wild animals and daco=\r\nits tries that path, one may be killed. Similarly, one who wants self-reali=\r\nzation using this path will fall if one does not have perfect self-control.=\r\n If one takes this path because it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely t=\r\no fall. It is only for the fittest and bravest.\n \nIf there is ANY weakness =\r\nin one&#39;s self-control, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many=\r\n paths from the desert to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to se=\r\nlf-realization. One should follow the path that is appropriate for one base=\r\nd on previous samskaras, strengths and weaknesses.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\n&gt; Is it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? \n \n:-) Sri Ambal (t=\r\nhe Divine Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies everywhere=\r\n! All knowledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her own diff=\r\nerent manifestations.\n \nIf a yogi with perfect self-control drinks wine and=\r\n sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him and yet keep=\r\ns his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focus on god are al=\r\nl different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.\n \nAs a matter of fact=\r\n, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursues carnal pleasures, his =\r\ndesires and actions are also different manifestations of Divine Mother only=\r\n. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level forms with specific domains =\r\nof responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as wel=\r\nl. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polari=\r\nties are actually Her manifestations only.\n \nHowever, those who are more co=\r\nmfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya=\r\n will look at only the former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and re=\r\nmain in duality. That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* rea=\r\nlity is that She is All.\n \nI need to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that=\r\n put a few things in perspective. You can send further questions to the yah=\r\noogroups or to me privately.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFr=\r\nee Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------ \n\n  Sri Sri NarasimhaJI\n  Namask=\r\narams.

I read from somewhere t=\r\nhat Sri Sri Adi Sankara \n  has condemned Tantrik practices. But I also hear=\r\n and read that he is a great \n  Sri Vidya Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has=\r\n its roots from Tantra, what did \n  Sri Adi Sankara condemn? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial size=3D2&gt;3.
