effort has to \ncontinue...what a mahabharatha this inner fight is! De=\r\nfinitely need God \nas the charioteer for any chance of success.&gt;&gt;\n\nAbsolute=\r\nly! One huge Mahabharata of confusions, errors, failings, again getting up =\r\nand trying, not stopping, changing the gunas of ones sadhana etc etc. Grace=\r\n is vital.\n\nBUT, and here is a big cause, many times people mistake the wor=\r\nkings of their own lower nature (Apara Prakriti) as some sort of grace. Thi=\r\ns is nothing but an attempt by different parts - of below the surface of th=\r\ne working mind -=C2=A0 to pull back the sadhana and hang on to the old pers=\r\nonality.\n\nThe whole of sadhana, in a nutshell, is changing our, stupid, fla=\r\nwed, ignorant surface personality. And once you do so, you WILL be forced t=\r\no renegotiate your old life-equations. But there is a lower prakirit in man=\r\n and nature as well, which works through the automated motions of our prana=\r\n shakti, that needs to be controlled. It has no light of God within it. Lig=\r\nht is knowledge. At the higher spiritual levels light and will are fused to=\r\ngether. In our plane of existence light, that is correct knowledge, and wil=\r\nl have become separated and distorted. Therefore often you may have the wil=\r\nl to achieve to something but not the right knowledge needed for it. This l=\r\neads to confusions.\n\nAnyway grace is product of true surrenderance from the=\r\n mind, from the deeper emotional being and the physical being. These also c=\r\norrespond to the consciousness working in manomaya-kosha, pranamaya-kosha a=\r\nnd annamaya-kosha. Until this is reached, grace does not come, and even if =\r\nit does, it gets perverted by our lower nature. In Gita Bhagawan calls it A=\r\npara-Prakriti. \n\nIt is one thing to say verbally that all sadhana being don=\r\ne is work of God&#39;s Shakti. It is entirely different matter to see it clearl=\r\ny for which one must a) surrender constantly b) reject and withdraw ones lo=\r\nwer nature, or at least keep it clam and checked c) make a sincere call to =\r\nGod. Only when these three work together, grace descends. And only grace ha=\r\ns the power to cause a thorough transformation of a sadhaka. Nothing less. =\r\nBut you can&#39;t demand grace, you can&#39;t beg for grace, you can&#39;t plead, you c=\r\nan&#39;t command, and you can&#39;t indulge in self-pity. We have to calmly and pat=\r\niently wait for it for when the time is right, it calls like a sweet rain o=\r\nn a parched throat, and in a flash it can do more than what we can imagine.=\r\n Basically, we cannot negotiate with God. Nothing less than a complete hone=\r\nst recoking on what we are, where we are heading, what mistakes lie in our =\r\nnature is a must.\n\nThen slowly you will be made to realize the working of a=\r\n higher Power that has nothing to do with your little surface personalities=\r\n push and pulls based on Pavlovian responses to situations incurred over li=\r\nfetimes. It is this Power, once understood, that needs to be unquestioningl=\r\ny submitted to in a progressive manner, while rejecting everything else ins=\r\nide us that pull us in a different direction and wants to hang on to our ea=\r\nrlier flawed personality. Long, long, long road. Patience is a key.\n\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nA few general thoughts on Purusacharana since th=\r\nere were a few mails on this topic. Again, just my opinion. Feel free to re=\r\nject it if needed.\n\nStart with the word. Purusha+acharana. Behaving like a =\r\nman. And what does it mean? Some may say it means being brave, being mental=\r\nly robust, being aggressive, or being commanding etc. All these are terms t=\r\nhat are often used in colloquial language to indicate a proverbial &#39;manly&#39; =\r\nbehavior. But in sadhana, Purusha is a different concept. Looking inwards a=\r\nnd separating a part of your being, from the mind, from your thoughts, from=\r\n your emotions, and even from your physcial nature. This part of your being=\r\n will only stand back and watch, as silent witness, and then either give or=\r\n reject consent to various movements of your lower nature (lust, anger, jea=\r\nlousy, greed, covetousness, ETC). Once this is firmly installed in your sys=\r\ntem - this Purusha - it will be able to stop and clam down various parts of=\r\n your being which have the tendency to leap-up in joy (sukha) or get deflat=\r\ned (dukhkha) at surface appearances and shallow understandings. This is how=\r\n a Purusha\n works in Yoga. When this kind of Purusha consciounsess is insta=\r\nlled and established, an expansion of the mind happens beyond the rational,=\r\n the emotional or even the physical nature/consciousness.\n\nAfter this basic=\r\n step has been done properly, then the sadhana of purushacharana is to be d=\r\none. By this method, a progressive 1/10 numerical deduction in the sadhana =\r\nis done for each element. That is for 1000 japas, 100 homas, 10 tarpana, 1 =\r\nmarjana and finally feeding people. Each of this will affect a realization =\r\nof the mantra is each of the layers - in reverse order from annamaya-kosha,=\r\n to pranamaya-kosha, to manomaya-kosha to vigyanmaya-kosha (the spiritual l=\r\nayers beyond and above the reasoning mind). THAT is the perfect effect of a=\r\n spotless purushacharana. That is mantra siddhi and mantra chaitanya.\n\nWhil=\r\ne doing a purushacharana, tremenodus amount of obstacles will come in the p=\r\nath of the sadhaka. To overcome these, while sticking to the exacting rules=\r\n of the sadhana, one MUST have done the first step properly, that is instal=\r\nled a Purusha consciousness in his/her system, one that is unshakeable in a=\r\nny adverse conditions. One that is perfectly unmoved by the working of the =\r\nlower nature in man as well as outside man. For example, one may get affect=\r\ned by high fever, various crisis situations, various attacks from hostile f=\r\norces etc etc, Many things. But inspite of that the Purusha consciouness, i=\r\nf it has been firmly established, will drive the sadhana without a glitch, =\r\nremaining unmoved. Of course, one must honestly judge how far such a consci=\r\nousness has been developed. Self-delusion has to be guarded against.\n\nOne c=\r\nan try for oneself to do purushacharanas and see how far one succeeds. In m=\r\ny opinion though, 98 % of seekers in this age are unfit to do purushacharan=\r\na and succeed in this sadhana. For the Purusha consciousness has not been e=\r\nstablished in the system by most people. In the last 6 years among all vari=\r\neties of sadhakas I have met, of various paths, only two were there who I f=\r\nelt can pull off a genuine purusacharana. Rest no chance.\n\nDoing any sadhan=\r\na at the same time, same place, using same materials, without breaks for ye=\r\nars and years is always good. Goes without saying. This too, most people ca=\r\nnnot do flawlessly. Purushacharana is far more complex and demanding. \n\nThe=\r\nn the other option is to develop genuine surrender from the deepest part of=\r\n your heart. Do sadhana, and wait patiently. Her grace is bound to come and=\r\n illuminate the path. Meanhile, we can keep working on rectifying the lower=\r\n nature in ourselves.\n\nJai Ma Tara.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\naw=\r\naktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyay=\r\namanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: sunrise_1080=\r\n &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Tuesday=\r\n, 23 October 2012 3:07 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re:\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste Ra=\r\njarshiji,\n\nThat is a very interesting way of looking at a yantra.

Respectfully yet firmly I disagree on one point.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;Myself:=\r\n Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in \n&gt; Aghore =\r\nbook - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that \n&gt; book ser=\r\nies)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or reg=\r\nular \n&gt; chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10.=\r\n You \n&gt; have to follow it strictly.&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is always good to do japa,=\r\n but &quot;strict&quot; is too strong a word. There are many in different parts of In=\r\ndia, well versed in sadhana as well as respective shastras (respective beca=\r\nuse no single human being can known all possible Hindu Shastras, so most st=\r\nudy that which maybe relevant to his line of spiritual inquiry followed in =\r\nhis tradition) who do homas without doing any pre-requisite japa. \n&gt; \n&gt; One=\r\n honest question that every sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectively is=\r\n, how badly do we want God? If the desire pure and unblemished, or is it al=\r\nso mixed with various other desires, however small they maybe. If we also w=\r\nant other materialistic things along with it - and there is no harm in want=\r\ning legitimate things - then one can follow all instructions and rules set =\r\nfor whatever parampara one is mentally afflicted to and given by his/her Gu=\r\nru(s). \n&gt; \n&gt; But if one is desirous of ONLY God without any other desire at=\r\ntached to it, no rule is sufficient, no path is a guarantee, no sadhana is =\r\nsure-shot way to achieve it.=C3=82=C2=A0 Working on internal surrender to G=\r\nod and increased detachment in daily life along with and through whatever r=\r\nitual one performs and in whatever manner, can be more helpful in the long =\r\nrun. Human aspiration alone is not enough. When the aspiration is genuine a=\r\nnd pure, He/She extends his/her energy to lift the sadhak up.. this dual ph=\r\nenomenon together make a sadhana success. And this simple yet powerful trut=\r\nh is represented by the six-pointed triangle which is the basic yantra of s=\r\no many deities, and specially one form of the Mother. The upward triangle i=\r\ns our aspiration, the downward is Her grace coming down to transform the sa=\r\ndhak from his/her current state. Together, it makes a complete whole. And g=\r\nrace is purely proportional to the purity of the aspiration, which only God=\r\n can judge\n&gt;  accurately.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awa=\r\nktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwya=\r\nyamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: ash=\r\nutosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n=\r\n&gt; Sent: Monday, 22 October 2012 5:17 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam - A=\r\nhuti numbers\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; I have been perfo=\r\nrming weekly havan for more than a year and half.\n&gt; I want to point out cer=\r\ntain things related to havan so that it can be done as per shastra by other=\r\ns too.\n&gt; I am using a conversation that in fact took place to bring out the=\r\nse relevant points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session=\r\n whose summary I am presenting below: \n&gt; \n&gt; [South Indians might be familia=\r\nr with similar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something g=\r\noes wrong - called as dosha.]\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a d=\r\nosha...

And what is =\r\nthe dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do re=\r\nquired Japa before giving ahutis?

No I dont do any pre-defined set of j=\r\napa?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsh=\r\na. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one become=\r\ns qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for ev=\r\nery 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahut=\r\ni)\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I rea=\r\nd in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that=\r\n book series)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. Puraschara=\r\nNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least=\r\n 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The conversation went onto seve=\r\nral other things.

We have to calmly and patiently wait for it for w=\r\nhen the time is right, it calls like a sweet rain on a parched throat, and =\r\nin a flash it can do more than what we can imagine. Basically, we cannot ne=\r\ngotiate with God. Nothing less than a complete honest recoking on what we a=\r\nre, where we are heading, what mistakes lie in our nature is a must.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Then slowly you will be made to realize the working of a higher Power that=\r\n has nothing to do with your little surface personalities push and pulls ba=\r\nsed on Pavlovian responses to situations incurred over lifetimes. It is thi=\r\ns Power, once understood, that needs to be unquestioningly submitted to in =\r\na progressive manner, while rejecting everything else inside us that pull u=\r\ns in a\n different direction and wants to hang on to our earlier flawed pers=\r\nonality. Long, long, long road. Patience is a key.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few general thoughts on Purusacharana since there wer=\r\ne a few mails on this topic. Again, just my opinion. Feel free to reject it=\r\n if needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Start with the word. Purusha+acharana. Behaving like a m=\r\nan. And what does it mean? Some may say it means being brave, being mentall=\r\ny robust, being aggressive, or being commanding etc. All these are terms th=\r\nat are often used in colloquial language to indicate a proverbial &#39;manly&#39; b=\r\nehavior. But in sadhana, Purusha is a different concept. Looking inwards an=\r\nd separating a part of your being, from the mind, from your thoughts, from =\r\nyour emotions, and even from your physcial nature. This part of your being =\r\nwill only stand back and watch, as silent witness, and then either give or =\r\nreject consent to various movements of your lower nature (lust, anger,\n jea=\r\nlousy, greed, covetousness, ETC). Once this is firmly installed in your sys=\r\ntem - this Purusha - it will be able to stop and clam down various parts of=\r\n your being which have the tendency to leap-up in joy (sukha) or get deflat=\r\ned (dukhkha) at surface appearances and shallow understandings. This is how=\r\n a Purusha works in Yoga. When this kind of Purusha consciounsess is instal=\r\nled and established, an expansion of the mind happens beyond the rational, =\r\nthe emotional or even the physical nature/consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After this =\r\nbasic step has been done properly, then the sadhana of purushacharana is to=\r\n be done. By this method, a progressive 1/10 numerical deduction in the sad=\r\nhana is done for each element. That is for 1000 japas, 100 homas, 10 tarpan=\r\na, 1 marjana and finally feeding people. Each of this will affect a realiza=\r\ntion of the mantra is each of the layers - in reverse order from annamaya-k=\r\nosha, to pranamaya-kosha, to manomaya-kosha to vigyanmaya-kosha\n (the spiri=\r\ntual layers beyond and above the reasoning mind). THAT is the perfect effec=\r\nt of a spotless purushacharana. That is mantra siddhi and mantra chaitanya.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While doing a purushacharana, tremenodus amount of obstacles will c=\r\nome in the path of the sadhaka. To overcome these, while sticking to the ex=\r\nacting rules of the sadhana, one MUST have done the first step properly, th=\r\nat is installed a Purusha consciousness in his/her system, one that is unsh=\r\nakeable in any adverse conditions. One that is perfectly unmoved by the wor=\r\nking of the lower nature in man as well as outside man. For example, one ma=\r\ny get affected by high fever, various crisis situations, various attacks fr=\r\nom hostile forces etc etc, Many things. But inspite of that the Purusha con=\r\nsciouness, if it has been firmly established, will drive the sadhana withou=\r\nt a glitch, remaining unmoved. Of course, one must honestly judge how far s=\r\nuch a consciousness has been developed. Self-delusion has\n to be guarded ag=\r\nainst.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One can try for oneself to do purushacharanas and see how far=\r\n one succeeds. In my opinion though, 98 % of seekers in this age are unfit =\r\nto do purushacharana and succeed in this sadhana. For the Purusha conscious=\r\nness has not been established in the system by most people. In the last 6 y=\r\nears among all varieties of sadhakas I have met, of various paths, only two=\r\n were there who I felt can pull off a genuine purusacharana. Rest no chance=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing any sadhana at the same time, same place, using same materia=\r\nls, without breaks for years and years is always good. Goes without saying.=\r\n This too, most people cannot do flawlessly. Purushacharana is far more com=\r\nplex and demanding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the other option is to develop genuine sur=\r\nrender from the deepest part of your heart. Do sadhana, and wait patiently.=\r\n Her grace is bound to come and illuminate the path. Meanhile, we can keep =\r\nworking on rectifying the lower nature in\n ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jai Ma Tara.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple=\r\n-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roma=\r\nn, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243=\r\n527249952 yui_3_7_2_45_1350985979680_69&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy=\r\n;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:=\r\n Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times,\n serif; font-siz=\r\ne: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1=\r\n&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;=\r\nsunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:=\r\n bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, 23 October 2012 3:07 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt;=\r\n &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1829539165&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;di=\r\nsplay:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1829539165ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n     =\r\n \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Namaste Rajarshiji,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThat is a very interesting=\r\n way of looking at a yantra.

Respectfu=\r\nlly yet firmly I disagree on one point.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Myself: =\r\nDoesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\nghore book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; book series)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to an=\r\nything. PurascharaNa or regular &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule=\r\n is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have to follow it strictly=\r\n.&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is always good to do japa, but &quot;stri=\r\nct&quot; is too strong a word. There are many in different parts of India, well =\r\nversed in sadhana as well as respective shastras (respective because no sin=\r\ngle human being can known all possible Hindu Shastras, so most study that w=\r\nhich maybe relevant to his line of spiritual inquiry followed in his tradit=\r\nion) who do homas without doing any pre-requisite japa. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n One honest question that every sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectivel=\r\ny is, how badly do we want God? If the desire pure and unblemished, or is i=\r\nt also mixed with various other desires, however small they maybe. If we al=\r\nso want other materialistic things along with it - and there is no harm in =\r\nwanting legitimate things - then one can follow all instructions and rules =\r\nset for whatever parampara one is mentally afflicted to and given by his/he=\r\nr Guru(s). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But if one is desirous of ONLY God without a=\r\nny other desire attached to it, no rule is sufficient, no path is a guarant=\r\nee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achieve it.=C3=82&nbsp; Working on inter=\r\nnal surrender to God and increased detachment in daily life along with and =\r\nthrough whatever ritual one performs and in whatever manner, can be more he=\r\nlpful in the long run. Human aspiration alone is not enough. When the aspir=\r\nation is genuine and pure, He/She extends his/her energy to lift the sadhak=\r\n up.. this dual phenomenon together make a sadhana success. And this simple=\r\n yet powerful truth is represented by the six-pointed triangle which is the=\r\n basic yantra of so many deities, and specially one form of the Mother. The=\r\n upward triangle is our aspiration, the downward is Her grace coming down t=\r\no transform the sadhak from his/her current state. Together, it makes a com=\r\nplete whole. And grace is purely proportional to the purity of the aspirati=\r\non, which only God can\n judge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  accurately.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Reg=\r\nards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; awaktam wy=\r\naktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwya=\r\nyamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ________________________=\r\n________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  From: ashutosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@...&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, 22 October 2012 5:17 P=\r\nM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam - Ahuti numbers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; My pranams to all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have been =\r\nperforming weekly havan for more than a year and half.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I want to p=\r\noint out certain things related to havan so that it can be done as per shas=\r\ntra by others too.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am using a conversation that in fact took pla=\r\nce to bring out these relevant points.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sometime back the=\r\nre was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am presenting below: &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala=\r\n prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.=\r\n]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm...=\r\n let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni kar=\r\nya at your home regularly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually v=\r\nery surprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about=\r\n the havan I did at home)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There are c=\r\nertain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry sam=\r\nith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa cond=\r\nuctor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving =\r\nit as ahuti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahu=\r\nti apart from that?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do require=\r\nd Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra t=\r\nhat you use for your regular japa?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Myself: What?... Requ=\r\nired Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined=\r\n set of japa?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-=\r\nahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via=\r\n meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be =\r\ndashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is q=\r\nualified to give 1 ahuti)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply=\r\n to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in thi=\r\ns group is already familiar with that book series)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Prash=\r\nNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. =\r\nDoesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follo=\r\nw it strictly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The conversation went onto several other =\r\nthings. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished s=\r\neer and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in=\r\n homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with =\r\nmy spiritual progress since. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Whether all the homa-pract=\r\nioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out =\r\nto all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra=\r\n used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ashutosh&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--2124734478-625438714-1350990033=:56031--\r\n\n"}}
