His\nbi=\r\nrth centenary was celebrated recently.\n\nIT WAS in the year 1922 that a few =\r\nof us religiously inclined college\nstudents undertook a pilgrimage from Mad=\r\nras to Tiruvannamalai for a darshan\nof Ramana Maharshi. The Asramam was the=\r\nn in its initial stage. An august\nperson was seated on a raised platform, a=\r\nnd it was evident he was the sage\nwhom we had come to see.\n\nAround him on t=\r\nhe floor were seated a number of devotees, all intently\nlooking at him, and=\r\n we found our places among them. Silence reigned supreme.\nThe presiding dei=\r\nty of the Asramam was the author of that silence, hence its\nperfection. Thi=\r\ns was a novel experience for us, but we took to this\ncongenial environment =\r\nquite happily.\n\nThere was no such thing as a formal introduction of newly a=\r\nrrived devotees.\nAs others did, we sat quietly. Maharshi turned his penetra=\r\nting gaze at us\noff and on. We felt ourselves highly blessed by his benign =\r\nlook.\nOccasionally he spoke a word or two, which was always pertinent and t=\r\no the\npoint. But his silence was more eloquent. An occasional smile reveale=\r\nd his\nbliss.\n\nVisiting devotees often brought packets of sugar-candy or som=\r\ne such thing\nand offered them to him. He would help himself to a tiny piece=\r\n from the\npacket and pass it on to the assembled group. Then and there it w=\r\nould be\nshared by the entire lot.\n\nI made deeper personal contact with the =\r\nMaharshi in the year 1928. I had\nrenounced the world in 1923 and joined the=\r\n Ramakrishna Math. In 1926 I\nentered the order of sannyasa.\n\nFrom 1926 to 1=\r\n940 I was in charge of the Ramakrishna Asramam at Ootacamund.\nDuring that p=\r\neriod, when I travelled between Ootacamund and Madras, I took\nas many oppor=\r\ntunities as possible to go to Tiruvannamalai in order to see\nthe Maharshi. =\r\nI was not inclined to talk much with him; being seated in his\npresence was =\r\nmore than sufficient. Occasionally he spoke, but his silence\nwas what I sou=\r\nght and prized every time I went to him. A purified enquirer\nmade a rich ha=\r\nrvest of the blissful calmness that prevailed in his presence.\n\nThe Maharsh=\r\ni occupied a couch in a corner of a middle-sized hall in the\nAsramam. Barri=\r\nng this corner the entire hall was at the disposal of the\nvisiting public, =\r\nand anybody could go into the hall at any time of the day\nor night. Visitin=\r\ng devotees would quietly steal in, sit for a while in quiet\nmeditation and =\r\nthen leave unobtrusively. One day a man following the path of\ndevotion came=\r\n in and occupied a place very near the sage. Then he unburdened\nall that la=\r\ny buried in his heart.\n\nHis speech was choked with feeling. He poured forth=\r\n, &quot;I have gone on\npilgrimage all over the land. I have been regular in my s=\r\npiritual practices.\nMany a sleepless night have I passed in prayer. Still t=\r\no this day I have had\nno mercy from the Lord. I am forlorn.&quot; He cried bitte=\r\nrly, but Maharshi sat\nunconcerned. Eventually all his suppressed feelings w=\r\nere worked out, and\nthen in a measured voice the sage said, &quot;Strange man. H=\r\ne cries =E2=80=93 what is\nthere to sob about? Instead of being poised in th=\r\ne blissful Self, he goes on\nwailing.&quot; This observation had a telling effect=\r\n. The man saw that his\nproblem was self-created, and a new chapter in his l=\r\nife started.\n\nOn another occasion a talkative man made his appearance in th=\r\ne hall. He\nchose to sit near the sage and unceremoniously raised a question=\r\n, &quot;Bhagavan,\nwhat is your view on birth control?&quot; There was no answer, so t=\r\nhe man\nexplained at length the importance of the topic. Again getting no re=\r\nply, he\ncontinued until he could say no more, and then fell silent. Silence=\r\n reigned\nsupreme in the hall. In the midst of this silence, Maharshi asked,=\r\n &quot;Do you\nknow death control?&quot; There was no response.\n\nOne day it was sugges=\r\nted to Maharshi that no spiritual progress could ever\nbe made without sadha=\r\nna, or spiritual discipline. After a pause he made\nthese observations:\n\n&quot;Mi=\r\nnd it is that binds man, and the same mind it is that liberates him. Mind\ni=\r\ns constituted of sankalpa and vikalpa, desire and disposition. Desire\nshape=\r\ns and governs disposition. Desire is of two kinds =E2=80=93 the noble and t=\r\nhe\nbase. The base desires are lust and greed. Noble desire is directed towa=\r\nrds\nenlightenment and emancipation. Base desire contaminates and clouds the=\r\n\nunderstanding. Sadhana is easy for the aspirant who is endowed with noble\n=\r\ndesires. Calmness is the criterion of spiritual progress. Plunge the\npurifi=\r\ned mind into the Heart. Then the work is over. This is the essence of\nall s=\r\npiritual discipline!&quot;\n\nDuring one of my visits I was seated at some distanc=\r\ne from Maharshi. There\nwere many devotees in the hall and the usual silence=\r\n prevailed. I remembered\nhis injunction to &quot;Plunge the pure mind into the H=\r\neart,&quot; and decided to\npractise it then. I gazed at him and he gazed back at=\r\n me. What followed was\nindescribable. His body seemed a glass case from whi=\r\nch a blissful brilliance\nstreamed out. More than half an hour passed this w=\r\nay. It was an experience\nunique and unforgettable.\n\nIt confirmed Ramakrishn=\r\na&#39;s statement that spiritual experience can be\ntransmitted from one person =\r\nto another in the manner in which material\nthings are handed over.\n\nBharata=\r\n Varsha is ever the bestower of spirituality on mankind.Ramana\nMaharshi is =\r\nverily a true spiritual son of this holy land, who spontaneously\nand impers=\r\nonally showered benediction on mankind.\n\n=E2=80=94 The Mountain Path, Jayan=\r\nthi, 1998\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2010/?pg=3Djul-aug=\r\n#article.5\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =\r\n =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd4c0f01c144e048b2bdcf7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Swami Chidbhavananda joined the=\r\n Ramakrishna Order at a very young age.
