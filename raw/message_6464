It is a powerful tool and if yo=\r\nu notice the stotra you will find worship being done at the Nine enclosures=\r\n of the sri chakra and the forms of the goddess at each enclosure and trian=\r\ngle.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a misconception to think traditional worship done in temple=\r\ns is the sattvic form and tantric worship is worship of the tamasic form. B=\r\noth are one and the same ,just materials having been substituted.\n&gt; \n&gt; If y=\r\nou wish to read this is an nice document on the Khadgamala stotra from Devi=\r\npuram . They do a really good job of dispelling some of the myths around de=\r\nvi worship and also have thrown open the doors of devi worship to one and a=\r\nll.\n&gt; \n&gt; One is an audio link with Amritananda Natha Saraswati himself chan=\r\nting it.His voice is mesmerizing and soothing.The other is the stotra with =\r\nmeanings of each round of the stotra.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://old.devipuram.com/downloa=\r\nds/khadgamala_stotram.html\n&gt; \n&gt; www.shaktisadhana.org/images/Khadgamala/KSF=\r\nINAL.doc\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimh=\r\na,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many thanks for making it all clear, its very fine, but ex=\r\ntremely important. summarizing for myself\n&gt; &gt; 1.

Then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is o=\r\nk to dig in several places to become familiar with digging.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nough one may specialize in one subject in higher studies, one learns \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n many subjects at a young age. But, eventually you have to focus on one \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; subject. Similarly, worshipping several deities with several mantras is=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ok in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My thumb rule is this: Leave all =\r\nmantras and stick to one, if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable with it. If you fe=\r\nel guilty and uncomfortable, then you are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably not ready yet and=\r\n so keep doing your entire routine. But start \n&gt; &gt; &gt; focusing on one mantra=\r\n and do more of it, i.e. do others for a small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; duration and spend mo=\r\nst doing one mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do not have perfect enough knowledge o=\r\nf astrology to rely on it.

But lagna lord Mercury is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; super-strong and shows Vishnu. =\r\nSaturn shows ascetic and Sun shows Rama. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, Sun-Saturn-Mercury comb=\r\nination to me shows Rama in an ascetic form \n&gt; &gt; &gt; during vanavas. Worship =\r\nRama. Develop the HanumadBhava (think and act \n&gt; &gt; &gt; like Hanuman) and wors=\r\nhip Rama. It can make both Mars and Mercury in own \n&gt; &gt; &gt; houses work stron=\r\ngly in your chart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;              =\r\n      http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Thu, Jun 2, 2011 at 4:10 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;     Namaste narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does make sense to read 10 strotras f=\r\nor 5-6 dieties daily.
