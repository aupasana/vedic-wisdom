Not only that, but you can do homam to \na very very badly placed and afflicted planet in your chart also. There is \nno problem with it. In fact, Maharshi Parasara suggests doing homam with the \nmantra of the planet that is badly afflicted in a chart, for relief. See the \nchapter on &quot;graha shanti&quot; in &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot;.\n\nAnybody can do homa to any planet or any deity, irrespective of the \nhoroscope.\n\nJupiter is badhakesha in my chart and he is in an inimical house. I have \nbeen doing a homam daily for 2.5 years.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;aparajita_vidya&quot; &lt;aparajita_vidya@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 12:24 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] One question on Jupiter\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; I know this is not a forum to discuss astrology but if you would be so\n&gt; kind as to answer just one question regarding astrology and homa.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading somewhere that the fire of a homa is represented by\n&gt; Jupiter among planets. So in case someone has a very badly placed\n&gt; jupiter which badhakesh or much afflicted, is it adviseable for such a\n&gt; person to perform homa? Or will it lead to great dangers?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Aparajita\n\n\n"}}
