Is it his karma\nor our karma that we should have this grief?&quot;\n\nBhaga=\r\nvan: The prarabdha which the child had to work out in this life was\nover an=\r\nd so it passed away. So we may call it the child&#39;s karma. So far as\nyou are=\r\n concerned, it is open to you not to grieve over it, but to remain\ncalm and=\r\n unaffected by it, being convinced that the child was not yours but\nalways =\r\nonly God&#39;s, that God gave and God took away. And in this connection\nBhagava=\r\nn took out the Yoga Vasishta in English to refer to the story of\nPunya and =\r\nPavana. Strange to say, when he casually opened the book, it\nactually opene=\r\nd at the story he had in mind. And from the book he asked me\nto read out th=\r\ne portion where Punya advises his brother Pavana not to grieve\nfoolishly ov=\r\ner the death of their parents, pointing out that Pavana had had\ninnumerable=\r\n births in the past, in each one of which he had a number of\nrelations and =\r\nthat exactly as he is not mourning for the death of all those\nrelations now=\r\n, he should not now mourn for the death of their father either.\n\nThe visito=\r\nr asked, &quot;When a person dies while yet a child and another lives\nlong, whic=\r\nh of them is the greater sinner?&quot;\n\nB: I cannot say.\n\nI told the visitor tha=\r\nt the data he had given could not by themselves enable\nanyone to judge whic=\r\nh was the greater sinner.\n\nVisitor: If a person lives long, he has greater =\r\nchances of perfecting steps\nto reach realisation.\n\nB: The person dying youn=\r\ng may soon be reborn and have in that life better\nchances of striving towar=\r\nds realisation than the other person living long in\nthis life.\n\nA visitor a=\r\nsked, &quot;When it is said that we must renounce all activities, is\nit meant th=\r\nat we should reduce our activities as much as possible?&quot;\n\nB: By giving up a=\r\nctivities is meant giving up attachment to activities or\nthe fruits thereof=\r\n, giving up the notion `I am the doer&#39;. The activities for\ngoing through wh=\r\nich this body has come, will have to be gone through.
