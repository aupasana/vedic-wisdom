Sudha wrote that in olden days Rishis eat only fallen f=\r\nruits\nIs it then acceptible if one consumes meat of anials that die natural=\r\nly?\n\n2. At the end of Mahabarata, Krishna takes Dharamaraj to Bhishma and B=\r\nhisma tells him what is dharma and what is adharma. In there, he clearly in=\r\nstructs killing animals and eating meating as adharma. I read these verses =\r\nlong time back.\n\n3. Tulasidas as women basher:\nNormally when you take one v=\r\nerse it could convey different meaning. Was there any context set prior to =\r\none doha where he said Nari Pasu?\n\nAlso, it could have been corrupted by so=\r\nme one later on!\n\nEven greats saints may have weaknesses and may have done =\r\nwrong things. I do not personally see any benefit of debating and trying to=\r\n proove that a specifc personality had a bad quality as it would not help m=\r\ny spiritual progress.\n\n4. Even plants have life: True. So, is vegatarian fo=\r\nod about not taking a life or is it not creating pain or is it not eating m=\r\neat?\n\nAs I am typing, an incident in Ramakrishna&#39;s life came to my mind. On=\r\ne day, Tagore was looking at a lawn and was amased by its beauty, and he id=\r\nentified himself with grass, and at that time a bird landed on the grass an=\r\nd pecked on the grass. Ramakrishna&#39;s body recieved those peckings and start=\r\ned bleeding.\n\nI was told by my guru that even non-living things have a suks=\r\nhma sarira and qualities. That is why we purify even the non-living things =\r\nwe use for puja.\n\nNow coming back to my original thinking:\nPlants have two =\r\nmajor differences from Animals.\n a. Plants make their own food from Sun lig=\r\nht, Air and water. Animals can not do it\n b. Plants can grow even if we cut=\r\n their leafs and branches. Even though some anamials can regenerate (like l=\r\nizards can grow their tail), the capacity is much slower and we can visuall=\r\ny see the pain of an animal when we injure it or kill it\n\nGood or bad is in=\r\n the eyes and mind of the doer! Dharmavatha was a butcher by profession and=\r\n he killed animals but was a learned man.\nIf one can feel completely unemot=\r\nional and unattached while killing he perhaps will not be touched by the si=\r\nn resulted in killing an animal. How ever, for most of us it is easy to avo=\r\nid the feeling of guilt by eating vegetarian food. Please note unattachment=\r\n is different from avoiding thinking.\n\nThe animals like lion kill other sma=\r\nll animals but, they can not survive on grass, their body is not meant for =\r\nit. How ever, our body can live healthy on vegetarian food.\n\nMost of the de=\r\nadly virus have spread by consuming meat.\n\n5. Tamas: Narasimha has mentione=\r\nd eating meat will result in increased Tamas. Is Satwa, Tajas and Tamas men=\r\ntal qualities or physical qualities?\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n\n"}}
