Nara=\r\nsimha,\nI was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was still =\r\nat my mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in Sa=\r\nhaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things sho=\r\nuld be. \n\nFor example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest order, r=\r\nan away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura instead of fig=\r\nhting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself years later would advice=\r\n Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a satisfying intellec=\r\ntual answer to it if people raise questions?\n\nSri Aurobindo gave a beautifu=\r\nl explanation about it. It was something like: If Krishna were constrained =\r\nto win all times, that would be a limitation in itself! An Avatar chooses e=\r\nven defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more complete victory in the=\r\n scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the original to get his exac=\r\nt words.. I read it long ago.\n\nAnother instance that comes to mind - Some t=\r\nhieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ash=\r\nram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual=\r\n head of the Ashram and one can intellectually argue that it was his dharma=\r\n to protect the ashram and inmates from the thieves. \n\nBesides, there were =\r\ncertain things that I did not want to put in an public email. \n\nSome clues =\r\n- AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhs=\r\nn Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There were several threats f=\r\nrom certain militants from one community about planting bombs or disrupting=\r\n it in other ways police security provided was not sufficient for that size=\r\nd gathering.\n\nThe concerned debate where lot of SIMI members were among the=\r\n participants happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 2006.\n\nSome people beli=\r\neve Sri Sri&#39;s presence in the event changed the heart of some miscreants.\n\n=\r\nMany does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings with the future head=\r\n of state of a superpower few minutes before the meeting was to happen. Som=\r\netimes he attends some events which cannot be explained logically by his di=\r\nsciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty about an enlightened=\r\n Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain them in our mind=\r\n. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much higher.\n\nAs the M=\r\nother would say if something is beyond our mental understanding, we can mai=\r\nntain a respectable silence about it. \n\nI do not expect my answers to satis=\r\nfy all the questions. I feel I have said everything I had to say. \n\nIn hind=\r\n sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an intellectual e=\r\nxplanation for something that I myself have not yet intellectually understo=\r\nod.\n\nI did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know wh=\r\nat do say or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledg=\r\ne or understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri =\r\nKrishna might judge him differently for several of His acts which could not=\r\n be intellectually explained. Having observed him in person with questions =\r\nseveral times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that=\r\n it was not true. \n\nBest regards, \n-Siva. \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

In fact, this is a qu=\r\nestion that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know hi=\r\nm. In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that s=\r\nomebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures,=\r\n who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning,=\r\n who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teac=\r\nhing him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the w=\r\norld on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining some simple quest=\r\nions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did =\r\nnot debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article=\r\n of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Truth to those that are r=\r\neady. He is not interested in anything else. He answers only when there is =\r\nsincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polit=\r\ne words and let it pass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the quest=\r\nions that were raised in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri =\r\nin his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One may ask why=\r\n then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of the meetin=\r\ng was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri =\r\ndid justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that wa=\r\ns supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were ready to benefit from=\r\n it from the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, esp=\r\necially those among us that are intellectually curious about spirituality t=\r\nhan practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first and=\r\n explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will b=\r\ne big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say very si=\r\nmple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence would c=\r\nonvey what needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master may =\r\nnot be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept for =\r\nanother, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence. A M=\r\nasters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are secondary and =\r\noptional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words is to create inner =\r\nsilence or illumination and if that is not created, there is no point in ta=\r\nlking! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immense blessing to be in t=\r\nhe presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else. We ga=\r\nin immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead of our mind. In Sr=\r\ni Ramakrishna&#39; s life, there are innumerable examples of very simple people=\r\n benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectuals would de=\r\nbate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when he cou=\r\nntered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and say wha=\r\nt would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would have been for=\r\n a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and ignoramu=\r\ns!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or=\r\n even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dange=\r\nrous as it will become yet another mental concept and will actually be a hi=\r\nndrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for=\r\n a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spi=\r\nrituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicu=\r\nously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt;    Siv=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi=\r\n14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Nice mail.

I occ=\r\nasionally visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and =\r\nthe below email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spirit=\r\nual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want =\r\nto clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n There are several paths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda=\r\n. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL i=\r\ns a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it i=\r\nn any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it,=\r\n it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatC=\r\nhitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadh=\r\nak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma =\r\nyoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan K=\r\nriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kr=\r\niya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind and preparing for medit=\r\nation and doing other spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest o=\r\nf the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya remov=\r\nes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas=\r\n to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN co=\r\nurse and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance cour=\r\nses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices incl=\r\nude all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught=\r\n in Art of Living course, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course,=\r\n etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study=\r\n and imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gi=\r\nta and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commenta=\r\nry on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so ta=\r\npes and the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 3=\r\n3 DVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; re=\r\ncommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those=\r\n that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of=\r\n AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sa=\r\nnkeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack=\r\n of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my pers=\r\nonal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master liv=\r\ning in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devote=\r\nes in every step of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. S=\r\neveral get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice=\r\n), some in person and several via various other ways. However, to get these=\r\n guidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that sta=\r\nge, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries =\r\non various Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage whe=\r\nre conscious inner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of=\r\n a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will =\r\nduring meditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, bu=\r\nt act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and =\r\nwhen needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left the=\r\nir body as having achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri=\r\n Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt t=\r\nhem when they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging=\r\n money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. =\r\nNeither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory prof=\r\nits. All the proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by voluntee=\r\nrs. Many of the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and=\r\n millions worth in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri =\r\nRavishankar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including =\r\nSri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions =\r\nto bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowl=\r\nedge needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sen=\r\nior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help=\r\n or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Ka=\r\nshmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and =\r\nDivine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is char=\r\nged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience sho=\r\nwed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more =\r\ndiligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be den=\r\nied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part =\r\nof organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where peop=\r\nle took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Wh=\r\nenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their ow=\r\nn pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the vi=\r\nctims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) =\r\nThis is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt t=\r\no the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone t=\r\nurn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyon=\r\ne. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, =\r\nwe are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt;\n\n\n \n\n\n      \r\n--0-1983500497-1258597085=:51301\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,seri=\r\nf; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;lord krishna knew past and future and knew destiny was=\r\n not to fight with jarsandh and he ran away to let karma do its work&lt;br&gt;ram=\r\nana maharishi was never the head of the ashram. people built it around him&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;he has no belongings. he even did not have any sisyas and he told people=\r\n had him as a guru and he did not have any disciples&lt;br&gt;being cornered by a=\r\n terrorist religious leader of a religion which swami vivekanada has alread=\r\ny proclaimed that prophet has spoilt a whole civilisation&nbsp;&nbsp; for h=\r\nis personal benefit.&lt;br&gt;i lost faith in him after i read the youtube debate=\r\n last month&lt;br&gt;i used to recommend his yoga class and sudarsana kriya&lt;br&gt;bu=\r\nt hereafter i will not&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16,\n=\r\n 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new r=\r\noman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot; size=3D&quot;=\r\n2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sc=\r\nhinnas &lt;schinnas@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;=\r\nTo:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thu, November 19, 2009 4:20:56 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: AOL: Seam=\r\nless blend of Raja, Karma, Bhakti and Gnana Yogas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;meta http-=\r\nequiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;disp=\r\nlay: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n     =\r\n &lt;p&gt;Dear Shri. Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;\n    I was giving an explanation from my under=\r\nstanding, but it was still at my mental level. The actions of an englighten=\r\ned master established in Sahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental=\r\n concepts of how things should be. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor example, when Sri Krishna =\r\n- an Avatar of the highest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasa=\r\nndh attacked Mathura instead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krish=\r\nna himself years later would advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight=\r\n. Can we give a satisfying intellectual answer to it if people raise questi=\r\nons?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSri Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was s=\r\nomething like: If Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be =\r\na limitation in itself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary fo=\r\nr a larger and more complete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcours=\r\ne have to read the original to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnother instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up =\r\nRamana Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bo=\r\nre it with equanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and =\r\none can intellectually argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram a=\r\nnd inmates from the thieves. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBesides, there were certain things t=\r\nhat I did not want to put in an public email. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSome clues - AOL si=\r\nlverjubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya =\r\ntogether happened around Feb 16, 2006. There were several threats from cert=\r\nain militants from one community about planting bombs or disrupting it in o=\r\nther ways police security provided was not sufficient for that sized gather=\r\ning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe concerned debate where lot of SIMI members were among the=\r\n participants happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 2006.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSome peo=\r\nple believe Sri Sri&#39;s presence in the event changed the heart of some miscr=\r\neants.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMany does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings with=\r\n the future head of state of a superpower few minutes before the meeting wa=\r\ns to happen. Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained log=\r\nically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty abou=\r\nt an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain =\r\nthem in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much h=\r\nigher.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental u=\r\nnderstanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI d=\r\no not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I have said ev=\r\nerything I had to say. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn hind sight, I realize that I should not=\r\n have ventured to give an intellectual explanation for something that I mys=\r\nelf have not yet intellectually understood.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI did want to object t=\r\no some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what do say or was confused. =\r\nIt was a judgement of those without any knowledge or understanding of Sri S=\r\nri, just as someone who does not understand Sri Krishna might judge him dif=\r\nferently for several of His acts which could not be intellectually explaine=\r\nd. Having observed him in person with questions several times tricker than =\r\nwhat Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that it was not true. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nBest regards, &lt;br&gt;\n-Siva. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha=\r\n P.V.R.

In fact, this is a question that was rai=\r\nsed by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if one =\r\nlooks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri Sr=\r\ni, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an authorit=\r\ny on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the Bh=\r\nagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and who g=\r\nives impromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all topics =\r\nunder the sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are about=\r\n his home turf?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did=\r\n not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an articl=\r\ne of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Truth to those that are =\r\nready. He is not interested in anything else. He answers only when there is=\r\n sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some poli=\r\nte words and let it pass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the ques=\r\ntions that were raised in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri=\r\n in his various commentaries &amp; discourses year ago!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was=\r\n? The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism a=\r\nnd Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment =\r\nof the very thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that w=\r\nere ready to benefit from it from the audience would have benefited. &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ************&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The below=\r\n part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, especially th=\r\nose among us that are intellectually curious about spirituality than practi=\r\ncing it. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience=\r\n first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, th=\r\nere will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only s=\r\nay very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presen=\r\nce would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A M=\r\naster may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental co=\r\nncept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in si=\r\nlence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are seco=\r\nndary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words is to cre=\r\nate inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, there is no p=\r\noint in talking! &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and =\r\nan immense blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is =\r\nSri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Be=\r\ning instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s life, there are innumerable =\r\nexamples of very simple people benefiting from his mere looks &amp; presenc=\r\ne while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of=\r\n a lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna=\r\n would feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What=\r\n a disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakri=\r\nshna as an illiterate and ignoramus!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Without a=\r\nn accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of a=\r\nn experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will becom=\r\ne yet another mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak=\r\n. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created=\r\n by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Th=\r\nings like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that=\r\n way less dangerous. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;    Siva.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, rajars=\r\nhi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nDear Siva,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasionally visit this forum. I hap=\r\npened to see several emails about AOL and the below email from Shri. Narasi=\r\nmha.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and=\r\n as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few =\r\nthings to the extent of my understanding.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of =\r\nSat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devot=\r\nion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That doe=\r\ns not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo=\r\n would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly e=\r\nmerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slow=\r\nly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a s=\r\neamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritua=\r\nl practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commo=\r\nnly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing a=\r\nnd settling of the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spirit=\r\nual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right atti=\r\ntude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga as=\r\nanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DS=\r\nN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance =\r\ncourses fall under this category.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya,=\r\n mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance cours=\r\nes, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and im=\r\nbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and =\r\nBhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on a=\r\nll of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and=\r\n the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD e=\r\npisodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory =\r\nfor those that strive to become Art of Living teachers.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and S=\r\neva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standar=\r\nd feature of AOL satsangs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack o=\r\nf a Sadhguru at every stage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Let me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is =\r\na fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable=\r\n of guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without havin=\r\ng to be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I my=\r\nself had that experience twice), some in person and several via various oth=\r\ner ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Maste=\r\nr is essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elabor=\r\nate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to =\r\nguide disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be=\r\n established.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of t=\r\nhe senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high =\r\norder capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during medita=\r\ntion. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as chan=\r\nnels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept =\r\nthose that left their body as having achieved highest realization such as S=\r\nri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human =\r\ntendency to doubt them when they are in physical form.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: =\r\nAOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor=\r\n its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go=\r\n to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full tim=\r\ne teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in prope=\r\nrty to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither need=\r\ns all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went throug=\r\nh very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge t=\r\no the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be reveale=\r\nd to maximum number of people.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without =\r\nany help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North =\r\nEast, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but l=\r\nove and Divine Grace as their aid.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed=\r\n that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more dil=\r\nigently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied=\r\n a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of =\r\norganizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people =\r\ntook courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whene=\r\nver natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own p=\r\nocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the victi=\r\nms. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position.=\r\n It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still ma=\r\ny have some doership in them.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards an=\r\nd express the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as =\r\none follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Siva.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;meta http-eq=\r\nuiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- cg16.c4.mai=\r\nl.gq1.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Tue Nov  3 19:26:09 PST 2009 --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1983500497-1258597085=:51301--\r\n\n"}}
