In all respects, I a=\r\nm bound\nto you.=E2=80=99\nThat is, after self-surrender, he must resign hims=\r\nelf to the divine will,\nwithout any reservations.\n\n259 He that has surrende=\r\nred himself will be at peace, remembering that He\n[God] is the bearer of th=\r\ne world=E2=80=99s burden. The one that bears the burden\nhimself will be\nrid=\r\niculous, like the figure on the temple-tower appearing to bear the tower\non=\r\n its own shoulders.\n\n260 As one travelling in a carriage puts down his lugg=\r\nage in the carriage\nitself and completes his journey, so should he resign h=\r\nis own [samsaric]\nburden to God and complete his life in the world.\n\nThose =\r\nwho take on themselves the task of reforming the world or of\nalleviating th=\r\ne sufferings of others are dealt with next.\n\n261 The wise one should resign=\r\n to God his cares concerning the good of the\nworld, just as he resigns to H=\r\nim his cares about his own body and family.\n\n262 The ripe devotee must pass=\r\n his time, patiently enduring whatever happens\nto him, whether pleasant or =\r\nunpleasant or otherwise, without yielding to\nsorrow or joy, with his heart =\r\nabsorbed in Him.\n\n263 When the ego dies, having been swallowed by divine gr=\r\nace, the devotee=E2=80=99s\nself-surrender becomes true and complete.\n\nThis =\r\nhas been said in the language of the intellect. But the actual truth of\nthi=\r\ns consummation transcends the intellect and is hence not easy to convey\nin =\r\nwords. Indeed, the notion of self-surrender is absorbed from the\nstandpoint=\r\n of the absolute truth.\n\n264 As would be the offering [to Ganesa] of a port=\r\nion, taken from an image\nof Ganesa made of jaggery, so is the surrender of =\r\none=E2=80=99s self to God, since\nthere is no self apart from Him.\n\n265 Sinc=\r\ne the Self is the Supreme Being Himself, by whom, how and to whom is\nthe su=\r\nrrender to be made? True self-surrender is only the extinction of the\nego, =\r\nby which the sense of being different from Him arises.\n\n266 =E2=80=98If you=\r\n desire to give yourself to God, then first seek out and know\nyour Self. Th=\r\ne gift of oneself to God will be accomplished in this way.=E2=80=99 So\nsaid=\r\n the most holy one.\n\nThe truth about namaskara (prostration) is the same as=\r\n self-surrender. This\nis explained next.\n\n267 The truth of namaskara also i=\r\ns only the perfect giving up of the\nego-sense. Right awareness, self-surren=\r\nder and namaskara, all these three\nare one and the same.\nThus it is shown t=\r\nhat God does not become an object of vision. Neither does\nHe become an obje=\r\nct of knowledge. This is shown next.\n\n268 As God does not become an object =\r\nof vision, neither does He become an\nobject of knowledge. Since He transcen=\r\nds the mind, the mind will know Him\n[if at all] only wrongly.\n\n269 Since th=\r\ne real Self, which is consciousness, is the same as God, and\nsince there is=\r\n no consciousness apart from Him, [it follows that] there is\nno one to know=\r\n Him, other than He, nor does He become an object of\nknowledge.\n\nThe real S=\r\nelf is the eternal subject, and hence He can never become an\nobject, says B=\r\nhagavan.\n\n270 The source of the light of consciousness that exists in the m=\r\nind is just\nthe real Self. Hence, apart from Him, there is no such thing as=\r\n mind\nexisting as something real.\n\n271 Like the sun, the consciousness that=\r\n is the Self shines in the Heart by\nits own light. By its light the mind =\r\n=E2=80=93 which by itself is insentient =E2=80=93\nappears as sentient, like=\r\n the moon.\n\n272 Since [mind-] consciousness is not the true nature of the m=\r\nind, it goes\ninto latency in deep sleep. [But] the real Self never goes int=\r\no latency\nsince consciousness is its very nature.\n\nBut the mind has the pow=\r\ner of veiling the Self.\n\n273 The mind always veils [for itself] the real na=\r\nture of the Self, both in\ndream and in waking. Becoming latent in deep slee=\r\np and wholly extinguished\nin the supreme state, how can it ever know Him, w=\r\nho is the sole reality?\n\nWhat then is =E2=80=98knowing God=E2=80=99?\n\n274 T=\r\nhere is the pronouncement of the most holy one that the true knowing of\nGod=\r\n is simply the mind becoming one with Him in the natural state by seeking\nt=\r\nhe source wherefrom it has come into being.\n\nThus the pair of God and the i=\r\nndividual soul is resolved. The conclusion is\nas follows.\n\n275 What one has=\r\n to do is obtain perfect poise in unity with the Supreme\nBeing, whether by =\r\ndevotion or by the quest of the real Self, with the clear\nunderstanding tha=\r\nt God and the soul are not distinct entities in reality.\n\nThe next pair to =\r\nbe discussed is that of knowledge and ignorance.\n\n276 There is a two-fold i=\r\ngnorance, named as knowledge and ignorance, which\nis experienced by those n=\r\not aware of the real Self. This pair is unreal just\nlike all else.\n\n277 The=\r\n two are inseparable. Neither exists without the other, and because\nboth ar=\r\nise from ignorance of the Self, both are equally ignorance.\n\nWorldly knowle=\r\ndge and worldly ignorance are both ignorance for the reason\nstated here. Th=\r\nis is explained further.\n\n278 Everyone, being ignorant of his own real Self=\r\n, seeks to know what is\nnot-Self. The relative knowledge [acquired in this =\r\nway] is an outcome of\nthis ignorance. Hence, says our Guru, it is only igno=\r\nrance.\n\n279 Whatever knowledge one acquires by the intellect and the senses=\r\n, if it\nis acquired without first knowing the truth of the one that arises,=\r\n saying\n=E2=80=98I am the knower=E2=80=99, is all wrong knowledge.\n\n280 He =\r\nthat does not know the Self might consider the world, which is\nunreal, to b=\r\ne real, and he will look upon his own real Self, which\ntranscends the world=\r\n, as an individual soul contained in the world.\n\n281 The intellect, the sen=\r\nses and the mind are only the servants of the\nprimary ignorance. Hence, the=\r\n worldly modes of =E2=80=98proof=E2=80=99 serve only to delude\nthe creature=\r\n.\n\n282 If the ego dies by the quest, =E2=80=98Whence arises the ego, the ex=\r\nperiencer of\nthe two, knowledge and ignorance?=E2=80=99 with it will be ext=\r\ninguished this pair\n[knowledge and ignorance].\n\n283 Right awareness is only=\r\n dwelling in the natural state of the Self, after\nthe extinction of the ego=\r\n. In that state, which is free from duality, these\ntwo manifestations of ig=\r\nnorance, which belong to the worldly life, do not\nsurvive.\n\n284 The sages [=\r\nBuddhas] call that the state of right awareness. In it there\nis neither kno=\r\nwledge nor ignorance. That is the highest state, in which\nthere is nothing,=\r\n whether sentient or insentient, other than the Self.\n\n285 The illiterate, =\r\nthe literate and the =E2=80=98knower of the Self=E2=80=99 are all three\nequ=\r\nally ignorant. The third one also is ignorant, because for him there is\nnot=\r\nhing knowable other than the Self.\n\nThis was what Bhagavan said. The first =\r\ntwo are ignorant because they do not\nknow the Self. The sage is ignorant fo=\r\nr a different reason, which is here\nstated. He also said:\n\n286 That one who=\r\n has become established in his own natural state is adorable\nby all, whethe=\r\nr men or angels. As he is not distinct from the Supreme Being,\nhe is also f=\r\nit to be adored [as God] by the seekers of deliverance.\n\nA doubt raised by =\r\nsome disciples is next answered.\n\n287 Not knowing that this worldly knowled=\r\nge is only ignorance, some ask:\n=E2=80=98Let ignorance come to an end in th=\r\ne supreme state, but why should knowledge\nalso cease?=E2=80=99\n\n288 In the =\r\nsupreme state there is nothing to be known, neither a knower, nor\nknowledge=\r\n [of objects]. Just as pairs are absent in that state, so the\ntriads also a=\r\nre absent.\n\n289 In the supreme state that Self shines alone, free from both=\r\n knowledge\nand ignorance. Since it is there as pure consciousness, without =\r\nchange, how\ncan that state be a void?\n\nThat the state is not a void is ment=\r\nioned here because some believe that\nthere is no reality beyond the world.\n=\r\n\n290 There the Self shines by its own light of consciousness, as the sole\nr=\r\neality, which is bliss. In that supreme state there is no reality to shed\nl=\r\night on it, nor anything =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99 that could shine by its li=\r\nght.\n\n291 That consciousness light, which is its nature, neither rises nor =\r\nsets,\nbut is ever the same [without change]. It is by borrowing a minute pa=\r\nrticle\nof its consciousness that the mind appears conscious.\n\n292 Disciples=\r\n of non-sages, fearing that in the supreme state the Self will\ncease to be,=\r\n wish to go to some other celestial world for the sake of\neternal happiness=\r\n.\n\n293 As this world is unreal, so the other worlds also are unreal. For th=\r\ne\nsage [who is in the supreme state] the Self is itself the world, and henc=\r\ne\nthat world is real in its own right.\n\nHence, sages are free from all worl=\r\ndly attractions.\n\n294 =E2=80=98What do we need wealth or offspring for when=\r\n the Self is itself the\nworld?=E2=80=99 So thinking, the sages, whose desir=\r\nes have all subsided, care not\nfor action, nor for inaction.\n\n295 That Self=\r\n, which is consciousness, is alone real. The consciousness that\nhas the wor=\r\nld-form is ignorance [not true knowledge]. Since the world does\nnot exist a=\r\npart from that world-consciousness, it is unreal.\n\nThe question then arises=\r\n, =E2=80=98Is this ignorance real?=E2=80=99 It is answered in the\nfollowing=\r\n way:\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e64eed265f941104a0168f70\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;M=\r\nARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;258 The self-surrender is truly =\r\nmade by him who always has the feeling, =E2=80=98Let all things happen acco=\r\nrding to your will.

As he is not distinct from the Supreme Being, he is also fit to b=\r\ne adored [as God] by the seekers of deliverance.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;A doubt raised by =\r\nsome disciples is next answered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;287 Not knowing that this worldly k=\r\nnowledge is only ignorance, some ask: =E2=80=98Let ignorance come to an end=\r\n in the supreme state, but why should knowledge also cease?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;288 In the supreme state there is nothi=\r\nng to be known, neither a knower, nor knowledge [of objects]. Just as pairs=\r\n are absent in that state, so the triads also are absent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n28=\r\n9 In the supreme state that Self shines alone, free from both knowledge and=\r\n ignorance. Since it is there as pure consciousness, without change, how ca=\r\nn that state be a void?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That the state is not a void is mentioned he=\r\nre because some believe that there is no reality beyond the world.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n290 There the Self shines by its own light of consciousness, as the sole re=\r\nality, which is bliss. In that supreme state there is no reality to shed li=\r\nght on it, nor anything =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99 that could shine by its lig=\r\nht.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n291 That consciousness light, which is its nature, neither rise=\r\ns nor sets, but is ever the same [without change]. It is by borrowing a min=\r\nute particle of its consciousness that the mind appears conscious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2=\r\n92 Disciples of non-sages, fearing that in the supreme state the Self will =\r\ncease to be, wish to go to some other celestial world for the sake of etern=\r\nal happiness.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;293 As this world is unreal, so the other worlds also=\r\n are unreal. For the sage [who is in the supreme state] the Self is itself =\r\nthe world, and hence that world is real in its own right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hence, sag=\r\nes are free from all worldly attractions.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;294 =E2=80=98What do we n=\r\need wealth or offspring for when the Self is itself the world?=E2=80=99 So =\r\nthinking, the sages, whose desires have all subsided, care not for action, =\r\nnor for inaction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;295 That Self, w=\r\nhich is consciousness, is alone real. The consciousness that has the world-=\r\nform is ignorance [not true knowledge]. Since the world does not exist apar=\r\nt from that world-consciousness, it is unreal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The question =\r\nthen arises, =E2=80=98Is this ignorance real?=E2=80=99 It is answered in th=\r\ne following way:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;div style=3D&quot;CLE=\r\nAR: both; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 87%; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); LINE-HE=\r\nIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016e64eed265f941104a0168f70--\r\n\n"}}
