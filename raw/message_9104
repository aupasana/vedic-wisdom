Blue comments are\nfor neural association only and are not from the boo=\r\nk.\n\n\n\n    * Result of pleasure and pain is what is called man&#39;s &quot;character&quot;=\r\n.\n    * The external world is simply the suggestion, the occasion, which\nse=\r\nts you to study your own mind, but the object of the study is always\nyour o=\r\nwn mind.\n    * There are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate=\r\n, the\nsum total, of a large number of smaller works. (seashore sound &lt;-- so=\r\nund\nof millions of minute waves) Every pulsation of the heart is making is\n=\r\nwork; certain works we feel and they become tangible to us, they are, at\nth=\r\ne same time, the aggregate of a number of small works.\n    * Every fool bec=\r\nomes hero at one time or another. Watch a man do his\nmost common actions; t=\r\nhose will tell you the real character of a great\nman.\n    * The Karma in ef=\r\nfects on character is the most tremendous power that\nman has to deal with.\n=\r\n\n    * All actions are manifestation of will. Will is made by character,\nch=\r\naracter is manufactured by Karma, which is manifestation of\nwill.(circular =\r\nreference?)\n\n    * A man may buy all the books in the world, but he will on=\r\nly be able\nto read those he deserves, and this deserving is produced by kar=\r\nma.\n    * Our karma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate.\n=\r\n    * What is use of learning how to work? Everyone works! But, there is\nsu=\r\nch a thing as frittering away our energies. Knowing how to do work\nthat wil=\r\nl bring greatest results.\n    * There cannot be work without motive\n    * W=\r\nork for work&#39;s sake. He is the highest gainer, more paying in\nphysical valu=\r\ne as well.\n    * Love, truth and unselfishness are not only moral figures, =\r\nbut are\nhighest ideals because they are such manifestations of power.\n    *=\r\n Restraint will produce a gigantic will, that character which makes\na world=\r\n move.\n    * When wanting to help, never think what the mans attitude shoul=\r\nd be\ntoward you.\n\n    * Ideal man is he who in midst of greatest silence fi=\r\nnds intensest\nactivity, and vice versa: the secret of restraint.\n\n    * Tam=\r\nas: inactivity\n\n    * Rajas: activity\n    * Sattva: calm, sweet, gentle, co=\r\nntrolling both T and R\n    * Plants, animal, men all governed by these 3 T,=\r\nR,S\n\n    * Karma yoga has to deal with these 3 elements\n\n    * Morality and=\r\n duty: according to mental constitution or the\ndifferent plane of existence=\r\n, duty and morality may vary. (There is no\nuniversal morality and duty).\n  =\r\n  * There are gradations of duty and morality: what is duty of one\nstate of=\r\n line in one set of circumstances will not be that of another.\n    * The ma=\r\nn who has begun to hate himself, the gate to degeneration has\nbeen opened!\n=\r\n    * To advance, we must have\n\n    *  faith in ourselves first (1) and\n\n  =\r\n  * then faith in God (2) and\n\n    * not hate our self.\n\n    * Two extremes=\r\n are very similar. (too low of light, or too bright:\nyou can&#39;t see)\n\n    * =\r\nLike was there is different in resistance (can strike, but do not)\nand non-=\r\nresistance ( can resist but do not)\n\n    * One who resist (not from weaknes=\r\ns, but willingly) commits a sin.\n\n    * Inactivity should be avoided by all=\r\n means. (tamas?)Activity means\nresistance.\n    * Until you&#39;ve passed throug=\r\nh that activity , (fulfill the desire)\nwill come the time when you know thi=\r\ns are little things, and you come to\nstate of calmness/serenity.\n    * Unit=\r\ny in variety is the plan of creation. (religion, caste,\nspecies)\n    * I sh=\r\nould not be judged by your standards, nor you be mine (apple to\napple compa=\r\nrison)\n    * Helping man\n\n    * spiritual knowledge is the highest help tha=\r\nt can be given to him.\n(give man a fish vs. teach to fish)\n    * Next to sp=\r\niritual comes intellectual help.\n    * Next to intellectual help is physica=\r\nl help.\n\n    * Non-attachment to work\n\n    * Samskara =3D=3D=3D tendency (d=\r\nependent probability(not a chance based))\n\n    * Every ripple in mind marks=\r\n an impression, even when we are not\nobvious on surface, these marks are su=\r\nfficiently strong to work beneath\nthe surface, sub-consciously.\n    * What =\r\nwe are at each moment =3D sum total of all impressions up to\nthat point in =\r\nmind (including ones from past lives.)  this is what\nreally what is meant b=\r\ny character.\n    * Bad marks of mind should be conquered by fresh waves of =\r\ngood mark\n(Present is most powerful&lt;-Yoga Vasistha), until those that are e=\r\nvil are\nalmost disappeared/subdued. But after that good tendencies have als=\r\no to\nbe conquered. The attached must become unattached! (when I take one\nth=\r\nrone out of my hand using another throne, I must then throw away\n&quot;both&quot; thr=\r\nones).\n\n    * Work , but let not the action or thought produce a deep impre=\r\nssion\nin mind/soul.\n\n    * Attachments are made because of associations (ne=\r\nural net?) if I\nremember someone just with one  glimpse and found hundred o=\r\nf kindred\nthings inside my mind, such being the case, a deep impression wil=\r\nl be\nimmediately made upon mind.\n    * Work as if you were stranger in this=\r\n land, work incessantly, but do\nnot bind yourself.\n\n    * The very reason f=\r\nor nature&#39;s existence is for the education of\nsoul; it has no other meaning=\r\n.\n\n    * With love there is no painful reaction.\n    * If you can incessant=\r\nly take that position that you are a giver,\nthat everything given by you is=\r\n a free offering to the world, without\nany thought of return, it will not b=\r\nring attachment. Attachment only\ncomes when we expect something!\n\n    * Dut=\r\ny\n\n    * Do the duty which is our by birth and we&#39;ve done that, do the duty=\r\n\nthat is by our position.\n    * Duty is seldom sweet. Duty is sweet only th=\r\nrough love.\n    * A man should not be judged by nature of his duties but by=\r\n the\nmanner in which he does them.\n\n    * Our duty to others mean helping o=\r\nthers, doing good to the world.\nBut we really only help ourselves. This wor=\r\nld is not made that we should\ncome and help! World is perfect (normalized, =\r\nreached local/global\nmaxima), it is perfectly fitted to meet its ends. It d=\r\noes not need any\nhelp from us, Yet we must do good.\n\n    * Be grateful when=\r\n a helping opportunity arise! So that helping cause\n, you help yourself by =\r\nbeing good. It is the only way we can become\nperfect.\n    * Always remember=\r\n curly tail of dog when you have tendency to become\nfanatic. You need not w=\r\norry or make yourself sleepless, the world will\ngo on.\n    * It is level-he=\r\naded man, calm man of good judgment and cool nerves,\nof great sympathy and =\r\nlove, who does good work.\n    * (Same space/time) Good mind/thought, vs. ba=\r\nd mind/ thought resonate\neach other.. If you are tune to a frequency, someo=\r\nne broadcasting on\nthat frequency, you will pick that up.\n    * (Across tim=\r\ne) thought waves may travel hundreds of years until they\nmeet with an objec=\r\nt with which they vibrate in unison (resonance).\n    * When man is doing ev=\r\nil action, he has brought his mind to certain\nstate of tension (resonance )=\r\n, and all waves corresponding to that\ntension that are already in atmospher=\r\ne, will struggle to enter his mind!\nSo, this has two fold danger (receiver+=\r\n transmitter), first we open\nourselves to all the evil influences surroundi=\r\nng us; second we create\nsimilar waves which will affect others!!!\n\n    * Th=\r\ne action one has done cannot be destroyed unit it has borne\nfruit!\n\n    * A=\r\n perfect life is a contraction in terms. This compound struggle\nbetween som=\r\nething inside and external world is what we call life.\n    * The highest id=\r\neal is eternal and entire self-abnegation. Karma yoga\nleads to that.\n    * =\r\nPravritti (revolving towards you being the center: selfish) : evil\n(me my m=\r\nine)\n    * Nivritti (revolving away from me : selfless) : good .\n    * Self=\r\nishness is world, unselfishness is God.\n    * All actions bear good and evi=\r\nl at the same time! We cannot put a\nline of demarcation and say this action=\r\n is entirely good and this\nentirely evil. We cannot breathe or live without=\r\n injuring others.\n    * Any action that is not done for your own sake, what=\r\never it be, will\nhave no effect on you! Any action that you do for yourself=\r\n will bring an\neffect on you!\n\n    * Helping ourselves via Work\n\n    * Give=\r\n up idea of attachment (as an ordinary nurse, who take care of\nyour kid, bu=\r\nt walks away when done.)\n    * Do not mix in the fray: hold yourself as wit=\r\nness only!\n\n    * Give up fruits of work unto the lord\n    * The only duty =\r\nis to be unattached and to work as free beings\n\n    * Everything you do und=\r\ner compulsion is attachment\n\n    * Don&#39;t get attached. Its attachment comes=\r\n all our pain.\n\n    * Don&#39;t get pride in that someone is dependent upon you=\r\n.\n    * No-one in this universe depends upon us. They are all helped and\nwi=\r\nll be helped even if millions of us were not here.\n    * Helping other is a=\r\n privilege.\n\n    * World does not require any help from you. When you have =\r\ntrained\nyour nerves and your muscles to this idea, there will be no reactio=\r\nn in\nthe form of pain.\n    * Nothing in the universe has power over you unt=\r\nil you admit it.!!\n    * So by non-attachment, you deny the power of anythi=\r\nng to act upon\nyou.\n    * First hear, then think, and then practice. Practi=\r\nce is the key.\nMany things that you do not understand , by constant hearing=\r\n , will be\nmade clear.\n    * The explanation of everything is in yourself. =\r\nNo one was ever\ntaught by another; each one of us has to teach himself!!

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; People may misunderstand the word &quot;mokShayiShyAmi&quot; (I shall liberate)=\r\n\nin that verse based on what their conditioning tells them liberation is.\nT=\r\no get a correct understanding, one may need to combine knowledge from\nother=\r\n scriptures.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; As an example, if the body of one having an attachment=\r\n to the body is\nafflicted with cancer, one may see it as a problem. Because=\r\n one feels\nattachment and responsibility towards the body, one may be think=\r\ning\nabout how to fix it and may get agitated. So, one is not free from the\n=\r\nnegative repercussions of that cancer. But, when Ramana Maharshi or\nRamakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa had cancer, they did not view it as a problem\nand displaye=\r\nd the same attitude and mental equanimity. So, while their\n*bodies* experie=\r\nnced the repercussions of that cancer, &quot;they&quot; were free\nfrom them.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\nIf one has surrendered one&#39;s sense of duty/responsibility towards\n*everythi=\r\nng* as Lord says in that verse (&quot;sarva dharmAn parityajya&quot;),\nwhere &quot;everyth=\r\ning&quot; inlcudes body, name, wife, children, properties etc,\nthen anything bad=\r\n (or good) happening to those entities will not touch\none or bind one. One =\r\nis &quot;free&quot; from those happenings. *That* liberation\nis what Lord says he sha=\r\nll give and the pre-condition is to give up any\nsense of duty/responsibilit=\r\ny towards anything.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Though some people interpret &quot;dharma&quot; in this verse =\r\nas a religious\npath, the real meaning of dharma is &quot;duty, that which is cor=\r\nrect&quot;. We\nhave a sense of responsibility towards so many entities, stemming=\r\n from\nour conditioning (vasana). This includes a sense of responsibility\nto=\r\nwards body, name, wife, children, parents, relatives, community,\ncountry, r=\r\neligion, subjects of study (e.g. Jyotish) etc etc. Every sense\nof &quot;I need t=\r\no do this&quot;, whether noble or evil, comes from one&#39;s\nconditioning and *binds=\r\n* one. If one surrenders all these, i.e.\neffectively one surrenders one&#39;s e=\r\nntire conditioning, at Lord&#39;s feet and\naccepts whatever happens to one as g=\r\nod&#39;s prasad, then one is liberated.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Based on the &quot;momentum&quot; from ac=\r\ntions before liberation, one may face\nvarious life situations even after li=\r\nberation. In one case, one may get\ncancer and die. In another case, one may=\r\n roam the world and spread\nSanatana Dharma. In another case, one may sit in=\r\n a cave and meditate for\n10,000 more years. In another case, one may roam t=\r\nhe streets looking\nlike a mad person. In another case, one may continue to =\r\nwork as a day\nlabourer. In another case, one may destroy a kingdom in a bat=\r\ntle. And so\non. In all these cases, the liberated being has surrendered all=\r\n\npreferences, all likes and dislikes, all agendas, attachments and sense\nof=\r\n resposibility towards everything one has (body, name, wife, children\netc a=\r\nnd all attributes of the body-mind complex that once ruled the\nroost) and e=\r\nngages in spontaneous actions based on the circumstances one\nfinds oneself =\r\nin, based on pre-existing momentum. Nothing that happens\nto one binds one a=\r\nnd nothing that one does binds one.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Liberation does not mean that a=\r\nll of one&#39;s belongings (body, name,\nfamily, community etc) are &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;=\r\nwell&quot;. Nor does it mean that one\ndoes nothing. Things may keep happening to=\r\n one and one may keep doing\nthings. Yet, one is untouched by them, like a w=\r\nater drop on a lotus\nleaf, because one has no desires, demands, preferences=\r\n or agendas and\naccepts whatever Lord gives.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One who tells Krishna, &quot;I =\r\nsurrender to you. I will not follow any\nreligion or rituals or gods and jus=\r\nt pray to you. So forgive all my sins\nand make sure that only good things b=\r\nefall my body, my name, my family\netc [because I really care about them and=\r\n any damage to them will upset\nme]&quot; has missed the point big time! The subl=\r\nime verse you referred to is\nlike the culmination of entire Bhagavad Gita a=\r\nnd is the essence of all\nUpanishads.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  =\r\n*=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One word of caution. IMHO, what fol=\r\nlows is far more relevant to most\nreaders of this writeup than what lies ab=\r\nove!\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; This verse is the essence of Self-knowledge. But most people o=\r\nf this\nera are unlikely to realize Self (until the end of this yuga cycle).=\r\n So\nmy suggestion is to set more reasonable goals. It is ok if you haven&#39;t\n=\r\nsurrendered all of your dharmas to Lord.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; !!!!! In fact, even if you=\r\n try, you will probably end up misusing that\nnotion to run away from most o=\r\nf your higher (and selfless) dharmas and\nyet end up sticking to your lowest=\r\n and most selfish dharmas (e.g. dharma\ntowards body and its survival instin=\r\nct, very tough to shake off). That\nis useless. !!!!!\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; No wonder Veda=\r\nnta comes at the end of all Veda and the verse above\ncomes after so many ch=\r\napters on so many other things. Don&#39;t jump to it\nright away!\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; First =\r\n*expand* your sense of self and your sense of responsibility and\nattachment=\r\n to be more inclusive. Current body-mind complex we inhabit is\na very limit=\r\ned notion of self. Expand it to family, then to community,\nthen to town, th=\r\nen to nation etc. Or may be to a large community of\npeople with certain att=\r\nributes. Basically, try to put others before you,\nlearn to sacrifice and en=\r\ngage in more selfless actions than selfish\nactions. Not everyone may be lib=\r\nerated in this life, but everyone can\nmake SOME progress towards it!\n&gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =C2 =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;______________=\r\n__________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Sriraman Annaswamy sriraman@...\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;Jyotis=\r\nhWritings-owner@yahoogroups.com&quot;\nJyotishWritings-owner@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;C=\r\nc: Vedic Wisdom vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com;\n&quot;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot; vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com;\n&quot;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&quot; Jyotis=\r\nhGroup@yahoogroups.com;\n&quot;JyotishWritings@yahoogroups.com&quot; JyotishWritings@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, March 5, 2013 1:40 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [Jyo=\r\ntishWritings] Re: Karma, Phala, Remedies, Blessings,\nCurses etc (Re: few qu=\r\nestions)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sorry Narasimha, Verse 66 of the Bhagawad Gita is very =\r\nclear isn&#39;t it\n- sarva papebyo=C2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is it your position that when =\r\nSri Krishna states sarva papebyo, he is\nexcluding prarabda karma and referr=\r\ning solely to sanchita and agami\nkarma or am I missing something?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Sriraman\n&gt; &gt;Sydney, AUS\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent from my iPad\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On 05/03/2013, at=\r\n 15:33, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

However, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits of\nsome really te=\r\nrrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that\nwe lose our balan=\r\nce and our judgment gets badly beated. This may result\nin further bad karma=\r\ns being committed in that agitated/confused state.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thus, it IS =\r\nsometimes useful to push off some really bad impending\nkarmas when one is s=\r\ntill in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer\nstate of mind in that =\r\nborrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad\nfruits better. It is even =\r\npossible theoretically that one pushes off a\nreally bad karma, makes progre=\r\nss during that borrowed\n&gt; time, reaches an equanimous state of mind, become=\r\ns liberated and then\nfaces the karma as a liberated being with a totally eq=\r\nuanimous mind that\ndoes not get agitated.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Comment 2: Prarabda ka=\r\nrma is which was already done and sanchitha\nand agami are what we going to =\r\ndo.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;My Response: Actually sanchita karmas are also karmas alrea=\r\ndy done.\nSanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are different in the s=\r\nense\nthat their fructification has already begun. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means\n=\r\n&quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; means &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund\nnoun=\r\n form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that was] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas\nare ac=\r\ntions for which the process of reaction has already begun and in\nthe pipeli=\r\nne. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas that have not\nkicked off th=\r\neir fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely. If one\nbecomes liberated =\r\nwhile living, one can merge in Cosmic Self without\nexperiencing the fruits =\r\nof sanchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha\nkarmas are already in the =\r\npipeline and need to be experienced even by a\nliberated being.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nThough fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline, even\nthey ca=\r\nn actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that there\nare agents o=\r\nf delivery at the physical and subtle level even for things\ndeep in the pip=\r\neline and hence some limited adjustment is possible.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Commen=\r\nt 3:How does nishkam karma works? In other words, when a doer\ndetaches hims=\r\nelf from an action, where does the reaction goes?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;My Response: =\r\nIf one identifies with a body-mind complex and a\nlimited sense of self-iden=\r\ntification and pursues its selfish agenda, one\nkeeps accumulating karmas. B=\r\nut, if one has minimal identification with a\nbody-mind complex to just sust=\r\nain it, pursues no agenda and engages in\nwhatever action is natural in the =\r\nsituation one is in (but not driven by\nany conditioning, i.e. agendas or de=\r\nsires or likes/dislikes), then one\nis untouched by karmas performed in that=\r\n state.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;In the words of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The acc=\r\numulated and\ncurrent actions of a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;=\r\n. In other\nwords, Sanchita karmas (piled up actions from past that have not=\r\n yet\nbegun fructifying) and aagami karmas (actions being performed right no=\r\nw)\nof a liberated being take shelted in\n&gt; Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Bra=\r\nhmanda Prakriti).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2 *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2\n=C2 =C2  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Comment 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why s=\r\nhould I pray to God? And\nif i am being\n&gt; punished for some kind of bad karm=\r\na from the past, why am i not aware\nof it? It is like getting punishment wi=\r\nthout knowing your bad deeds.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;My Response: One need not pray to=\r\n God.All one needs to do is to stop\nengaging in problematic karmas to add t=\r\no the pile of such karmas from\nthe past. More importantly, one needs to rea=\r\nch a calm and sustainable\nstate of mind in which that can be maintained eve=\r\nn in the middle of a\ntumultous hurricane caused in one&#39;s life due to seriou=\r\ns bad karmas from\nthe past. Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on=\r\n sense objects,\nmaterial world and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mind tends to=\r\n lose its\nbalance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas=\r\n and\nstarts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and\nconte=\r\nmplating various ideals and qualities that God represents can give\na shelte=\r\nr to the mind in which it can maintain some calmness, balance\nand judgment.=\r\n If that is not the case for one, perhaps one needs to\nperfect it further.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;God has no agenda to either punish you or hide the reason. God =\r\nis an\nimpartial balancer of reactions to all actions. If there is something=\r\n\nunreasonable about the reaction you are getting, it means your action\nhad =\r\na similar unreasonableness.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2 Let me turn around your question o=\r\nn being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a\nsimple question. When we cause loss or hurt to so=\r\nmeone, do we always\ntell that person why we are doing it? If not, how can w=\r\ne expect someone\nto tell us before causing loss or hurt to us? If I caused =\r\nterrible\nstrife to someone pious and pure for no reason, then Nature will u=\r\nse\nsomeone in future to cause terrible strife to me despite my piety and\npu=\r\nrity and apparently for no reason.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;In fact, what will you achie=\r\nve by knowing exactly what was the\naction that caused what is happening to =\r\nyou right now? Why is that\nuseful? More useful is your conscience (a repres=\r\nentation of God in each\nheart) that tells you right from wrong. It constant=\r\nly gives guidance on\nwhich actions will give good reactions *in future*.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Comment 5: Vasana can be for wealth, fame, power, domination (a\nst=\r\nruggle for power!) etc. Many ripus, many reasons...!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;My Respons=\r\ne: Well-said. Though we are discussing karma and karma\nphala here, the root=\r\n cause of karma is vasana in chittaakasha.\n(Chidaakaasha is the space of pu=\r\nre consciousness and chittaakaasha is\nthe space of conditioned consciousnes=\r\ns that has likes, dislikes,\ndesires, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined libera=\r\ntion as overcoming\nvasanas in Yoga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga a=\r\ns &quot;chitta\nvR^itti nirodhaH yogaH&quot; (resisting the working of conditioning is=\r\n\noneness with Cosmic Self) in Yoga Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas,\nw=\r\ne are bound. Some are dense and some are very subtle.

As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all=\r\n the\nkarmas as Homa to inner\n&gt; devas or ishta devta? He mentioned that ther=\r\ne is lesser of suffering\nif\n&gt; you do that. Who gets the remaining delta suf=\r\nfering?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;My Response: Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a f=\r\nunction of\nthat karma alone. It is a function of that karma and one&#39;s curre=\r\nnt state\nof mind. If someone serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stom=\r\nach\nfor half day or diaria for a week. It depends on how strong one is.\nSim=\r\nilarly, the same karmaphala set in motion by the same external agents\nof de=\r\nlivery (physical & subtle) can cause different reaction inside one,\ndependi=\r\nng on one&#39;s current state of mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An idle mind is devil&#39;s work=\r\nshop. Our minds keep vibrating with\nvarious notions and thoughts. A mind vi=\r\nbrating with selfish desires and\nunnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* =\r\nthe negative effects of one&#39;s\nenvironment (through which fruits of karmas a=\r\nre\n&gt; administered).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one thinks of ishta devata with reverenc=\r\ne and contemplates\nvarious ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vi=\r\nbrates with\nsaattwik energy, it absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s envir=\r\nonment\nbetter or at least does not amplify them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;___________=\r\n_____________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

Purusha is the\nwitness of it all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Though eac=\r\nh karma should give karmaphala that is commensurate with\nit, that requires =\r\nan *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another\nbeing. So this requires =\r\na complicated balancing act on part of Cosmic\nCumulative Kinetic Consciousn=\r\ness (i.e. Shakti). There are very\ncomplicated rules that decide the *sequen=\r\ncing* of karmaphalas and\npicking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must\nexp=\r\nerience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably\nexperie=\r\nnce karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool\nwhich may =\r\nnot be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned\nand ordered in=\r\n these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala\nsequencing of al=\r\nl beings.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The assignment and ordering of these pools will con=\r\nstantly undergo\nchurn as one engages in various new actions and adds them t=\r\no the pools.\nAlso, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms o=\r\nf\nkarmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and hence the pools\n=\r\nmay be re-arranged.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As one engages in remedial measures su=\r\nch as prayers, fasting,\ndonations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, chan=\r\nge one&#39;s\nvulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings\n(in=\r\ncluding planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery\nof karm=\r\naphala, who operate through other people who act as physical\nagents of deli=\r\nvery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result.\nSome undesirable ka=\r\nrmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down\nin order within the s=\r\name pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded\nto a higher pool or pus=\r\nhed up in order within the same pool.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2 When someone curses or bless=\r\nes one, with sufficient mental\nforce behind it (this is the key), the same =\r\nthing can happen. It is all\nabout re-arranging karmas between the karmik po=\r\nols. Every action by one,\nor even people around one, has the potential to r=\r\ne-arrange one&#39;s karmik\npools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postp=\r\noned or a karma that\nwas not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advance=\r\nd sooner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;However, remember that the remedial measure has to =\r\nbe as intense as\nthe karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a =\r\nsmall rock\nwith small force, but you need a large force to move a big rock =\r\nor a\nhill.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool =\r\nthat can give a\nspecific result, nobody can make one experience that result=\r\n, no matter\nwhat ritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of n=\r\negative\nkarmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of\npo=\r\nsitive karmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies,\ncurses a=\r\nnd blessings can often make some difference.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This point is we=\r\nll illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story\nDigamber ji referred in his poi=\r\nnt (3).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of on=\r\ne&#39;s actions, one\nis mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may sh=\r\now favoritism\ntowards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of=\r\n God is a\nwitness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God =\r\nis the\npower that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balance a=\r\nnd\norder within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in\nHe=\r\nr eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She\nadmin=\r\nisters just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using\navailable agen=\r\nts.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pi=\r\npeline and\nwill give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with=\r\n them,\nwith some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most\nimpo=\r\nrtant thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline\nnow. Simp=\r\nly put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to\nothers are b=\r\nad karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause\npleasure or benefit t=\r\no others are good karmas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;When it comes to manipulating the p=\r\nre-existing pipeline of karmas\nawaiting karmaphala, through conscious effor=\r\nt and current action, yes,\nit is possible and general guidelines are availa=\r\nble in shastras, but we\ncan&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each =\r\naction. One thing is\nfor sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has=\r\n to be\ncommensurate with the karma\n&gt; itself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You need only sm=\r\nall force to push a cat out of your way, but need a\nlarge force to push an =\r\nelephant.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From:=\r\n Ajit Krishnan ajit.krishnan@...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] few questions\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear=C2 Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was\nappoin=\r\nted by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king.
