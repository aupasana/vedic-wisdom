Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop=\r\n is very difficult to look at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gon=\r\ne by few weeks ago.\n=A0\nMany years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a s=\r\nadhu came one late evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a qu=\r\nite corner and told me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had =\r\na glow on his face and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later o=\r\nn he also gave me a Mantra of=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu =\r\nleft in the morning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told m=\r\ne did not happen and this tithi became very upsetting for me.\n=A0\nSome year=\r\ns back here in London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a crowde=\r\nd bus and holding on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tithi of =\r\nBhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra&#92;name and try to m=\r\neditate on Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strangeness=\r\n of that situation. After few more minutes I reached home and opened my fro=\r\nnt door and went inside. After going through my Puja room and telling my mo=\r\nther that I was back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very near to=\r\n front gate. Then I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept for ne=\r\narly one hour. After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front door =\r\nalthough nobody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was covere=\r\nd in Police lines and tapes. I could not believe it. \n=A0\nI asked a policem=\r\nan who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at ea=\r\nch other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was c=\r\nlearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky several=\r\n minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although there was n=\r\no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a single=\r\n thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and whole n=\r\noises and drama.\nWhat else is this but Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri=A0Chi=\r\nnnmastaji\n=A0\nGoodLuck=A0 and Thanks\nLaxmiNarayan\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\nr=\r\nom: Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Saturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48\nSubject: Re: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamast=\r\ne \n\n\nAparna ji, afew of us whom you consider are blessed with the desire to=\r\n pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail. The ways of god are ve=\r\nry mysterious and we humans especially in this yug have no right to ask her=\r\n ruling. Calling god &quot;damn&quot; hurts especially for those who pray her like pa=\r\nrents. If you don&#39;t like god please keep your feelings towards yourself as =\r\nthis forum is not meant for those who hate god.The=A0 mail that nobody ji h=\r\nas written is for those who already pray him not for newcomers who have to =\r\nyet develop love/affection/trust for god...=A0=A0\n\nAs I write this I show n=\r\no hatred towards you or those people who talk in similar fashion. It is the=\r\nir ignorance and the soul transformation doesn&#39;t happen easily. Hence I wil=\r\nl definitely pray for your inner growth. \n\n\nNobody ji has spoken thousand w=\r\nords of wisdom hats off to his thoughts.=A0 When I went to learn car drivin=\r\ng the teacher saw me driving with no attention. He yelled at me and I learn=\r\nt driving in one day. Some students don&#39;t listen when explained gently, som=\r\ne students listen only when the teacher yells so no offences should be take=\r\nn by anyone.=A0 \n\n\nAnother thing I always noticed is that for some reason m=\r\nost of them in this forum talk with great respect to Narsimha ji and don&#39;t =\r\neven consider taking advices given by any other devotees. We all know Narsi=\r\nmha ji but we don&#39;t know which other high raised souls we are talking to. P=\r\nlease talk with respect and consideration towards other devotees also other=\r\nwise our prayers are a complete waste....\n\nRegards,\nPriyaShaantih Shaantih =\r\nShaantih ||\n\n\n \n\n\nYour email settings: Individual Email|Traditional \nChange=\r\n settings via the Web (Yahoo!
