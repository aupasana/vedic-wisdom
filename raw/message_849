Last week I had been on a trip to Kasi. It \nturned ou=\r\nt to be a terrific trip for me. That city has a strange \nspiritual atmosphe=\r\nre unlike any other place I have been to. Just in \ncase someone is planning=\r\n on a trip to Kasi any time in the future, \ndo not miss out of the followin=\r\ng places/temples apart from the \nregular temples. The following are lesser =\r\nknow but really powerful \nplaces of worship which I came across during my t=\r\nrip last week:\n\n1) Chausat Yogini temple in the Chausat ghat. The temple ha=\r\ns one \nidol for the 64 Yoginis and an idol of Ma Kali. \n\n2) Temple of Lord =\r\nShiva as Kedareshwar in Kedar Ghat. An amazing \ntemple. \n\n3) Sankata Temple=\r\n near Schindhia Ghat. \n\n4) Bindu Madhav temple \n\n5) The temple of Gopal whe=\r\nre Anandamayi Ma used to worship. \n\n6) Kinnaram Baba&#39;s Ashram. There is a d=\r\nhuni in the ashram which was \nlit by Kinnaram Baba himself from a funeral p=\r\nyre and has been \nburning continuously since then. The deity in Agni Rudra.=\r\n Regularly \nwood from the mahasamshan is inserted in the dhuni. Ordinary pe=\r\nople \nare not allowed to give any ahutis in that fire but one can sit \nclos=\r\ne to it and meditate. I felt that ashram to be one of the most \npowerful pl=\r\naces I had ever been to. \n\nJust thought of sharing the names of these place=\r\ns I came across \nduring my visit this time. \n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
