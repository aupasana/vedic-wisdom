But part of the candlestand that supports the candle may have a shadow on=\r\n it and be in the dark, despite supporting a candle giving light to many.\n =\r\n\nIf Ramakrishna was like a candle, sishyas such as Vivekananda, Brahmananda=\r\n, Shivananda etc were like mirrors on the wall. Hriday was like the candles=\r\ntand.\n \nYes, the candle has enough light to give to *anyone*, but the stand=\r\n is not in a good position to receive much light.\n \nIn any case, I do not t=\r\nhink you have to pity Hriday that much. Why do you conclude that Hriday was=\r\n not &quot;finally saved&quot; like Hazra? Yes, he was troubled by material problems =\r\ntill the end and they prevented him from rising above them. However, you ca=\r\nn look at it as praayaschitta forced on him in the same life for some of hi=\r\ns sins. Please note that nobody knows where and how he died and what he exp=\r\nerienced at the end!!\n \nHriday was a strong and energetic man who feared go=\r\nd and wanted self-realization. He served and protected Ramakrishna during v=\r\nery important phases of his life, especially when he was engaged in very in=\r\ntense sadhana for god-realization. The role played by Hriday in the entire =\r\nlila of Ramakrishna is very significant and enables everything else.\n \nHowe=\r\nver, a few serious bad karmas was incurred by him. He exploited Ramakrishna=\r\n for material benefits. He was the one who fought with Bhairavi Brahmani, w=\r\nho was Ramakrishna&#39;s tantra guru (gurvi), which eventually resulted in her =\r\nleave the place. He abused Sarada Mata also. As Ramakrishna&#39;s popularity an=\r\nd following increased, a strongman with a propensity to exploit the followi=\r\nng materially had to be sent away. That is why the divine Mother forced Hri=\r\nday into an unfortunate situation resulting in his being evicted from the t=\r\nemple.\n \nThe material suffering for the rest of his life may have been puni=\r\nshment in the same life for trying to materially exploit Ramakrishna&#39;s earl=\r\ny popularity.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPratap Chandra Hazra was much moe dif=\r\nferent and lacked many virtues of Hriday. He was a good scholar, but was eg=\r\noistic, untruthful, selfish, jealous, shrewd, calculating, manipulative and=\r\n hypocritical. This man with half-baked and dry scriptural knowledge fancie=\r\nd himself as a spiritually elevated soul and tried to preach even to Ramakr=\r\nishna. Interestingly, young Narendra was attracted to him and even tried to=\r\n convince Ramakrishna about Hazra. Must be some karmik connection from befo=\r\nre.\n \nIf Hazra received Ramakrishna&#39;s grace and had a blessed end, do you r=\r\neally believe that the man who served Ramakrishna tirelessly for many many =\r\ncrucial years would have been left to his fate at the end? He had to be lef=\r\nt to his fate for many years in his old age, to realize the futility of pur=\r\nsuing material things. But, he too could have received Ramakrishna&#39;s grace =\r\nat the end.\n \nActually, he had some nice experiences during the time he liv=\r\ned with Ramakrishna. But his mental conditioning did not allow it to be per=\r\nmanent. The suffering for the rest of life may have been necessary to wipe =\r\nthat conditioning and prepare him for a higher realization.\n \n*        *   =\r\n     *\n \nEach person plays a role in the divine drama of a saint. There is =\r\nno need to pity anyone. Based on the spiritual readiness and mental conditi=\r\noning of each person, each person plays a different role. In the end, all m=\r\nake spiritual progress due to their association with the saint.\n \nLet us wo=\r\nrry about our own progress, instead of worrying about Hriday and Hazra.\n \nB=\r\nest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpir=\r\nituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------- \n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pat=\r\nhak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 15,=\r\n 2009 2:31 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] &quot;They lived with God&quot; and Sad story o=\r\nf Hridaynath Mukherjee\n \n\n&gt; Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; for almost 5 years now, i =\r\nam at loss to understand few things which i put forth to you and other memb=\r\ners.\n&gt; since i&#39;ve read Gospel and leela prasanga of Thakur, i was feeling s=\r\nad about Hazara Mahashaya and Hridaynath (Hridu). it was and still is, unso=\r\nlved painful mystry for me. i purchased &quot;They lived with God&quot; a couple of d=\r\nays back and at least i am satisfied with the situation of Hazara mahashaya=\r\n at his death and i am now happy for him and there is no more surprise for =\r\nhim but when i came to know later life account of Hridaynath in good detail=\r\ns, the painful feeling has grown more and so the surprise, for his misfotun=\r\ne even serving Thakur Ramakrishna for 25 years or so.\n&gt; \n&gt; How can a person=\r\n, who was chosen to serve such a Master during his sadhanaa days  have such=\r\n an end?

(talking of spiritual \nperspective here).&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; it is not at all convincing to think that he \ndeveloped pride, became =\r\nharsh and haughty, started controlling Ramakrishna, \nstarted taking money f=\r\nrom visitors, started scolding Thakur etc...and that is \nwhy he suffered. T=\r\nhakur, who spiritually transformed many lives, could have \neasily transform=\r\ned Hridu. why he didn&#39;t do that? why the poor Hridu got trapped \nin Shadrip=\r\nu so badly even staying so close to Thakur? Even Hazara Mahashaya was \nfina=\r\nlly saved. where is the compassion of thakur when we see Hridaynath&#39;s later=\r\n \nlife?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; any thoughts?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nYours,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_02E2_01CA0670.994FAD40--\r\n\n"}}
