You can find Aayu=\r\nshya sooktam in the following PDF file that I just uploaded:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/mantras/aayushya_sooktam.pdf\n&gt;  \n&gt; People perform homam =\r\nwith it by simply invoking fire, doing poorvaangam and then directly offeri=\r\nng this sooktam in fire, and then uttaraangam. In other words, praana prati=\r\nshthaa of the deity, panchopachaara pooja to the deity ets are not done. Yo=\r\nu can follow such a procedure.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For it to be more effective, finish th=\r\ne 9 verses with 9 aahutis and then repeat the nine again. Repeat as many ti=\r\nmes as you can.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Normally, only ghee is used for this homam.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All=\r\n the best.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;satyanandaswami@&quot; &lt;satyanandaswami@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha=\r\n PVR Rao!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please accept my humble reverences.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was not a=\r\nble to contact you in any other way.\n&gt; &gt; I am  very happy to join\n&gt; &gt; this =\r\nwonderful group.First i want to thank you from the depth of my heart for yo=\r\nu noble efforts with providing all the materials related to Homam and wonde=\r\nrful recordings of the Vedic Mantras.
