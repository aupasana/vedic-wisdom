T=\r\nhe atman is entirely opposed to action\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, note one fact. Lo=\r\nng after becoming a sannyasin, Swami \n&gt; Sivananda travelled the world, wrot=\r\ne books, gave lectures and founded \n&gt; Divine Life Society, among other &quot;act=\r\nions&quot;! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If he established DLS with the exp=\r\nectation that it becomes a success or \n&gt; 10,000 people join it or some such=\r\n thing, then it would become an \n&gt; ignorant action, i.e. action with attach=\r\nment. If he did the action \n&gt; completely ready for any outcome and without =\r\na sense of ownership, and \n&gt; as an instrument of the divine will, then it i=\r\ns neither &quot;worldly&quot; nor \n&gt; binding nor ignorant. The problem is not &quot;action=\r\ns&quot;, but actions with \n&gt; attachment and a sense of ownership, i.e. actions d=\r\nriven by the will and \n&gt; agenda of a limited ego.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actions should not b=\r\ne spoken ill of like this. Detached action is a \n&gt; *sacred duty* of every b=\r\neing. Gods and rishis came back again and again \n&gt; to earth to engage in de=\r\ntached action.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If &quot;the atman is entirely oppo=\r\nsed to action&quot;, then why is atman (Self) \n&gt; even allowing action? Why doesn=\r\n&#39;t it simply halt everything? Or, is all \n&gt; the action happening outside of=\r\n atman? Is there anything outside of \n&gt; atman at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some buddhist ph=\r\nilosophies coined the term anatman (non-Self) to \n&gt; describe transient thin=\r\ngs. But, in Vedic philosophy, there is no \n&gt; anatman. All that is is atman =\r\n(Self). Ocean is permanent and still, but \n&gt; ripples that arise in it are t=\r\nransient and moving. But ripples are part \n&gt; of ocean only and you do not s=\r\ntart labeling ripples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman or Purusha or Shiva is the=\r\n potential energy of this cosmos, while \n&gt; Maya or Prakriti or Shakti is th=\r\ne kinetic energy of this cosmos. Shiva \n&gt; and Shakti are seen as different =\r\nentities by some people, but rishis \n&gt; have declared their oneness. Potenti=\r\nal energy becomes kinetic energy and \n&gt; vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman is the still=\r\n ocean and Maya is the force (kinetic) that gives rise \n&gt; to moving ripples=\r\n on the surface. A ripple that exerts itself to move in \n&gt; a particular way=\r\n keeps colliding with the force and keeps moving hither \n&gt; and tither in a =\r\nchaotic way for a very long time. A ripple that does not \n&gt; exert itself an=\r\nd moves smoothly as dictated by the force will eventually \n&gt; grind to a hal=\r\nt and cease to exist as a ripple on the surface. It then \n&gt; becomes part of=\r\n the still ocean. If a ripple exerts itself to become \n&gt; still, it may even=\r\n take longer to become still. What prolongs a ripple \n&gt; is not movement but=\r\n resisting the direction given by the force and \n&gt; exerting to move in a pa=\r\nrticular way (or even exerting to become still). \n&gt; A ripple that surrender=\r\ns to the force will ride the course and die down \n&gt; faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Contemplat=\r\ne the imagery I presented above regarding Atman and Maya, \n&gt; ignorant/egois=\r\ntic action and detached action! It is very apt.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In not-so-distant past, sannyasins remained in ashrams and isolated \n&gt; t=\r\nhemselves from society and did their sadhana. Swami Vivekananda started \n&gt; =\r\na new trend.\n&gt; \n&gt; A sannyasin renounces expectation of things from people s=\r\ntuck in \n&gt; transient material world and does not depend on anyone. But he m=\r\nay still \n&gt; *give* basic material things to those hapless people stuck in t=\r\nransient \n&gt; material world! For example, Swami Vivekananda and his brother =\r\nmonks \n&gt; went to places struck by plague, floods, droughts, cyclones etc an=\r\nd \n&gt; served people. They provided food, medicines etc (instead of lecturing=\r\n \n&gt; that body is a transient illusion and one should stop worrying about it=\r\ns \n&gt; welfare!) and also did construction work. They ignored the welfare of =\r\n\n&gt; their own bodies, put themselves at risk and overcame maya personally. \n=\r\n&gt; But they served those still stuck in maya without looking down upon them =\r\n\n&gt; or their needs or maya that trapped them! Those who wanted food got \n&gt; f=\r\nood, those who wanted medicines got medicines and those who wanted \n&gt; books=\r\n got books. Renunciation means you do not expect anything from \n&gt; anyone an=\r\nd accept whatever comes to you naturally. It does not \n&gt; necessarily mean r=\r\nejecting or ignoring others. Overcoming maya does not \n&gt; require belittling=\r\n maya or belittling those still stuck in maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trend started by Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda was continued by Swami Sivananda. \n&gt; For that reason, it is=\r\n a bit weird to see him talking so ill of action! \n&gt; He was obviously tryin=\r\ng to inspire a specific group of people for a \n&gt; specific body of work. The=\r\nse words are neither universal nor do they \n&gt; reflect his tremendous wisdom=\r\n I have seen elsewhere!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; All this intellectual=\r\n discussion may be satisfying to some, but the \n&gt; quote from Swami Brahmana=\r\nnanda in the other mail is very apt: &quot;You have \n&gt; been only hearing of all =\r\nthese spiritual things. Now realise them. You \n&gt; have done enough study and=\r\n reasoning. Now do some spiritual practice. \n&gt; First take up that aspect of=\r\n God which appeals to you most. Follow your \n&gt; own path of Sadhana. When yo=\r\nu realise God through it, you will feel the \n&gt; joy of realising Him also in=\r\n other aspects and through other paths.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; According to Ramakrishna, Swa=\r\nmi Brahmananda was a gopala who accompanied \n&gt; Lord Krishna in a previous l=\r\nife. His words are simple, pragmatic and \n&gt; powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want this foru=\r\nm to facilitate exchange of Vedic knowledge (and I will \n&gt; also be contribu=\r\nting, though in spurts). But I want more that this forum \n&gt; should inspire =\r\npeople to do sadhana and find God.

The atman is entirely opposed to action&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Fi=\r\nrst of all, note one fact. Long after becoming a sannyasin, Swami &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Sivananda travelled the world, wrote books, gave lectures and founded &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Divine Life Society, among other &quot;actions&quot;! :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If he established DLS with the expecta=\r\ntion that it becomes a success or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 10,000 people join it or some s=\r\nuch thing, then it would become an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ignorant action, i.e. action w=\r\nith attachment. If he did the action &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; completely ready for any out=\r\ncome and without a sense of ownership, and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as an instrument of th=\r\ne divine will, then it is neither &quot;worldly&quot; nor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; binding nor ignor=\r\nant. The problem is not &quot;actions&quot;, but actions with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; attachment an=\r\nd a sense of ownership, i.e. actions driven by the will and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; agend=\r\na of a limited ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Actions should not be spoken ill of =\r\nlike this. Detached action is a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *sacred duty* of every being. God=\r\ns and rishis came back again and again &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to earth to engage in deta=\r\nched action.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If &quot;=\r\nthe atman is entirely opposed to action&quot;, then why is atman (Self) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; even allowing action? Why doesn&#39;t it simply halt everything? Or, is all &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; the action happening outside of atman? Is there anything outside o=\r\nf &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; atman at all?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Some buddhist philosophies coi=\r\nned the term anatman (non-Self) to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; describe transient things. But=\r\n, in Vedic philosophy, there is no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; anatman. All that is is atman =\r\n(Self). Ocean is permanent and still, but &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ripples that arise in i=\r\nt are transient and moving. But ripples are part &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of ocean only an=\r\nd you do not start labeling ripples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Atma=\r\nn or Purusha or Shiva is the potential energy of this cosmos, while &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Maya or Prakriti or Shakti is the kinetic energy of this cosmos. Shiva &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; and Shakti are seen as different entities by some people, but rish=\r\nis &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have declared their oneness. Potential energy becomes kinetic =\r\nenergy and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vice versa.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Atman is the still ocea=\r\nn and Maya is the force (kinetic) that gives rise &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to moving rippl=\r\nes on the surface. A ripple that exerts itself to move in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a parti=\r\ncular way keeps colliding with the force and keeps moving hither &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nand tither in a chaotic way for a very long time. A ripple that does not &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; exert itself and moves smoothly as dictated by the force will event=\r\nually &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; grind to a halt and cease to exist as a ripple on the surfa=\r\nce. It then &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; becomes part of the still ocean. If a ripple exerts i=\r\ntself to become &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; still, it may even take longer to become still. W=\r\nhat prolongs a ripple &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is not movement but resisting the direction=\r\n given by the force and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exerting to move in a particular way (or =\r\neven exerting to become still). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A ripple that surrenders to the f=\r\norce will ride the course and die down &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; faster.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Contemplate the imagery I presented above regarding Atman and Maya, &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; ignorant/egoistic action and detached action! It is very apt.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In not-so-distant past, sa=\r\nnnyasins remained in ashrams and isolated &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; themselves from society=\r\n and did their sadhana. Swami Vivekananda started &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a new trend.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A sannyasin renounces expectation of things from people st=\r\nuck in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; transient material world and does not depend on anyone. Bu=\r\nt he may still &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *give* basic material things to those hapless peop=\r\nle stuck in transient &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; material world! For example, Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda and his brother monks &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; went to places struck by plague, floods=\r\n, droughts, cyclones etc and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; served people. They provided food, m=\r\nedicines etc (instead of lecturing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that body is a transient illus=\r\nion and one should stop worrying about its &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; welfare!) and also did=\r\n construction work. They ignored the welfare of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; their own bodies,=\r\n put themselves at risk and overcame maya personally. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But they se=\r\nrved those still stuck in maya without looking down upon them &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; or =\r\ntheir needs or maya that trapped them! Those who wanted food got &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nfood, those who wanted medicines got medicines and those who wanted &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; books got books. Renunciation means you do not expect anything from &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; anyone and accept whatever comes to you naturally. It does not &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; necessarily mean rejecting or ignoring others. Overcoming maya does not=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; require belittling maya or belittling those still stuck in maya.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The trend started by Swami Vivekananda was continued by=\r\n Swami Sivananda. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For that reason, it is a bit weird to see him t=\r\nalking so ill of action! &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He was obviously trying to inspire a spe=\r\ncific group of people for a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; specific body of work. These words ar=\r\ne neither universal nor do they &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reflect his tremendous wisdom I h=\r\nave seen elsewhere!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; All this intellectual discussion may be satisfying to some, but the &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; quote from Swami Brahmanananda in the other mail is very apt: &quot;You ha=\r\nve &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; been only hearing of all these spiritual things. Now realise t=\r\nhem. You &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have done enough study and reasoning. Now do some spirit=\r\nual practice. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; First take up that aspect of God which appeals to y=\r\nou most. Follow your &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; own path of Sadhana. When you realise God th=\r\nrough it, you will feel the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; joy of realising Him also in other as=\r\npects and through other paths.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; According to Ramakrishna=\r\n, Swami Brahmananda was a gopala who accompanied &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Krishna in =\r\na previous life. His words are simple, pragmatic and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; powerful.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I want this forum to facilitate exchange of Vedic knowledg=\r\ne (and I will &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; also be contributing, though in spurts). But I want=\r\n more that this forum &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should inspire people to do sadhana and fin=\r\nd God. In the end, that is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what matters.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;                    &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFil=\r\nms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;       Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;                 =\r\n      Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Jun 20, 2011 at 2:31 PM, Kr=\r\nishnendu wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      Some may say: =C3=A2From. this it f=\r\nollows that it is not necessary for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a knower even to serve his pr=\r\neceptor or to perform tapas.=C3=A2 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Householders who are afraid of=\r\n begging for bread and are afraid of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ridicule argue like this thr=\r\nough their sharp intelligence.
