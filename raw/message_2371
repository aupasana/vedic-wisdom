Knowledge consisting of mere factual statements is dry and sometimes difficult to digest. Story telling style of expressing knowledge personalizes it and adds the right spices that promote its digestion. Though it makes knowledge easier to relate to, understand and digest, the drawback is that it takes the background and intellectual ability of an intended audience into account and a different kind of audience may misunderstand some details.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;  \n&gt; Actually just to clarify, there is quiet a bit of controversy about the Puri temple. During the days of Swamji, the western scholars unequivocally stated that Puri was build on a Buddhist temple, however today, there is contrary evidences which says that it was not a temple built by destroying or converting another temple. Infact, there are some very old manuscripts that pass on through generations of the main priests of the Temple, which also shed some light on this fact. It is from one of that manuscripts it was found that the Temple was orginally built as a Bhairava Temple with the pradhan deities being Mahakali, Tara and Bhuvaneshwari. The whole area of the temple was designed as a Bhairavi Chakra, that is why the prasad of Puri is called Mahaprasad - beyond all rules (even one who is fasting can have the prasad of Puri).\n&gt;  \n&gt; To clarify, my mail was not at all a criticism of the man that Swamiji was. Without the slightest iota of doubt, he single handedly achieved what it would have taken a crowd of average calibre men thousands of years. He was a leader of men. And about his spiritual calibre, there is no question either. Thakur had himself certified Swamji, and Thakur&#39;s words on spirituality are like Gospel truths for me.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, when it comes to judging/understanding material aspects of knowledge, it is always a changing reality, therefore best is to keep oneself updated. Respect the past, learn from the past and then use ones own reasoning to modify it for the present in the light of new evidences, if needed. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Same thing I find with Aghora books. Brilliant as they are, in places Vimalananda uses hyperboles or approximations to build his story, an intelligent reader will have to discern. That does not mean Vimalananda was incorrect, not at all, he is essentially correct in all things, but the specifics he would supplement as per teh need of the person he was speaking too. The problem with western style academics is that they are fixated with factual accuracy and do not understand the use of myth/hyperbole/story-telling as a way of passing knowledge (which is so essential in the Indian context). That is why they take every word as either true or false based on strict objective paramters and thus end up making ridiculous theories. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I hope I have clarified my stand.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 28/8/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

Do \n&gt; not accept something unless you understand and *digest* it. Accumulating a \n&gt; lot of undigested knowledge causes problems later, just as accumulating a \n&gt; lot of undigested food in one&#39;s stomach does.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time, be mindful of the fact that a spiritual giant&#39;s view may \n&gt; be unpalatable to you because of your own limitations, i.e. you may be \n&gt; missing something. Give the benefit of doubt and try to understand \n&gt; respectfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, when it comes to factual inaccuracies, it is a different matter. \n&gt; If you know for sure that something a spiritual giant said was a factual \n&gt; inaccuracy, you can of course dismiss and ignore it.\n&gt; \n&gt; An active man like Vivekananda, who accomplished so much in a life of 39 \n&gt; years, may sometimes use wrong facts at his disposal based on the \n&gt; understanding at his time, to advocate what he wanted to advocate. But, \n&gt; blessed jnaanis and karma yogis like Vivekananda or Aurobindo would often \n&gt; end up advocating correct views even if they use wrong facts occasionally to \n&gt; support their views.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I am not mistakened, the current temple at Puri was built around 1000 AD \n&gt; or so. I am not sure of what existed in that specific place before.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 26, 2009 7:58 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Swami Vivekananda says women must grow in the \n&gt; footprints of Sita\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Amit and Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I remember having read the book called &quot;Bharatiya Nari&quot; (Translated \n&gt; &gt; version of Vivekananda&#39; s work on Indian women&quot;.

You&#39;ve raised something that has\n&gt; &gt;&gt; made me stop to think many times. It seems to me that Swami Vivekananda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; made many statements - especially about Hinduism and India - that could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be construed to be disparaging of other religions and cultures, and that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to me at least seemed a little unwarranted.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether this can be put down simply to naivete, or whether it served\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some purpose which we do not see, and is now taken out of context, I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; don&#39;t know. In either case I have yet to reconcile those statements with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the rest of his teachings.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Samir\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 25/08/2009 11:46, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; /To any man who knows anything about Indian history, that very \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; statement\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; proves that the whole thing was a fraud, because the temple of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jagannath\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is an old Buddhistic temple. We took this and others over and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; re-Hinduised them. /\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; //\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; With all due respect to the great man that Swamiji was, he was possibly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not aware what kind of effects an ill-researched statement may have in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; future.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That statement above is very controvertial and possibly incorrect. But\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the fact that it comes from Vivekananda, often people may consider it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be sacroscant and land up with wrong conclusions. Without a doubt,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Swamiji was a spiritual Giant, but he was not a historian. He naively\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; accepted most of the ideas about Indian history as propagated by \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; western\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholars.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Therefore, my advise, read lots and form your /own /opinions.
