However, it just appears =\r\njoyless. The idea of Sadhana is to make is joyful beyond anything that we h=\r\nave ever enjoyed. That is what makes it difficult.\n\nThat is my personal exp=\r\nerience too. Many a times, I start Sadhana for any reason that comes out of=\r\n my grief, sorrow, fear, anger etc. Initially I find it helping and cosolin=\r\ng till I am out of this negative emotions. Slowly then I see that my emotio=\r\nns move towards feeling overproud about doing Sadhana and then losing inter=\r\nest and hence feeling bored or forced by my pride to do it. But that is not=\r\n what Sadhana is. Many Sant have said that, the mahima of Mantra or Naam is=\r\n such that, one feels doing it again and again. That is where I see my fail=\r\nure as Sadhak. I have never experienced it this way. They say that you need=\r\n Gurukripa for that.\n\nDoing it without joy is like Hath Yoga. It will still=\r\n give the result gradually but definitely.\n\nNamaskar,\n\nJagmohan\n\n\n\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vini takuma@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your illuminating mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The importance of Mant=\r\nra is in Sadhana&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Have to keep reminding myself of this...even thoug=\r\nh the path ahead seems so difficult and joyless at times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jagmohan Nanaware&quot; &lt;jagmohan_=\r\nnanaware@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ganapati is &#39;ee&#39;karant pulling =\r\n(masculine) word in Sanskrit.\n&gt; &gt; Devi is ee&#39;karant stiling (feminine) word=\r\n in Sanskrit.\n&gt; &gt; Shiv is &#39;a&#39;karant pulling (masculine) word in Sanskrit.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Visnhu is &#39;u&#39;karant pulling (masculine) word in Sanskrit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For a=\r\nny action, in sanskrit, the object to which it is meant for you have to use=\r\n chaturthi ekvachan (singular) vibhakti. \n&gt; &gt; For &#39;ee&#39;karant masculine, it =\r\nis &#39;ye&#39; Hence, Ganapataye\n&gt; &gt; For &#39;ee&#39;karant feminine, it is &#39;vyei&#39; Hence, =\r\nDevyei\n&gt; &gt; For &#39;a&#39;karant masculine, it is &#39;aay&#39; Hence, Shivaay\n&gt; &gt; For &#39;u&#39;k=\r\narant masculine, it is &#39;ve&#39; Hence Vishnave\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the Sanskrit sentenc=\r\ne is Ganapataye Nama:, Devyei Nama:, Shivaay Nama:, Vishnave Nama:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n When it becomes a mantra,\n&gt; &gt; 1.

In additio=\r\nn it can have a &#39;bijakshar&#39; such as G^n. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hence the mantra is \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 1. &quot;Om G^n Ganapataye Nama:&quot;\n&gt; &gt; 2. &quot;Om Nama: Shivaay&quot; (Bijakshar is not n=\r\needed.

Every Mantra needs to be m=\r\nade Siddha. There are methods for doing this. The examples are well known. =\r\nStory says that, Devarshi Narad gave mantra to Valya Koli - &quot;Mara&quot; and aske=\r\nd him to repeat it continuously. You know the rest of the story.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe simple method to make a mantra siddha is to repeat it daily for a commit=\r\nted number of times with full dedication to the meaning of each syllable of=\r\n the mantra. The effect is seen gradually but definitely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am sor=\r\nry, I always found it difficult to set the pronounciations right for a non =\r\nIndian language speaking person. Sometimes even it is difficult to explain =\r\nit to an Indian language speaking person. For example - In &quot;Shivaay Nama:&quot; =\r\nand &quot;Nama: Shivaay&quot;, there is a subtle difference in the pronounciation of =\r\n&quot;Nama:&quot;. In the first one &quot;ha&quot; of the visarga &quot;:&quot; is to be pronounced compl=\r\netely while in the second one it is to be pronounced like a swar &quot;:&quot; (no &quot;h=\r\na&quot;).
