I have seen the diamo=\r\nnd example, but not the other inputs before.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unlike the diamond exampl=\r\ne, here is another facet I learnt. Lord Krsna has 64 qualities while Lord N=\r\narayana has 60 qualities only. Brahman is the effulgence of LordKrsna and t=\r\nhe ones who follow advaita get into a situation of no birth, no death and m=\r\nerge in the brahma jyothi. This is under the rulership of Lord SadaShiva (t=\r\nhe supreme to all Sivas). The devotees of Lord Krsna (let us take it as dva=\r\nita) can have an eternal relationship with Lord serving them (Lord is never=\r\n alone, his hladini shakti as Radharani is always with him) either as a cow=\r\n or lotus plant or kadamba tree. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even in the example you have given, =\r\nthe facets of diamond are fine. But why do we need to attribute one facet&#39;s=\r\n relation with the other. So, either the relations are just an allegory or =\r\nthey are real. If they are real, then the relations have to respected as is=\r\n. It also can mean, the supreme who has expanded himself or created the res=\r\nt of the facets. If it is the latter, there is only one supreme and the nex=\r\nt question is, who is that original ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, I am just thinking loud=\r\n as the stories / allegories look good to some extent, beyond which it is t=\r\nough to imagine some scenarios. Unless it has been corrupted, Sanathana Dha=\r\nrma has made understanding the Lord very difficult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, I liked Sh=\r\n Manish&#39;s response to one of my concerns on one of these kind of questions =\r\n- &quot;See, don&#39;t care what anyone says; Just do Sadhana like crazy, ok !&quot; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is partly addressed =\r\nin the diamond analogy in the very first \n&gt; &gt; message of this yahoogroup \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyoti=\r\nsh Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;       Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twitter=\r\n ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 3:34 AM, Rama V wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;     Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I beg to disagree and will leave it at that.

I am completing the last time on the Chaturdasi before th=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Navaratris begin. During Navaratris I plan to perform Chandi Homa=\r\nm \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with 700 verses. Currently I am doing Chandi Homam daily with onl=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Durga Sapta Sloki because I am doing chanting otherwise. Sapta Sa=\r\nti, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tough as it seemed in the beginning, became a lot more easier f=\r\nor me \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to chant now (that was the objective with which I have taken =\r\nup this \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I plan to memorize all th=\r\nat. On \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this occasion, I have a question for Shri Narasimha Garu. I =\r\nhave come \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; across a writing somewhere on Sapta Sati as to how it can=\r\n be a mantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sastra. The second verse &quot;SavarniH Soorya TanayOH ....=\r\n.&quot; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpreted to as &quot;Hreem..&quot; beejakshara mantra. Do we have a=\r\n book \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that explains all of the SaptaSati in several contexts, the l=\r\niteral \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; meaning, esoteric meaning, the several mantras that the vers=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; represent etc.? If there is no book like that, I would request S=\r\nhri \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; PVR to author such a book because of his deep insights into the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject/language and the advanced sadhaka that he is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Nagra=\r\nj\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
