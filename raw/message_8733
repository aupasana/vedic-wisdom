Yes direction must be always, always t=\r\nhe top most priority. It reminded me of simple, yet quite effective day to =\r\nday example of driving Car. One can not miss/ignore the sight of correct ro=\r\nad to the destination even for a split second. However, Optimised &quot;controll=\r\ned&quot; speed (even if very fast by set standards) could be an added advantage =\r\nwhile not loosing the sight of the road.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal  \n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Got an=\r\n sms from a good friend today. Thought I will share it here.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Progress=\r\n has little to do with speed; but much to do with direction. So always conc=\r\nentrate on your direction, not on speed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For any genuine spiritual se=\r\neker, this is one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spiritualit=\r\ny, too many people get caught up in the less important - aka, visions, &#39;exp=\r\neriences&#39;, tough-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while=\r\n forgetting the goal of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/e=\r\nmotions/body resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimi=\r\nty to life situations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lesseni=\r\nng of lower emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious=\r\n attachments, such that eventually every action of the individual is like a=\r\n consecration (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and =\r\nso away from our average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillme=\r\nnt on its own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the prog=\r\nressive unfolding of a transformation process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Complex rituals and spe=\r\nedy sadhanas and experiences et al are ok, provided one does not lose sight=\r\n of the fundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up runni=\r\nng in circles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a sp=\r\niritual entity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-way.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
