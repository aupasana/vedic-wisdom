They like pillars to me in=\r\n this\n&gt; matter. In fact i do have a Brahmin Iyer childhood friend who clear=\r\ns my\n&gt; doubt when it comes to Ganapathy Homam. He is the one who prepares a=\r\nll the\n&gt; dharbas for me, teaches me other important about Homam, teaches me=\r\n how to\n&gt; maintain the fire. Additioanlly, he is the one who suggest me to =\r\nput water\n&gt; Pot and bath with it every morning. All this happens because of=\r\n Lord\n&gt; Ganesha. In fact, my family, friends, and other are astonished of m=\r\ny\n&gt; actions. I took 6 months to learn all the manthars and actions of this\n=\r\n&gt; homam from the manual and the videos.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even though i fall easily tired=\r\n because im working and fasting but in the\n&gt; end it gives me a kind of plea=\r\nsure and self-satisfaction of the Homam\n&gt; completion.Its just sometimes the=\r\n intonation and the pronunciation compared\n&gt; to yours will be different. So=\r\nmetimes the coconut that i put for Poornahuti\n&gt; will not crack till end. So=\r\nmetimes i miss certain rituals. These are things\n&gt; actually makes me upset =\r\nbecause i want to do it perfectly. Whatever it is,\n&gt; my devotion to LORD GA=\r\nNESHA is divine.\n&gt;\n&gt; As im sending this email to you today it has been 21 d=\r\nays of performing\n&gt; the Ganesha Homam and 39 days to go on.
