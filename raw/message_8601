Especial=\r\nly the one\n&gt; which is modeled in the form of a bear, and claps its hands as=\r\n soon as\n&gt; it is powered on. Its hands hold two plates which strike each ot=\r\nher ,\n&gt; the bear&#39;s eyes light up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom=\r\n, we\n&gt; are ready to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There a=\r\nre other types also, like\n&gt; when you put batteries in a car model, it sudde=\r\nnly starts operating, and\n&gt; going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which sta=\r\nrts repeating some cuddly\n&gt; lines. It is loved by girls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Yes=\r\n, exactly. You, right now, are the teddy bear, which girls\n&gt; and everybody =\r\nloves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : =85=85=85=85. the fuck?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : aww!! How cute=\r\n , my little child is thinking in terms of\n&gt; profanities. Do you know why y=\r\nou are here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : *thinks in mind about all the philosophical stu=\r\nff he has read,\n&gt; and knew this question was widely discussed and asked, an=\r\nd thus becomes\n&gt; happy&quot;=85. why?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Because , somebody fucked s=\r\nomebody, LOL. But anyways, leave\n&gt; this fucking business aside for a moment=\r\n. Lets go back to the\n&gt; discussion, the end of which will be very fun.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Student: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Don&#39;t=\r\n twist my words, I said right now you are akin to a teddy\n&gt; bear. You have =\r\nbeen that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who\n&gt; claps, basically =\r\nall the battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical\n&gt; terms they are cal=\r\nled &quot;births&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : How may I ask?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : What is your nam=\r\ne?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humo=\r\nrous\n&gt; reasons)\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma\n=\r\n&gt; as the bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,\n&gt; th=\r\nat &quot;I am Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old\n&gt; , i=\r\n like this girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I\n&gt; hate =\r\nthat, I this, and I that&quot;, okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Go on.. * feeling a bit rid=\r\niculous about himself*\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going t=\r\no happen sooner than\n&gt; later, do you know what happens or what that means?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t die.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Very goo=\r\nd, you have read that off of a book, ever realized it?\n&gt; Are you not afraid=\r\n of death?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : No, I am not afraid of death.\n&gt; \n&gt; The lights tur=\r\nn off in the room, there is total darkness, for 5 minutes\n&gt; there is no noi=\r\nse, but Chaman gets terrified, and then a pair of deep\n&gt; red eyes appear in=\r\n the dark, and in the most ghastly voice ever asks Mr\n&gt; Chaman, &quot;why are yo=\r\nu so afraid? the basis of all fear is death, and only\n&gt; the lights have gon=\r\ne out, I haven&#39;t even started with you yet, if you\n&gt; say you are not going =\r\nto die, then why so scared?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Suddenly the lights turn back on, the tea=\r\ncher is laughing his ass off,\n&gt; with Chaman shivering.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : You s=\r\naid you were not afraid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I never meant it, like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\neacher : Then in what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that\n&gt; pract=\r\nical stuff in this spirituality business is far greater than all\n&gt; your boo=\r\nks combined. You get lost while reading, you think you are\n&gt; different. To =\r\nme you are no worse than the thousand others I meet,\n&gt; in-fact they are bet=\r\nter off without the texts you have studied.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Agreed, but don&#39;=\r\nt scare me like that. Again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : I will, if you make such ridicu=\r\nlous claims again. Anyways,\n&gt; where were we? The death of the teddy bear. Y=\r\nes. But mind you the teddy\n&gt; remains, the outer shell remains, but teddy is=\r\n dead. The outer shell is\n&gt; either buried or burnt, in essence done away wi=\r\nth, because it is of no\n&gt; use. Right?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Right\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : W=\r\nrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, when you\n&gt; remove the batter=\r\ny from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally\n&gt; useless, it can&#39;t clap=\r\n, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t do shit.\n&gt; Thus, at death, Mr Cham=\r\nan, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s body. You\n&gt; never die, you are only th=\r\ne battery powering this personality which\n&gt; leads to powering your body.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Student: How can you even=85=85\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Lets consider that you ar=\r\ne two batteries, two aa sized ones.\n&gt; When you plug the batteries into a ca=\r\nr, suddenly the car comes to life,\n&gt; without the battery the car is idle, b=\r\nut as soon as I put the battery\n&gt; in, the car goes=85=85.. beep beep honk h=\r\nonk, move, I am a car.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : sits in silence knowing well that int=\r\nerrupting now will be the\n&gt; biggest mistake ever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher :And when I =\r\ntake the same batteries out of a car and put it into\n&gt; lets say a teddy bea=\r\nr, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,\n&gt; or acts mushy. And w=\r\nhen I pull the battery out?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Teddy is idle, literally useless=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery that powered t=\r\nhe\n&gt; car, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bear, and it is th=\r\ne\n&gt; same battery that can power any toy, correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Correct\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Teacher : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself to be the\n=\r\n&gt; car. It believes &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm\n&gt; torqu=\r\ne, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my\n&gt; passe=\r\nngers seat, I am the king baby, look at how hot I am&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: Oh dear=\r\n god=85.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT =\r\nit is a\n&gt; useless piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, sudd=\r\nenly it\n&gt; believes itself to be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the=\r\n teddy,\n&gt; I am mushy, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am,=\r\n I can\n&gt; even clap my hands &quot;, and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the t=\r\neddy\n&gt; is=85..\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Useless, and dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Thats a use=\r\nless conclusion, it is known by the world, not\n&gt; realized. Every tom dick a=\r\nnd harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point\n&gt; is the battery confuses it=\r\nself to be the teddy or the god damn car.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So the battery is =\r\nthe soul?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* Who said that?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Student : You did.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : *another phatek on the head of the stude=\r\nnt* When did I say?\n&gt; You read it in one of your fancy articles and comment=\r\naries and satsangs\n&gt; that people do, genius, and you read it all too wrong,=\r\n you read it and\n&gt; thus think you &#39;know&#39;, you never practiced, fools you pe=\r\nople are. Most\n&gt; of the time you people are fed bullshit and you gobble it =\r\nup like pigs\n&gt; in mud. That reminds me we haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  pizza in=\r\n a long\n&gt; time, lets order one. LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Sorry=85\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : =\r\nDon&#39;t be, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our\n&gt; discussion =\r\non toys. The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you\n&gt; confuse yours=\r\nelf to be Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been\n&gt; plugged into a=\r\n a toy (read body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on\n&gt; the &quot;confusion&quot; a=\r\nspect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Then who am I?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : You are the ever lastin=\r\ng consciousness, the universal bliss,\n&gt; the infinite, the ever pervading li=\r\nght of the universe!!! Breathe in and\n&gt; out and feel the bliss!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Stude=\r\nnt : Yess!!! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*\n&gt; *Smells h=\r\nuge amounts of odor*=85=85 What is that smell?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : I just farted=\r\n, feels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Ewwwww=85.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent li=\r\nves\n&gt; in search of who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and o=\r\nut,\n&gt; and thinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???\n&gt;=\r\n Befkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : But you only said that  &quot;You are=\r\n the ever lasting\n&gt; consciousness, the universal bliss, the infinite, the e=\r\nver pervading\n&gt; light of the universe!!! Breathe in and out and feel the bl=\r\niss!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : It is called a test, and needless to say you have sco=\r\nred a\n&gt; compartment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Hey ram=85=85=85.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : So bac=\r\nk to who you are, you are just like the battery who is\n&gt; the source of that=\r\n body and the personality and confuses itself to be &quot;\n&gt; I am Chaman Sharma,=\r\n age 20, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,\n&gt; am a male, love to =\r\nparty, own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested\n&gt; in god and whatever=\r\n &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So who am I?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : You are duracell=85..How do t=\r\nhey write post a mathematics\n&gt; solution=85=85=85Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =\r\n=3D  quite easily done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Thats one more self identification o=\r\nf being duracell\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\ntudent: *Feels quite proud*\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : And THAT is one more self identi=\r\nfication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Hey Ram!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Ram Ram.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : S=\r\no I theoretically understand it , but how do I actually\n&gt; realize it?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nTeacher : You do Sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Sitting in a yogic pose and focusi=\r\nng on the lotus and all?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : I will fucking beat you to your dea=\r\nth if you repeat this\n&gt; bullshit ever again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: Sorry=85\n&gt; \n&gt; Te=\r\nacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhana to most\n&gt; people. B=\r\nut does anyone know what is Sadhana?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : You shed some light on =\r\nit?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana =\r\nis\n&gt; basically in essence, and mark these all important words.\n&gt; &quot; YOU tryi=\r\nng to convince yourself that &quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Births are spent on t=\r\nhis my boy, births not lives, it takes a lot of\n&gt; effort to tell and convin=\r\nce yourself that you are just not you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : and how do you do tha=\r\nt?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You\n&gt; =\r\neventually yourself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus\n&gt; re=\r\nalizing the deity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the\n&gt; one (=\r\nthe source of all the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man\n&gt; ki tar=\r\nana, does it not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am t=\r\nhe battery and not\n&gt; this personality?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you=\r\n&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, to\n&gt; yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: I am beginning =\r\nto understand a little, can you explain where\n&gt; does a deity stand in this =\r\nwhole battery concept?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : If you are the battery, the battery h=\r\nas to have a source, you\n&gt; are not svayambhu that you exist on you own. The=\r\n deity is like a huge\n&gt; power station in your comparison. It is almost infi=\r\nnite, but since it is\n&gt; a power station it is bound to have a boundary some=\r\nwhere, but to you, aa\n&gt; sized battery it is endless. Chaman&#39;s source is his=\r\n parents, but\n&gt; chaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery) parent is the power stat=\r\nion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Hmmm=85.. that&#39;s why she is worshipped as ma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teac=\r\nher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl who has realized that\n&gt; he/she=\r\n himself is the battery and then went on to become one with a\n&gt; power stati=\r\non and thus sees himself/herself in everything because the\n&gt; power station =\r\nis the source of everything , of all batteries. And since\n&gt; he/she actually=\r\n knows that all elements too are currents and everything\n&gt; else too, he/she=\r\n actually sees it as that. And thus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let\n&gt; say I fully well=\r\n don&#39;t see a difference between me and this table, thus\n&gt; I am this table, =\r\nthus If i wish to make it fly, I can do it, because I\n&gt; am actually it. To =\r\nyou it is a table, to me it is just a current, who is\n&gt; just &quot;me&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stu=\r\ndent: Oooohhhhhhhh=85=85.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but that=\r\ns how your eyes perceive him\n&gt; to be as, an old man with frail clothing, be=\r\nlongs to shirdi etc etc, but\n&gt; inside he is far beyond what you or I can co=\r\nmprehend. He first realized\n&gt; he was a battery by doing penance, thus killi=\r\nng himself in the process,\n&gt; the he realized that the battery is as good as=\r\n the power station because\n&gt; the current is the same, so he became one with=\r\n that, and then he went\n&gt; beyond and came back to guide as he was chosen, j=\r\nust like many others\n&gt; are, like my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakris=\r\nhna and all\n&gt; others=85=85=85\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : And the source of the power st=\r\nation is?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : The one- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put=\r\n into words\n&gt; because he is infinite and the words are finite. It is purely=\r\n on\n&gt; defining him religious wars, riots between religions , and intellectu=\r\nal\n&gt; discussions and debates on this thing called internet happen, but\n&gt; he=\r\n/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people focus on that , and\n&gt; get =\r\nlost, but focus on the power station (deity) and it will take you to\n&gt; big =\r\ndaddy.\n&gt; Imagine an endless field of current in comparison of the power sta=\r\ntion ,\n&gt; an endless current which exists and all others are a figment of it=\r\n. The\n&gt; power stations are a part of it, the current has taken the form of =\r\none\n&gt; concentrated zone.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck =\r\nit.\n&gt; The ultimate is only realized when you are one with the power station=\r\n so\n&gt; lets focus there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So the one has taken forms of differ=\r\nent power stations to help\n&gt; the batteries who are spread out to help unite=\r\n back with it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Brilliant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: So all our lives we =\r\ndebate/fight and cut each other off to\n&gt; claim which power station (deity) =\r\nis more powerful over the other and\n&gt; superior to all others, when in truth=\r\n our eyes perceive them(deities) to\n&gt; be different, when they are in essenc=\r\ne one(Satya shri akaal) and\n&gt; laughing back at us?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : ho ho ho=\r\n=85.. Go on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : And we try to worship 10 different ones and alw=\r\nays think that\n&gt; we should worship as many to get maximum benefit for our m=\r\nistakingly\n&gt; confused identities of teddy , the car and all other toys?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Teacher : *smokes slowly*=85 I am listening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: So the biggest=\r\n fools are those who are lost in debates and\n&gt; pseudo breathing in and out =\r\nand raising kundalinis with peacock feathers\n&gt; and punches to the spine, re=\r\nading stuff and debating on concepts which\n&gt; they don&#39;t know a thing about?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the\n=\r\n&gt; battery. the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of &quot;my\n&gt; kundal=\r\nini&quot;, err=85. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,\n&gt; many mak=\r\ne this error, but it is essential because other wise you can&#39;t\n&gt; explain th=\r\ne concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,\n&gt; &quot;you&quot; will =\r\nbe phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets\n&gt; say a form,=\r\n you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full\n&gt; glory . Whatever=\r\n you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the\n&gt; limitations of Cham=\r\nan/teddy/car/toy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: So then how do realized souls stay in their=\r\n bodies post their\n&gt; realization?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher: Intentional identification =\r\nwith the personality by permission\n&gt; from the power station to fulfill some=\r\n higher purpose of the power\n&gt; station to guide more batteries to realize t=\r\nhat they are not toys. But\n&gt; they can leave in an instant, because they kno=\r\nw realities that are much\n&gt; higher than our world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So what i=\r\ns moksha?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you ha=\r\nven&#39;t merged\n&gt; back with a power station yourself first. You tell me when y=\r\nou have\n&gt; merged back, how do you know what if feels like to be merged back=\r\n? You\n&gt; yourself have become one with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, e=\r\nven\n&gt; the battery has dissolved, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remem=\r\nber\n&gt; it, because you are not there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I can&#39;t explain it.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Teacher : We can&#39;t, It is like explaining the color red to a blind man.\n&gt;=\r\n You will say mars  is red or the red light is red, he will say I have\n&gt; be=\r\nen blind from birth I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. You will\n&gt; say=\r\n tomato, he will say fuck off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : it can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convolu=\r\nted\n&gt; topic. To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one t=\r\noy\n&gt; is a helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, bu=\r\nt\n&gt; the car is very different form the toy, thus if you explain a high leve=\r\nl\n&gt; concept to both, both will understand differently and have a go at it\n&gt;=\r\n with debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is both\n&gt;=\r\n realize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are duracell\n&gt; f=\r\nirst, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.\n&gt; Now=\r\n time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\ntudent : What?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : You thought 4 times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: But I will=\r\n be disgraced.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they =\r\nwill laugh at\n&gt; Chaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this=\r\n thousand\n&gt; times before, so what??\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I hate you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher=\r\n : I love you too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : You are serious on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : V=\r\nery\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: : This is why some of the higher ones don&#39;t give a shit a=\r\nbout\n&gt; roaming naked and doing wild stuff, just to keep people away from th=\r\nem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Yes, but a lot of frauds copy and disgrace the higher on=\r\nes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Fine, I will do it. But you will handle my parent&#39;s reac=\r\ntion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Done.\n&gt; \n&gt; After the student did the act, nobody seeme=\r\nd to recall the act the next\n&gt; day, yet every one saw it that day, and seem=\r\ned to make faces at the\n&gt; student for an hour or so. How everybody forgot i=\r\ns a different story\n&gt; altogether.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do sadhana, before your battery is p=\r\nulled out, replugged into another\n&gt; toy and yet again, your confusion will =\r\nprevail driving you to do things\n&gt; that will push you further and further d=\r\nown.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Shree Radheya!!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
