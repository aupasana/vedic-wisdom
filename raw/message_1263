I just f=\r\ninished the \nChani Paath. What i read is 13 chapters and then &#39;Kunjika Stot=\r\nra&#39;to \nconclude.\n\nKunjika Stotra says two things which creates some confusi=\r\non if you go \nby letral menaing:\n\n* Yen Mantra Prabhaven ChandiJapo Shubho =\r\nBhavet:\n  (With the power of this mantra, Chandi Path becomes     \nAuspicio=\r\nus/Fruitfull)\n\n* KunjikaPaathMatren DurgaPaatham Phalam Labhet:\n(Only by re=\r\nciting Kunjika Stotra, one can get Fruit of Chandi paath)\n\nThe former one s=\r\nays that Kunjika Stotra will make Chandi Paath a \nSuccess which means that =\r\nit is a recitation in addition to the Chandi \nPaath while later one indicat=\r\nes that Kunjika Stotra can be a \nreplacement of Chandi Paath.\n\n***\n\nHonestl=\r\ny, I am not reading Kunjika Stotra because it says that you \ndon&#39;t need to =\r\nrecite Argala, Kavach, Kilakam, Rahsyaas etc.. not \nbecause Shiva says that=\r\n it is a effective shortcut But becuase i \nreally really like the rhydhm of=\r\n Kunjika stotra. it give me great Joy \nto recite it--\n\nspecially the verses=\r\n such as \nDham Dhim Dhum Dhurjate Patni, Vaam Vim Vum Vaagahishwari\nKraan K=\r\nrin krun Kaaika devi, Shan Sahin Shun me Shubham Kuru\nBhram Bhrim Bhrum....=\r\nDhijagram Dhijagram....Paam Peem Pum\n\nI love to read it loudly.\n\nJay Jagada=\r\nmba!!!\n\nHappy MahaShiv Raatri to allthe members and thankyou to Narasimha f=\r\nor \nShiva Manual at the Right time\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; For someone who cannot speak sanskrit or is not even very fluent \nwith=\r\n \n&gt; any of the Indian lnaguges, can such a person do a homa of the \nKunjika=\r\n \n&gt; Stotra instead of the actual full Durgasaptasati. Specially since in \n&gt;=\r\n the beginning of the Kunjika, it says Kunjika path is almost \n&gt; equivalent=\r\n to Durgasaptasti.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
