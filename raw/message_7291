We can safely assume that no human in this age can compl=\r\netely understand the exact esoteric significance of each verse,=C2=A0let al=\r\none=C2=A0each word of the Chandi.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But the potency of the text is=\r\n due to it being a revealed text, even if one does not understand a single =\r\nword of it and yet keeps chanting it, results will come unfailing! There ar=\r\ne a few explanatory books of the Chandi by many esteemed spiritual people, =\r\nthe most famous being that by Sri Nagoji Bhatta and Sri Bhaskaracharya. In =\r\nBengali there are=C2=A0quite a=C2=A0few=C2=A0very beautiful texts providing=\r\n different interpretations of the Chandi, but sadly none of them are in Eng=\r\nlish. Again Sri Shayama Charun Lahiri used had also given some comments on =\r\nthe Chandi from a Yogic point of view. Each of the=C2=A0three Charittras=C2=\r\n=A0represent one of the three Granthis - Brahma,=C2=A0Vishnu and=C2=A0Rudra=\r\n Granthi.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If you can get a copy of the Chandi published by the R=\r\namakrishna Mission, then read the preface. It is an nice scholarly work on =\r\nthe history of this text. Btw, the Ramakrishna Mission published Chandi has=\r\n some differences in verses from the Gita Press. The former being more popu=\r\nlar in Bengal and Assam while the later being more popular in North India a=\r\nnd the rest of India. However,=C2=A0BOTH work equally well when it comes to=\r\n experiencing spirituality.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mer=\r\ne aage\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek baat hai=\r\nn ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 22 September 2011 9:39 PM\n&gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Durga SapthaSathi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste, \n&gt; \n&gt; Ma=\r\nny many thanks to Shri PVR Narasimha Rao Garu for this excellent forum and =\r\nall the guidance that he and other learned people offer here, Free of any c=\r\nost! \n&gt; \n&gt; With your constant Sat-Sangatya, I was able to keep the motivati=\r\non for good things and have just completed reciting Durga SaptaSathi 107 ti=\r\nmes. I am completing the last time on the Chaturdasi before the Navaratris =\r\nbegin. During Navaratris I plan to perform Chandi Homam with 700 verses. Cu=\r\nrrently I am doing Chandi Homam daily with only Durga Sapta Sloki because I=\r\n am doing chanting otherwise. Sapta Sati, tough as it seemed in the beginni=\r\nng, became a lot more easier for me to chant now (that was the objective wi=\r\nth which I have taken up this 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I plan to m=\r\nemorize all that. On this occasion, I have a question for Shri Narasimha Ga=\r\nru. I have come across a writing somewhere on Sapta Sati as to how it can b=\r\ne a mantra Sastra. The second verse &quot;SavarniH Soorya TanayOH .....&quot; was int=\r\nerpreted to as &quot;Hreem..&quot; beejakshara mantra. Do we have a book that explain=\r\ns all of the SaptaSati in several contexts, the literal meaning, esoteric\n&gt;=\r\n  meaning, the several mantras that the verses represent etc.? If there is =\r\nno book like that, I would request Shri PVR to author such a book because o=\r\nf his deep insights into the subject/language and the advanced sadhaka that=\r\n he is! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
