He is married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n=A0\nBefor=\r\ne I tell you anything more=A0about his spiritual life=A0that I know, let me=\r\n say=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him about=\r\n two years back. What first attracted me to=A0 towards him was his impeccab=\r\nle honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=A0when it comes to=A0honestly.=A0If som=\r\neone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmle=\r\nss=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he nev=\r\ner jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=A0spoken even a single=\r\n lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his t=\r\neacher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed =\r\nhis teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive lang=\r\nuage and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he b=\r\nought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for te=\r\nn years every day he spend one\n hour reading the English dictionary and one=\r\n hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=A0up volumes of Hindi=\r\n and English literature.=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is because=\r\n he wanted to be=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one day he c=\r\nan take a really detached view to judge the truth about=A0which is more com=\r\nprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it c=\r\nomes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is =\r\nmathematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education t=\r\no journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes=\r\n fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French=\r\n. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. =\r\nWhen he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying fo=\r\nr a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk=\r\n who was\n supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked my frie=\r\nnd&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my f=\r\nriend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Because,=\r\n he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would have =\r\nbeen a lie. \n=A0\nSo this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. Al=\r\nl his friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n=A0\nOne day, =\r\nlong back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to offic=\r\ne passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=A0his scooter, sudden=\r\nly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not =\r\nknow why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in th=\r\ne morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he ha=\r\ns no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest s=\r\naid that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the=\r\n whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb=\r\n him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, a=\r\ns if he was in deep sleep.\n=A0\nThen he started meditating at home, and it w=\r\nas there=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about t=\r\nhese, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. But on=\r\nce he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in =\r\nthe exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=A0Only his =\r\nwife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when =\r\never he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When some=\r\none asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the w=\r\nhole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the pla=\r\nnets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, sm=\r\naller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately des=\r\nribed.=A0He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal=\r\n man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it=\r\n\n elevated Sri=A0Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal =\r\nValmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=A0not a God.The diff=\r\nerence he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ord=\r\ninary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be =\r\nemulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=A0can try to l=\r\nead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely s=\r\ntating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and =\r\nadvises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is n=\r\not an atheist any more.\n=A0\nLater he had once=A0mentioned he knew the relat=\r\nion he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he =\r\nsays, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of ti=\r\nme on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=A0with t=\r\nhose in=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and everything wit=\r\nh them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea=\r\n is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the future of thi=\r\ns country.\n=A0\nHe is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fis=\r\nh, meat etc.\n=A0\nI shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not=\r\n asked his permission before mentioning him.\n=A0\n-Regards\n=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nPS:=\r\n I would not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.

As I said, he has an uncompromising attitu=\r\nde when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he =\r\nis a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to=\r\n education to journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speak=\r\ns and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Per=\r\nsian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above=\r\n languages. When he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While=\r\n applying for a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. Wh=\r\nen the clerk who was\n supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he a=\r\nsked my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seein=\r\ng this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right the=\r\nre. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form=\r\n would have been a lie. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;So this gives a basic=\r\n idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, call=\r\ns him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;One day, long back, he=\r\n was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a=\r\n Krishna temple. As he was passing by in&nbsp;his scooter, suddenly he felt=\r\n a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why h=\r\ne went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning.=\r\n Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowl=\r\nedge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that h=\r\ne went into the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole tim=\r\ne without any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But =\r\nmy friend had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he wa=\r\ns in deep sleep.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Then he started meditating at=\r\n home, and it was there&nbsp;that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does no=\r\nt say much about these, infact most people who know him also do not know th=\r\nese things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his me=\r\nditation seat, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continu=\r\nously.&nbsp;Only his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I b=\r\nelieve nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state =\r\nof Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said=\r\n it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moo=\r\nn, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the=\r\n water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It can=\r\nnot be accurately desribed.&nbsp;He considers Sri Krishna to be God and&nbs=\r\np;Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit=\r\n Manas because he thinks it\n elevated Sri&nbsp;Rama to the level of a God w=\r\nhereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an i=\r\ndeal &lt;em&gt;man,&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal =\r\nman is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to b=\r\necome like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One can=\r\nnot become Krishna, but one&nbsp;can try to lead his life like Rama. I have=\r\n argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does =\r\nnot have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust mo=\r\nst Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Later he had once&nbsp;mentioned he knew the relatio=\r\nn he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he sa=\r\nys, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time=\r\n on different internet forums interacting with people, specially&nbsp;with =\r\nthose in&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and everything=\r\n with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His =\r\nidea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the future of=\r\n this country.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;He is am omnivorous person. Lik=\r\ne any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I sh=\r\nall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not asked his permission=\r\n before mentioning him.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;PS: I would not like this mail to b=\r\ne considered as a part of the debate.

Do you know=\r\n him as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he follow=\r\ning?? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes happened in =\r\nhis life after&nbsp; he had these samadhi and visions.Any other special thi=\r\nngs about him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Gita Lord is saying whatever you do/eat offer =\r\nit to me first. So he is offering all these non-veg to Lord with devotion, =\r\nRight?? Then prasdam all around??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My curious questions are not again=\r\nst your acceptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is\n par=\r\nt of hidden violence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome&nbsp; pain and misery=\r\n on animals and birds on his behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is =\r\nexperiencing all these exotic&nbsp; visions, But no feeling of kindness tow=\r\nards birds and animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where did I go wrong? Simple dal/roti and do=\r\n not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we g=\r\net burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/article&nbsp=\r\n; about Dayamata who succeded&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she went to I=\r\nndia and told a Spiritual Master that her progress has stopped. Master said=\r\n, you are eating eggs which she admitted that she was doing&nbsp; secretly.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is very complex world. No outright solutions for so many diffi=\r\ncult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originated in middle east a=\r\nre fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, from which part of =\r\nSpiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also enemies\n there?? Thei=\r\nr Gods said in their holy books that animals are their food. So they cannot=\r\n even think about souls in animals or their pain and emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then =\r\nI have read stories about several people, who follow these faiths and are n=\r\non-veg and how they exexperience&nbsp; spiritual highs and other such pheno=\r\nmena. It is so difficult to comprehend.&nbsp; Would they remain in the cycl=\r\ne of b/d&nbsp; till they learn about kindness???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kind Regards&lt;br&gt;Lax=\r\nmiNarayan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On Sat, 12/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajar=\r\nshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbo=\r\ndy&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; \nThe INTERNET now has a personalit=\r\ny.
