Bhagavan never used to=\r\n compromise with equality in serving meals.He never\nagreed to accept anythi=\r\nng which is not equally shared by His fellow\ndiners.He was satisfied only w=\r\nhen He was served in the end, after everyone\nwas served.Even under exceptio=\r\nnal situations, He was not willing to take the\nfood of superior quality unl=\r\ness it was distributed to all.\n\n5. Bhagavan made people of different tongue=\r\ns in South India quite at home by\nspeaking or writing in their respective l=\r\nanguages.It requires a great effort\nto cross the narrow linguistic barriers=\r\n and shed the unjustifable prejudices\nagainst other languages and appreciat=\r\ne good works in them.
