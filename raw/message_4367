The goal is to have a reasonable target and meet it. Don&#39;t worry if you are doing between 12 and 25 and don&#39;t know the exact count.\n \n(3) Yes. If you see the super-short version, only one mantra (om gam gaNapataye namaH) is given. Offer any number of mantras, each any number of times, as you wish.\n \n(4) That&#39;s fine. Try to maintain around the same time everyday (if you can).\n \n(5) That is ok.\n \n(6) No, it is not mandatory. If people always ate Jalebi with milk in old days, it does not mean you should not eat Jalebi if you don&#39;t have milk. Jalebi is tasty without dipping in milk too!\n \nIn fact, people put too much emphasis on the external ritual of sandhyavandanam and forget the essence.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOnce I went to a Maharudram (chanting of Rudra namakam 1331 times by all participating ritviks together) conducted at a temple as a participating ritvik. After chanting the whole morning, we were given a break at noon and we were all taken outside to do our sandhyavandanam. All the learned brahmins who came as ritviks sat down in the traditional pose on the ground and did ten minutes of an external ritual by touching various body parts, sprinking water in various places etc. Clearly, they were learned in tradition and did it well. But, when they finished the ritual, they all got up and went to have food.\n \nIn the old days, people did ten minutes of external ritual and then did japam (meditation) with Gayatri mantra for an hour. If all you have is 5-10 minutes, it is more useful to skip sandhyavandana and do japam right away. Unfortunately, busy people of Kali yuga are making a wrong tradeoff!\n \nDon&#39;t get me wrong. I do not want to downplay the importance of sandhyavandanam. However, spending 5-10 minutes in sandhyavandanam and 0 minutes on actual Gayatri japam is a bad tradeoff IMHO.\n \nTaking the dal (lentil soup) in your hand, looking at it intently for 2 minutes, transferring it from one hand to another, smelling it, touching it gently with the tip of tongue may be a good ritual that makes your digestive juices flow and helps you digest better. But, if you do that ritual and then leave without eating the dal, what good is it and what strength are you going to get from it? If you are in a hurry, you are better off eating the soup without that ritual before it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn my opinion, doing sadhyavandana is not mandatory for homam. It is not mandatory for even doing japam with Gayatri mantra. If you have time, do sandhyavandanam and then 5-10 maalaas of Gayatri mantra, in addition to homam. If you do not have such time, you are better off doing just homam and meditating at the end.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI am quite inspired to hear from several people who never lit a lamp in their life before and are enjoying homam by themselves now. Manish firmly belives that these are just the early days and homam will become a very popular spiritual practice (again!) and hundreds of thousands of people will be doing homam regularly in coming years.\n \nThe main goal of religion is to take one to god and make one *experience* god in some manner or the other. However, with deepening Kali, several organized religions have become corrupted and dogmatic and deviating from the main goal more and more. This is causing unneeded clashes between people of &quot;faith&quot; and strife in the world and dissuading more and more intelligent and educated people from the pursuit of god.\n \nAs shrill and empty rhetoric starts to afflict organized religions, what the world needs is not a new organized religion or a new prophet. World needs to rediscover sanatana dharma (the path of perennial righteousness). What the world needs is a sadhana of rishis, which uses the &quot;living god&quot; that everyone has access to (i.e. fire) and which enables people to experience god eventually. Manish belives thousands of people will make swift spiritual progress through homam and restore some tolerable level of dharma in the world.\n \n*        *        *\n \n(7) It may not mean anything and may not be connected to homam. Don&#39;t worry.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- samhhp_g &lt;hari.sarma@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt;   Namaste,\n&gt;     First of all I would like to thank guru&#39;s Narasimha garu and Pt\n&gt; Manish-ji for spreading out the divine message of performing homaMs and\n&gt; the essential&#39;s of sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Please forgive me for the long mail...\n&gt; \n&gt;       I always had a wish to start doing homaM&#39;s after joining the group,\n&gt; but I stay in a rented house and was feared about the consequences that\n&gt; I need to face from neighbors and the landlord (it&#39;s a closely\n&gt; packed house with very less ventilation) but somehow dared and started\n&gt; doing gaNapati homaM daily since a month and a half, no issues yet by\n&gt; his divine grace but of course need more of that to destroy the enemies\n&gt; inside.\n&gt; \n&gt;     I am planning to shift to chanDii homaM after I complete 108 of\n&gt; gaNapati homaMs.\n&gt; \n&gt;     I just wanted to ask some questions and take opinion&#39;s on the\n&gt; following matters, some of them might have already been answered on the\n&gt; group, providing a reference link would be of great help in that case :-\n&gt;     1. Most often the attention is drawn towards the fire while\n&gt; meditating after pUrNaahuti, is it okay to meditate keeping the eyes\n&gt; open and with some focus on fire?\n&gt;     2. Many of a time&#39;s i lose track of how many beeja mantras/veda\n&gt; mantras i am offering and offer more than 12/less than 25, is that\n&gt; acceptable?\n&gt;     3. When running out of time I read atharvashIrShaM only once, will\n&gt; that be acceptable?\n&gt;     4. I end up doing homaMs at night most of the times because of issues\n&gt; in getting up early in mornings as I stay late to take conference calls\n&gt; etc...\n&gt;     5. I reserved a room to do homaMs, I was doing homaMs even when my\n&gt; wife was on her periods (she does not enter the homaM room during those\n&gt; times). Will that be okay or I need to give a break to homaM during\n&gt; those times?\n&gt;     6. I am one of the guys who never did lit a lamp in my life time till\n&gt; month and a half back, I stopped doing sandhyavandanaM 23 years back, is\n&gt; it mandatory to perform sandhyavandanaM to do homaM&#39;s?\n&gt;     7. There were some rats at home (I think 5 of them, that are very\n&gt; large sized, but are not bandicoots), all of them died after I started\n&gt; homaM&#39;s [:(] , by the way I never wished that (but killed a couple of\n&gt; them long back, but did not try killing other&#39;s even after getting a\n&gt; chance since an year), is that a bad sign of doing something wrong at\n&gt; homaM? Sometimes I feel the smoke has killed them (i do homaM with dry\n&gt; coconut, but offered large fruits like apple etc... a couple of times in\n&gt; pUrNaahuti which generated a lot of smoke), but then other creatures\n&gt; like lizards, spiders, ants are okay.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thank You,\n&gt; \n&gt; sarma.\n\n\n"}}
