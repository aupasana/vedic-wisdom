For example, one may do it to look good or impress others. Similarl=\r\ny, hurting someone is not necessarily taamasik/raajasik, when it is a resul=\r\nt of a light ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest =\r\nwith his foot was a divine drama for a higher purpose.\n \nCopying the action=\r\ns of divine beings requires some intelligence. To borrow an idiom from my m=\r\nother tongue, a fox does not become a tiger if it paints stripes on its bod=\r\ny.\n \nPeople you are talking about are very high level beings. Those who eff=\r\nace their ego and start to self-identify with some higher deities will star=\r\nt to exhibit the nature of those deities. Their actions may be fierce at ti=\r\nmes, but their purpose will be divine.\n \nWhether one wants liberation or on=\r\ne wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga (oneness) of a deity or whatever on=\r\ne wants, the first step is to efface ego. All sadhanas are meant for that o=\r\nnly. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or someone else achieved, the =\r\nstarting point is to efface your ego through sadhana. As you make progress,=\r\n at some stage, you may start seeing some results.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\n&gt; Nobody here I\n&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few roun=\r\nds of rosary for a\n&gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required su=\r\nch that our sadhana\n&gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us.\n \n=\r\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if one is thin=\r\nking of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a century today&quot; is u=\r\nnlikely to score a century. The best strategy is to take it a ball at a tim=\r\ne and focus. Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to stop thinking about =\r\nresults and just focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.\n \nMoreover, liberation is =\r\nnot ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he would come back a =\r\ncentury later and that people would be liberated en masse in that birth. Ev=\r\nen in these times, it is possible to be liberated.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nBhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Manish con=\r\nsiders himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar nature. I a=\r\nm privately aware of some incidents similar to what you described below wit=\r\nh Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish&#39;s mesage is to do sadhana and=\r\n efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom/message/3481\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.or=\r\ng\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyoti=\r\nsh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Bhupendra Ja=\r\nmnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Atul Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Vimalananda cert=\r\nainly seems like a cool person when we read about him but to say\n&gt; that som=\r\netimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not learn well\n&gt; =\r\nis an understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book when he goes =\r\nto a\n&gt; cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? After a br=\r\nief\n&gt; argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0he dies! Similar=\r\nly when Robert\n&gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV interv=\r\niew, Vimalananda goes\n&gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his reasons=\r\n for not acknowledging him.\n&gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw attention to =\r\nhimself and secondly he was\n&gt; sick,=C2=A0and that was the reason why Robert=\r\n did not acknowledge any help he had\n&gt; received from Vimalananda - to avoid=\r\n people crowding at his door, but\n&gt; Vimalananda could not be pacified and h=\r\nad the TV transmission disabled at the\n&gt; time the interview was going to be=\r\n aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking\n&gt; acknowledgement even when he claims h=\r\ne does not like public attention! Probably\n&gt; transmission breaking down was=\r\n again part of divine will you think? Robert\n&gt; Sbvoboda himself mentions in=\r\n the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda\n&gt; was impossible especia=\r\nlly when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to his\n&gt; mistake.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhen there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience =\r\nby a\n&gt; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curse=\r\ns this ill\n&gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally su=\r\nccumbs to that and\n&gt; dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am denied aud=\r\nience, do I curse them to\n&gt; death?\n&gt;\n&gt; The examples I give above does not i=\r\nllustrate a picture of people who were\n&gt; compassionate and always willing t=\r\no forgive and forget. But still, they were\n&gt; hugely successful in their sad=\r\nhana in their own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; talking about here....the =\r\npre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n&gt; thinks expects to ache=\r\nive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; particular mantra..=\r\n..but certianly what is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; produces results t=\r\nhat are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling though\n&gt; that there=\r\n is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those\n&gt; pre-requisites. I=\r\n guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and continue\n&gt; without to=\r\n let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradually.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if =\r\nthose\n&gt; channels are not clean then that energy flow can create unpleasant =\r\nexperiences\n&gt; like increased anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are =\r\nclean enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rishis have clean channels and they flow along with divin=\r\ne will. curses and\n&gt; blessings they give are just part of divine will. like=\r\n curse given to lord\n&gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarl=\r\ny curses given to yadav\n&gt; vansh and king prikshit played an important role.=\r\n vimlananda was a cool guy\n&gt; except few times when he was markedly irritate=\r\nd.Like in an incidence where one\n&gt; of his female disciple tried to illude h=\r\nim by coming almost naked in front of\n&gt; him to learn how to become a bhaira=\r\nvi. he was irritated because he felt that his\n&gt; student did not learnt well=\r\n what he taught to her.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On other side people with some impurities lik=\r\ne i-ness and pride may not be able\n&gt; to handle that energy well. and can ex=\r\nperience increased anger lust etc. like\n&gt; ravana and sadhaka u are mentioni=\r\nng.
