These five elements are ruled by Ganapathi, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBrahma, Lakshmi & Vishnu, Rudra and Gouri. So we pray to them as they \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; control our astitva or identity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Literal meaning of =E2=80=\r\n=9Cgraha=E2=80=9D is one that grabs. We experience things as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grahas =\r\nor planets grab our consciousness and make it experience the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; results=\r\n (reactions) of various actions performed by us in the past. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grahas =\r\nare the agents of karma phala (fruits of previous actions). Thus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gr=\r\nahas control our bhoktritva or experiencership. So we pray to them, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwith ruling and co-ruling deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ten dikpalakas rule the ten=\r\n directions (eight 2-dimensional directions, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up and down). They not =\r\nonly rule the physical directions, but the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; direction one takes in li=\r\nfe with one&#39;s work. For example, in Vedic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; astrology, a chart called =\r\ndasamsa shows one&#39;s work in society and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ten parts of that chart =\r\nare ruled by dikpalakas showing different kinds \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of work. Indra, for =\r\nexample, shows work that asserts authority and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; control over others (=\r\ne.g. political leaders, managers). Agni, for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, shows work tha=\r\nt transforms things (e.g. engineers, designers). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yama shows work rel=\r\nated to enforcing rules (e.g. quality assurance, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; police). Nirriti sh=\r\nows work that breaks barriers (e.g. mafia, cutting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; edge innovations)=\r\n. And so on. It is dikpalakas who control our kartritva \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or doership =\r\nand make us perform different types of actions. So we pray \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to them.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
