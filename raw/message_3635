It is not a =\r\nfull\n&gt; stop or period, but just a comma. Let me tell a parable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A p=\r\nerson loved one dress and wore it always. He never removed the dress\n&gt; and =\r\nkept the dress on him all the time and never considered the possibility\n&gt; o=\r\nf changing into a different dress. The idea of removing that dress was\n&gt; un=\r\nbearable to that person. He thought he should wear that dress forever.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The dress became so dirty and torn that it was time to change it. A\n&gt; p=\r\nerson looking extremely scary came up to the person oneday to remove the\n&gt; =\r\ndress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated with him and tore it\n=\r\n&gt; apart violently if one fought back. After this scary person removed the o=\r\nld\n&gt; dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some people became so=\r\n\n&gt; afraid and ashamed when they lost old clothes that they ran away and roa=\r\nmed\n&gt; around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve=\r\n soon\n&gt; gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The clothes in this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy. The\n=\r\n&gt; person looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death.\n=\r\n&gt; Creator is the person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birt=\r\nh\n&gt; is the new clothes.

And I have been reading the posts on this forum\n&gt; with much awe and inter=\r\nest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (=\r\nafter struggling\n&gt; with renal failure and other complications) at our home =\r\nin Hyderabad. When\n&gt; we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi=\r\n for final rites, my\n&gt; mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(=\r\nRam naam satya hai -\n&gt; 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience=\r\n of doing a Chandi Homam\n&gt; on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and =\r\nI started wondering if I\n&gt; would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bh=\r\numi at Hyd. I thought how\n&gt; wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a =\r\nhomam on my dad&#39;s funeral -\n&gt; so that he would also attain some punya (as p=\r\ner the note). And then\n&gt; immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a =\r\nsimilar homam by myself,\n&gt; but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kid=\r\nding to even think that I\n&gt; can do such a feat. As we descended the steps o=\r\nf the smashaan bhumi, I\n&gt; started experiencing intensely subtle sensations =\r\nall over my\n&gt; body...especially\n&gt; &gt; in/around the abdominal region. As taug=\r\nht in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the\n&gt; sensations as equanimously as I could, a=\r\nnd told myself that &#39;even this would\n&gt; change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came =\r\nto my mind, that it is all at the level\n&gt; of the mind, and may be I should =\r\nperform a mini version of Chandi Homam in\n&gt; my mental imagery. But I still =\r\nwanted to have a tangible element to it, so I\n&gt; asked a friend, if he could=\r\n procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now\n&gt; when I think of it, thi=\r\ns friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he\n&gt; went away saying he=\r\n would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above\n&gt; 2 things and in=\r\n addition he bought some ghee.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was my first time at a sm=\r\nashaan bhumi, and also the very first time\n&gt; that I had seen death/dead bod=\r\ny at such close quarters. It was a very\n&gt; &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but =\r\nsoon after the fire was ignited (by my\n&gt; eldest brother - exactly at sunset=\r\n time), I composed myself, went in the\n&gt; direction opposite to where all th=\r\ne friends/relatives were standing and sat\n&gt; down on a stone platform in suk=\r\nhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to\n&gt; sit on either side, told them=\r\n that I would like to meditate, and requested\n&gt; them to let me know if &#39;som=\r\nething&#39; happens. I had already observed a brown\n&gt; colored dog (thanks to th=\r\ne vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we\n&gt; reached the funeral-pyre p=\r\nlatform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to\n&gt; behave a little different=\r\nly (silly me!!):).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth,=\r\n my parents, my grandparents, the\n&gt; Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their s=\r\nupport and blessings in my very first\n&gt; attempt in doing such a ritual. Bei=\r\nng a Vipassana meditator, I am used to\n&gt; focussing on breath, and I saw my =\r\nbreathing was a little fast. I continued\n&gt; watching my breath for few minut=\r\nes and soon, I was centred enough. I\n&gt; remembered the warning that this sho=\r\nuld be done ONLY and ONLY with the\n&gt; purest intention of gaining spiritual =\r\nprogress; so I inspected my mind and\n&gt; found the truth to be different. I h=\r\nad a deep desire that my father\n&gt; accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his jour=\r\nney in the non-physical plane is\n&gt; &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further and =\r\nfelt that there was some\n&gt; thrill/excitement too in my mind about attemptin=\r\ng such a unconventional\n&gt; thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mentally s=\r\nurrendered myself and said\n&gt; &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker=\r\n, I have mundane desires.\n&gt; Everytime I have done\n&gt; &gt; homam in the past, I =\r\nhave asked you to purify my mind, because I have\n&gt; believed and still belie=\r\nve that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/\n&gt; nullification of my pas=\r\nt karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the\n&gt; same speed. Today as w=\r\nell, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure\n&gt; mind that I have, has=\r\n this mundane desire that his father attains some punya\n&gt; and his journey a=\r\nhead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you\n&gt; Maa, so please ac=\r\ncept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this\n&gt; homam. Please pard=\r\non this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After=\r\n this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral\n&gt; pyre (ev=\r\nen though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely\n&gt; because t=\r\nhe ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga\n&gt; Mantra=\r\n. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti,\n&gt; and i=\r\nt should not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could\n&gt; no=\r\nt just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in\n=\r\n&gt; colour, and fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - a=\r\nnd\n&gt; was trying to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had dev=\r\neloped\n&gt; in his feet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thoug=\r\nht sprung\n&gt; in my mind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chand=\r\ni who wears\n&gt; &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah=\r\n..okay..so this\n&gt; is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namask=\r\nar to Maa Chandi,\n&gt; repeated mentally the thoughts about the desire and sur=\r\nrendering of\n&gt; &gt; my ignorance. I sought permission from the deity to use a =\r\nDurga mantra by\n&gt; explaning the context. I also remember clearly, that I wa=\r\ns a little scared\n&gt; too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any =\r\nresults if she didnt\n&gt; deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me i=\r\nn any way for doing\n&gt; this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had a small mental dialogue w=\r\nith my father, wherein I briefed him about\n&gt; what I was going to do, and I =\r\nseeked his permission, forgiveness and\n&gt; blessings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And the=\r\nn I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried\n&gt; visualising that =\r\nI was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually\n&gt; visualise any =\r\nofferings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha\n&gt; at the end =\r\nof the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam\n&gt; without th=\r\ne swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the\n&gt; visualisation of=\r\n Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would\n&gt; visualise he=\r\nr lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing\n&gt; something. A few=\r\n minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden\n&gt; log - and thre=\r\nw it at a little distance in the direction which was opposite\n&gt; to mine. I =\r\nthink about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and\n&gt; wanted =\r\nto see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened\n&gt; my =\r\neyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told\n&gt; myself=\r\n, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but\n&gt; ne=\r\nvertheless I\n&gt; &gt; continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings =\r\nfluttering and\n&gt; opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was =\r\na rooster, as it\n&gt; had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come fro=\r\nm the piece of land\n&gt; next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a t=\r\nemple - am not sure)\n&gt; after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came c=\r\nlose to the burning\n&gt; funeral and started jumping and moving around the fun=\r\neral. It seemed as if\n&gt; the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. =\r\nAnother second it felt,\n&gt; perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was=\r\n amused with the fire\n&gt; particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down=\r\n on the earth, as a\n&gt; result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of=\r\n the funeral platform.\n&gt; I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at mys=\r\nelf, thinking a black hen\n&gt; came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said =\r\nI would continue until it is\n&gt; time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and =\r\nhe said 30 more minutes. So I\n&gt; &gt; continued the mental chanting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to leav=\r\ne. I\n&gt; waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the bla=\r\nck\n&gt; sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walke=\r\nd\n&gt; towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and a=\r\nsked\n&gt; her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it w=\r\nas\n&gt; sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far=\r\n did\n&gt; Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another =\r\ncousin\n&gt; of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and=\r\n join\n&gt; them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactl=\r\ny what\n&gt; was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone=\r\n to know\n&gt; that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied =\r\nthe contents\n&gt; of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi agai=\r\nn for my\n&gt; impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and th=\r\nrew it at\n&gt; the funeral\n&gt; &gt; pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again =\r\nand requested her to\n&gt; simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (inc=\r\nluding the yahoo group\n&gt; and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and j=\r\noined the group.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I was washing my hands and feet at th=\r\ne well, I looked at the funeral\n&gt; and now there was a red tinge to the fire=\r\n, which was not there before (could\n&gt; be because of black sesame seeds or j=\r\naggery??).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the way back home and for the entire evening,=\r\n I felt very very very\n&gt; quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense o=\r\nf achievement, because the\n&gt; thought of what happened was not strong in my =\r\nmind. I had neither forgotten,\n&gt; nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a=\r\n certian stillness within my\n&gt; existence that evening. I watched my breath =\r\nas much as I could. No\n&gt; judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;.=\r\n The visualisations could\n&gt; have been a product of my own imagination - but=\r\n the silence was real. And\n&gt; this experience of silence was the most beauti=\r\nful thing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle t=\r\nhat he had witnessed many\n&gt; fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and=\r\n somewhat special. I wondered\n&gt; if my brother was speaking out of &#39;percepti=\r\non&#39; or love for our father.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now that it is few days since t=\r\nhat incident, I have questions like - is\n&gt; the hen too, as sensitive as a d=\r\nog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the\n&gt; fire? Is there a connection =\r\nbetween the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people\n&gt; perform hen-sacrifice at=\r\n Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some\n&gt; &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If i=\r\nt did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and\n&gt; climb (as opposed to cli=\r\nmbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the\n&gt; next day when I was ch=\r\nanneling some reiki to him?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not sure if these question=\r\ns can be answered or if they should be\n&gt; answered at all, but based on the =\r\nabove experience, if anyone has any\n&gt; input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I=\r\n would be most appreciative.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajar=\r\nshi for the continued inspiration.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, apologies for the =\r\nlength of the note.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sharad\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd138a43c5d47047ec8aa08\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nAdesh!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am new here (hi!) so I&#39;ll jump right in and offer my op=\r\ninion. I have had experiences like you mention. In my case, I have found th=\r\nat she sounds like Aidevi (the goddess of one of the Natha panths). I was t=\r\nold this by someone very familiar with this particular face of Goddess.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;There are a couple of problems that spring to mind: first, MIND. It m=\r\nay be a darshan, it may just be your mind. If you follow it, it could lead =\r\nyou down an empty path. However, it really is your choice, you must follow =\r\nyour karmas as they lead you. In my case, I accept her as a sort of &quot;g=\r\nuardian&quot; and leave it at that. Other things shape your visualizations =\r\ntoo, including pure randomness, and passing images that float by. If you fe=\r\nel like accepting it as darshan, then do so. Just don&#39;t stake your clai=\r\nm on it. Your ego may possibly cling to it and distract you from the One.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Thu, Feb =\r\n4, 2010 at 8:22 PM, dahiyajiten &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:dah=\r\niyajiten@...&quot;&gt;dahiyajiten@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blo=\r\nckquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204,=\r\n 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Namaste Narsimhaji,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;One&#39;s beliefs, desires, pride, frustrations etc shape the imagery &=\r\ngt;&gt;one&#39;s mind visualizes.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\ni have asked this question earli=\r\ner also but somehow it is not very clear.If these things shape our visulais=\r\nations then what is the difference between this sort of visualisation/hallu=\r\ncination and the DARSHAN of deity.

He never removed the dress and kept the dress =\r\non him all the time and never considered the possibility of changing into a=\r\n different dress.

A person lo=\r\noking extremely scary came up to the person oneday to remove the dress. He =\r\nremoved the dress gently if one co-operated with him and tore it apart viol=\r\nently if one fought back. After this scary person removed the old dress, an=\r\nother person came and gave new clothes. Some people became so afraid and as=\r\nhamed when they lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed around naked=\r\n. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve soon gotten n=\r\new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhe clothes in this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy. The per=\r\nson looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creat=\r\nor is the person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birth is th=\r\ne new clothes. Persons running away in fear or shame before new clothese ar=\r\ne given are like different kinds of spirits.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regarding your visualization of your father usi=\r\nng reiki, please note that all visualizations of the mind are imagery creat=\r\ned by one&#39;s conscious and sub-conscious conditionining.

Also, there is no reliable way =\r\nto know if your prayers made any difference to the path taken by your fathe=\r\nr after the cremation.

And I have been=\r\n reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peace=\r\nfully (after struggling with renal failure and other complications) at our =\r\nhome in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan=\r\n bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant n=\r\notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experie=\r\nnce of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and=\r\n I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhu=\r\nmi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a hom=\r\nam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as pe=\r\nr the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a sim=\r\nilar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding =\r\nto even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the s=\r\nmashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over =\r\nmy body...especially&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;  in/around the abdominal region. As taught =\r\nin Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equanimously as I could=\r\n, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon after, a thou=\r\nght came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I =\r\nshould perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I s=\r\ntill wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he co=\r\nuld procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, th=\r\nis friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away saying he =\r\nwould try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in ad=\r\ndition he bought some ghee. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It wa=\r\ns my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I ha=\r\nd seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&=\r\n#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest br=\r\nother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in the direction o=\r\npposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and sat down on a =\r\nstone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on eit=\r\nher side, told them that I would like to meditate, and requested them to le=\r\nt me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already observed a brown co=\r\nlored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we r=\r\neached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to be=\r\nhave a little differently (silly me!!):). &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparen=\r\nts, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my v=\r\nery first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am=\r\n used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I c=\r\nontinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough.=\r\n I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the p=\r\nurest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and f=\r\nound the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumula=\r\ntes some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &=\r\n#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thr=\r\nill/excitement too in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing.=\r\n I did not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot=\r\n;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Eve=\r\nrytime I have done&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;  homam in the past, I have asked you to purif=\r\ny my mind, because I have believed and still believe that it won&#39;t be g=\r\nood to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karmas, if I continue=\r\n generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify =\r\nmy impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane desire that h=\r\nis father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincer=\r\ne, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurities and my ignor=\r\nance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yours if he is doi=\r\nng something wrong&quot;. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; After t=\r\nhis mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even t=\r\nhough I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONL=\r\nY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my =\r\nmind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should n=\r\not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visua=\r\nlise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and =\r\nfully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying =\r\nto co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his fe=\r\net, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mi=\r\nnd associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;ske=\r\nletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so thi=\r\ns is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi=\r\n, repeated mentally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n&gt;  my ignorance. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mant=\r\nra by explaning the context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little s=\r\ncared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she=\r\n didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for do=\r\ning this.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I had a small mental dia=\r\nlogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, a=\r\nnd I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - an=\r\nd tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not =\r\nactually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with =\r\nthe swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mant=\r\nra-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the=\r\n visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I=\r\n would visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing=\r\n something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden=\r\n log - and threw it at a little distance in the direction which was opposit=\r\ne to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious =\r\nand wanted to see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I o=\r\npened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told=\r\n myself, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, b=\r\nut nevertheless I&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;  continued. Few minutes later, I heard some so=\r\nund of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I th=\r\nink it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had=\r\n come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard=\r\n or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It c=\r\name close to the burning funeral and started jumping and moving around the =\r\nfuneral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die.=\r\n Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was =\r\namused with the fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling=\r\n down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof=\r\n of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at my=\r\nself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I=\r\n would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he =\r\nsaid 30 more minutes. So I&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;  continued the mental chanting. &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it =\r\nwas time for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towa=\r\nrds the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic=\r\n packet itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa=\r\n for my impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only =\r\nthree times, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and starte=\r\nd wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into t=\r\nhe fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me =\r\nto hurry up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not hav=\r\ne seen exactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did not =\r\nwant anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepp=\r\ned back, emptied the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised t=\r\no the Devi again for my impudence and requested her to accept this final of=\r\nfering and threw it at the funeral&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;  pyre from a distance. I than=\r\nked her once again and requested her to simply do the needful and then than=\r\nked everyone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quick=\r\nly walked and joined the group. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\nhen I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral an=\r\nd now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could =\r\nbe because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt very v=\r\nery very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievemen=\r\nt, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had ne=\r\nither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian=\r\n stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as=\r\n I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The=\r\n visualisations could have been a product of my own imagination - but the s=\r\nilence was real. And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thin=\r\ng. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The next day, I heard my broth=\r\ner tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday se=\r\nemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother was speaking ou=\r\nt of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now that it is few days since that incident, I have questio=\r\nns like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39=\r\n;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the =\r\nfact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did S=\r\nhakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did =\r\nI visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a h=\r\nalf-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to h=\r\nim? &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure if these questi=\r\nons can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the =\r\nabove experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I w=\r\nould be most appreciative.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thank you=\r\n PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Also, apologies for the length of the note.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sharad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 2=\r\n55); min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd138a43c5d47047ec8aa08--\r\n\n"}}
