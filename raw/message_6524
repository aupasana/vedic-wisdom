Attaining that st=\r\nate, the seers who are satisfied with knowledge, who are perfected souls, f=\r\nree from attraction, tranquil in mind, attaining that which is universally =\r\npresent, those wise devout souls enter into the All itself. As the flowing =\r\nrivers in the ocean disappear leaving their names and forms, so the knower,=\r\n being liberated from name and form, goes to the Supreme Purusha who is hig=\r\nher than the highest. He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman. In his family n=\r\no one who is ignorant of Brahman arises. He crosses over sorrow He crosses =\r\nover sin. Liberated from the knots of the heart, he becomes immortal.=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n\n\n"}}
