Without taking sannyasa you cannot live the life of detachment and renun=\r\nciation through mere independent thinking and through conscience. The dutie=\r\ns of life will be misunderstood without the shastras and the words of the r=\r\nealized persons (apta-vakya). The Lord Krishna says in the Gita: =E2=80=9CH=\r\ne who, having cast aside the ordinances of the scriptures, follows the prom=\r\nptings of his desires, does not attain perfection, nor happiness, nor the h=\r\nighest goal.=E2=80=9D\n\nTired with the mundane life of the world, and strivi=\r\nng for the realization and correct knowledge of the Self, pondering over th=\r\ne wisdom of the Upanishads which appertain to the science of Brahman, a rea=\r\nlly wise man should abandon his home and take to the life of sannyasa. Thos=\r\ne Brahmanas who, declaring protection to all creatures (i.e., sannyasins), =\r\nleave their homes and take to asceticism, attain to effulgent regions. \n\n\n"}}
