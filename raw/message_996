Shriram Sharma Acharya\n\nDear ALL,\n\n\n\n*The Trees Who Pray & Bathe*\n   It is now a scientifically established fact that plants and trees too\nhave life. They feel and breathe like other animals and also feel pleasure\nand pain. Long back, the pioneering experiments of the Indian scientist\nProf. J.C. Basu had conclusively proved as much. But although living\nentities, the life cycles of plants have certain inherent limitations. They\ncannot move from one place to another, and have to carry out all their vital\nactivities standing at one place during their life-cycle. Occasionally,\nhowever, some trees do defy these limitations and indulge in activities,\nwhich are extremely unusual and are still beyond the ambit of scientific\ncomprehension. Such phenomena go to reassert that nature hides within its\nbosom umpteen layers of mystery.\n\nSir J.C. Basu has enumerated many instances of highly extraordinary and\nawe-inspiring behavior of trees in his book &#39;Plant autographs and their\nrevelation&#39;. One such tree mentioned is a palm tree in Faridpur in West\nBengal (India). The tree, like all others of its ilk, remained erect\nthroughout the day time, its leaves swaying and rustling with every breeze -\nall very normal activities. But when the evening set in and the temples\nresounded with the uplifting sound of gongs and bells, this tree prostrated\nitself on the ground in the manner of offering prayer to God-knows-whom. A\nhuge crowd would gather there every evening to witness this spectacular\nsport of nature. It was commonly believed that this tree fulfilled one&#39;s\nwishes and cured physical and mental ailments. But how? This still remains a\nmystery.\n\nApart from offering prayers, trees have been known to take bath too! This\nsounds incredible, but Sir J.C. Basu has recorded many such phenomena of\nbathing trees. There was one such tree in Faridpur. It stood on the bank of\na pond. It remained calm and straight for the whole day, but with the onset\nof evening, it used to exhibit signs of growing restlessness as if to take a\ndip in the pond. Ultimately, after many visible attempts, it would gather\nthe leaves and branches around, bend, and submerge itself in the water of\nthe pond. After remaining in that underwater position for a while, it would\nagain gradually raise itself and revert to its normal posture, calm and\ncool. People had nicknamed it &#39;the bathing palm tree&#39;. No one knew the\nreason behind this mysterious propensity of the tree to bathe.\n\nSuch strange occurrences of tree-behavior, which pose a challenge to human\nknowledge and understanding, have been found outside India too. In many\ncountries, there are reports of the existence of &#39;praying&#39; and &#39;religious&#39;\ntrees, which draw people from far and wide to witness their unusual behavior\npatterns. About one particular tree in Liverpool, England, J.C. Basu writes\nthat it offered prayer in a distinctive manner. It was a thick willow tree\nby the side of a small stream. Unlike other praying trees, it prayed only\noccasionally. Then it would lie completely flat on the ground, and after\ncompletion of the prayer, raise itself erect. It prayed only in the morning\nand during this time, remained completely still, with no trace of any\nactivity.\n\nIn this community of peculiar trees, the case of the worshipping palm trees\nof South Africa is well known. These palm trees standing in a farmer&#39;s field\nonce happened to bend under the impact of a hurricane. From then onwards, a\nstrange change occurred in their behavior; every evening, they would\nroutinely bend or bow in worshipping posture. It is quite possible, and as\ntheir owners believed, that these trees might be praying to Mother Nature to\nprotect them from the onslaught of any future calamity. In any case, their\nnew routine of evening prayers continued uninterrupted.\n\nIn the coastal region of Florida, USA, there is a Rhizophora tree, which had\nalso earned some renown for its display of peculiar traits. It is said that\nin times of tide, when the seawater advanced towards the tree, its branches\nand leaves begin to exhibit unusual commotion. The branches would repeatedly\nbend and straighten as if trying to touch the water below. This laborious\neffort continues until the branches are able to touch the water. What else\ncould it be, if not a kind of desire to bathe?\n\nAll these instances of mysterious behavior make it sufficiently clear that\nnot only the subtle impulses of life are felt by the trees and plants too,\nbut sometimes they even overtly try to make these impulses manifest. It is\nanother matter that their flora-specific limitations do not allow full\nexpression of the flow of life current within. Scientists are engaged in\nfurther researches, and some success, too, has come their way. If this\nmystery is explained scientifically, we may be able to find the missing link\nbetween the flora and the fauna, between the humans and the trees. The\ndiscovery of this link would enable us to better comprehend the path of\nevolutionary progress of consciousness in human beings.\n\r\n--00163646d0d408bb94046147f16e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source : &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.awgp.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgp.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.awgpsouth.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgpsouth.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author : Pt.
