When moving parts of our gross bo=\r\ndy (e.g. lips) move the gross bodies of objects around us (particles in air=\r\n) and this vibration is perceived by the senses attached to the gross bodie=\r\ns of people around us (e.g. ears), that vibration is at the level of vaikha=\r\nri. When we are talking about pronunciation of mantras, we are essentially =\r\ntalking about vaikhari.\n \nBut we are not just our sthoola sareera (gross bo=\r\ndy). There is also a sookshma sareera (subtle body), kaarana sareera (causa=\r\nl body) and finally MahaKaarana sareera (cosmic body). Just as vibration in=\r\n sthoola sareera creates vaikhari, vibrations in other levels also create v=\r\nibrations at other levels.\n \nThe image you have in mind when you chant a ma=\r\nntra and the thoughts you are thinking when you chant a mantra go towards s=\r\nhaping the subtle vibrations behind a mantra. They vibrate the space around=\r\n you at the subtle level.\n \nOnce you cause of vibration of space around you=\r\n (at gross or subtle level), it is there. One with an ability to perceive i=\r\nt can perceive it. Of course, the deity of your mantra does not receive jus=\r\nt the gross vibration produced by you, but receives and responds to the ent=\r\nirety of the vibrations produced by you at all levels.\n \nVaikhari is the le=\r\nast powerful level and para is the most powerful level.\n \nAll the scholarly=\r\n preoccupation with the correct pronunciation etc is a little trite. The de=\r\nvotion, sense of surrender and the ability to create the correct mental ima=\r\nges and correct thoughts to accompany the chanting of the mantra are far mo=\r\nre important.\n \nOf course, it is helpful to pronounce the mantra correctly =\r\ntoo. I am not saying ignore the correct pronunciation. Do your BEST to get =\r\nit correct. But all I am saying is that that plays a small part and a bigge=\r\nr part is played by other factors which are often ignored. Do NOT ignore th=\r\nose.\n \nSecondly, being a child as opposed to an arrogant scholar helps with=\r\n gods. If you can be like a child who is lost by parents at a fair and cryi=\r\nng for them, it is easier to find god. As a matter of fact, we ARE almost l=\r\nike a clueless little children left by parents at the fair (of samsara)!\n \n=\r\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/h=\r\nomam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://w=\r\nww.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------- \n \n&gt; Dear Arpad,\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a very interesting acount you hav=\r\ne given.
