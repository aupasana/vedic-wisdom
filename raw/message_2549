Why should one worship Ganesha or Rudra or =\r\nChandika or Mahakala.\nIn fact can anybody actually worship any deity.\n\n1. T=\r\nhe fact of the matter is that one&#39;s mind will be drawn to the worship of de=\r\nities which one has worshipped in past lives.\n2. But, whether one will achi=\r\nve or not with that aspect of the divine is based on \n  a. What is the resi=\r\ndue of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera basically is responsible =\r\nfor this.One in a million \n      individuals will achieve the burning of th=\r\ne Karana Shareera. But when this is being done, then every karma done to th=\r\nat person\n     to his body or mind, good or bad must have an almost hundred=\r\n times more intensity result, like for like.\n     \n  b. What is the intensi=\r\nty of the desire of that person for the Divine Beloved?\n      Which again b=\r\noils down to the amount of karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker=\r\n the overlay of karmas, the lesser the  desire to actually perform any kind=\r\n of worship.\n\nPeople talk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.\nI find =\r\nthat it simply does not matter. \nEvery mantra is a name (nam), every nam ha=\r\ns a form (rupa).\nSo, when the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.\nWhere=\r\n is the rupa forming?\nIn the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.\nSo=\r\n the deity will actually occupy the person.\nBut when can this happen?\nOnly =\r\nwhen the body is dead. Not dead physically, but in a different sense.\nie. A=\r\nSANA: the mind forgets the body exists after a few hours of sitting really =\r\nstill for a few hours a day.\n    Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath=\r\n and feels it is alive, it tries to still the breath.\n    Dhyana, the rupa =\r\nof the deity forms in the mind, remember the body is dead for the mind at t=\r\nhis stage.\n    Dharana: The mind percieves that form of God which is the ob=\r\nject of the consciousness, but duality exists.\n    Pratyahara: a phenomenon=\r\n where the eyes do not see, the ears do not hear. \n    Samadhi: the rupa is=\r\n so well established, that the ultimate form of that rupa, that mantra, the=\r\n Nirguna manifests.\n\nSo the emptiness must come about in the mind and body =\r\nabout one&#39;s own identity before God fills it up with His form.\nSo, mantra i=\r\ns simply a tool to make us realise God. Anybody can do mantras, but most pe=\r\nople&#39;s internal fire or Agni is \nnot really charged up to digest these.\nJap=\r\na is no doubt great, but it is involved with the purification of air, where=\r\nas fire is involved in the purification of internal fire.\nWhen internal fir=\r\ne is purified, then the ability to visualise your deity becomes stronger. H=\r\nence homam in this age is easy and moreover, Agni is a living God, pratyaks=\r\nha Devata who can be seen by your physical eyes.\nIt moves, eats, talks with=\r\n the sadhaka and finally when it dies, it continues to live on within the s=\r\nadhaka.\nIn Kali Yuga, this ability to call a living God into the house is s=\r\no powerful and so exhalting that later on japa after homam\nbrings very fast=\r\n results.\nWhy Ganesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in any cas=\r\ne are not destined to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way they w=\r\nill pursue some sadhana is if they are given some material result quite qui=\r\nckly by their sadhana.\nThose who have problems in career, litigation, probl=\r\nems with marriage or in finding life partner, problems with education or sp=\r\neech can really advance their mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.\nI ha=\r\nve seen this numerous times myself with people who are in this movement and=\r\n outside.\nThat is not to say that Ganapati can&#39;t give Mukti. The ultimate f=\r\norm of Ganapati is the word of God.\nAnd He is sakshama in giving Mukti as w=\r\nell.\n\nThe mahamantras are many and I agree that some may say that lets do t=\r\nhis(mahamantras) first.\nBUT,\nThe Vedic mahamantras require the kind of into=\r\nnation so perfect with visualisation at different bits of the body with var=\r\nious syllables, that for most people this is not feasible, especially since=\r\n their Sanskrit itself is somewhat imperfect.(remember name is form, if nam=\r\ne is not repeated properly then how will the form be?)(example, of someone =\r\nwho repeated bhakshati for rakshati in Pune many years ago).\nAnd then there=\r\n are mahamantras which are ok with almost any intonation. If someone wants =\r\nto follow this that is also ok.\nBut, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadha=\r\nna is anivarya. Because, the entrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by H=\r\nim.\n\nAgain some doubt comes into people&#39;s heads about some mantras harming =\r\nthem when recited:\nIf somebody experiences bad things when a mantra of a ce=\r\nrtain deity is recited then all it means is that the karmas of the Karana s=\r\nhareera are being dealt with(by the deity) quite fast, so they have to be e=\r\nxperienced. It actually means that the Devata is close and more intense sad=\r\nhana is needed. \n\nActually, all this business about mantra and mahamantra i=\r\ns immaterial, Allah malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.\nUs parvardigar se prartha=\r\nna kar, woh sab raste khol deta hai.\n  \n\nWith humility\nManish\n\n\nOn Thu, Sep=\r\n 17, 2009 at 4:49 AM, pvr108 &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n  --- In sohamsa@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sanjayrath@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n  o=E1=B9  gurave =\r\nnama=E1=B8=A5\n\n  Dear Narasi=E1=B9 ha\n\n\n  Before I venture on this ...is th=\r\nis your opinion?

If you=\r\n are not pure, take help of the one who is not only pure but also purifies =\r\nwhatever he comes in contact with!\n\n  One who spends 30 minutes or more eve=\r\nryday in any homam will know the effect of fire on mind and can appreciate =\r\nwhy fire is called &quot;the purifier&quot; and why Parasara mentioned homam in prett=\r\ny much every remedy.\n\n  &gt; Please quote your source in support\n\n  (1) Releva=\r\nnce of Ganapathi: Punaranic saying &quot;Kalau Chandi Vinayakau&quot; (Chandi and Gan=\r\napathi save one in Kali).\n  (2) Importance of Ganapathi worship at the begi=\r\nnning: The puranic story of how Ganesha became the ruler of overcoming obst=\r\nacles.

However, looking at one&#39;s own knowledge as power, feeling pro=\r\nud and wanting to get some influence or authority over people using it is k=\r\nshatriya attitude. It does not lead to enlightenment. Such attitude restric=\r\nts the blooming of (and also the benefit to the world from) one&#39;s knowledge=\r\n.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; One should humbly look at oneself as an instrument of god and ope=\r\nrate guided by one&#39;s sense of dharma, without being sensitive to whether ot=\r\nhers are praising or criticizing one. Swami Vivekananda famously said once =\r\nthat Ramakrishna could have created 100 Vivekanandas from sand and whatever=\r\n he was and did was due to his guru&#39;s greatness. That is what I mean by hum=\r\nbly looking at oneself as an instrument. BTW, Swamiji was not one to show o=\r\nff fake humility. He spoke his mind frankly and always stood up for what he=\r\n believed in, with unmatched honesty, integrity, conviction and fearlessnes=\r\ns.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Surrender to god, ask for nothing (including any knowledge), be =\r\ngrateful for whatEVER He gives (including any knowledge) and do what you se=\r\ne as your dharma with what he gives you. THAT is the spirit of a braahmana.=\r\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Interestingly, one with a pure braahmana attitude automatically be=\r\ncomes powerful. One who wants power and control is upset when that is under=\r\nmined. One who wants money and profits is upset when that is underminded. H=\r\now can anyone upset one who wants nothing and does whatever one *can* with =\r\nwhatever one *has*? Freedom from desires (including desires related to know=\r\nledge) is the highest power.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; In not-so-old days, braahmanas roamed =\r\nthis earth who very pure like fire, who had no desires and who fulfilled wh=\r\nat they saw as their dharma without any expectations or inhibitions. No won=\r\nder such braahmanas exuded such power that the whole world was in awe of th=\r\nem and even mighty kings bowed before their &quot;power&quot;.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Your mail ha=\r\ns prompted me to delve into the homan section in you\n  &gt; &gt; website and shor=\r\ntly I will start with the homan with the various\n  &gt; &gt; templates you have c=\r\nited in your site.

As a spiritual=\r\n sadhana, it is a good idea to do Ganapathi homam for a few months before s=\r\ntarting any other homam. Ganapathi controls the mooladhara chakra, as well =\r\nas the the opening of the sushumna nadi. Thus, he protects one&#39;s material l=\r\nife and enables spiritual progress.

Appreciate =\r\nthem a lot.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; What I shared is the tip of the iceberg, just like =\r\nthe planetary special lagna concepts that I illustrated using Ve7 as an exa=\r\nmple sometime back.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; There are so many reference points in chart=\r\ns, so many houses and so many nakshatras. If one applies oneself intelligen=\r\ntly and tests using many examples, one can arrive at so many formulas using=\r\n what I gave as a template.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I will illustrate just one more pri=\r\nnciple. If the 6th house reckoned from AmK in D-10 and the 10th star (karma=\r\n nakshatra) reckoned from AmK in SBC have an influence of the same planet a=\r\nnd that planet is also associated with a trine from GL in rasi chart, one r=\r\nises to a position of power and influence in one&#39;s work. We are basically l=\r\nooking for synergy between (a) the professional (D-10) effort (6th) and (b)=\r\n mental (SBC) activity (10th star) of the spirit of work in one (AmK) and t=\r\nhe blessings (trines) related to power and influence (GL).\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Nehr=\r\nu&#39;s AmK is Rahu. From Ardra containing Rahu, the 10th star counted anti-zod=\r\niacally is Satabhishak. In SBC, it has vedha from Mercury and Venus. In D-1=\r\n0, the 6th house from Li containing Rahu counted anti-zodiacally is Ta. Ven=\r\nus owns it. In rasi chart, Venus is the lord of GL and joins the lord of th=\r\ne 5th house from GL.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Indira Gandhi&#39;s AmK is Venus. From Poorvas=\r\nhadha containing Venus, the 10th star is Aswini. In SBC, it has vedha from =\r\nMars and Jupiter. In D-10, the 6th house from Cn containing Venus is Sg. Ju=\r\npiter owns it. In rasi chart, Jupiter is the 9th lord from GL.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; =\r\nRajiv Gandhi&#39;s AmK is Rahu. From Punarvasu containing Rahu, the 10th star c=\r\nounted anti-zodiacally is Poorvabhadra. In SBC, it has vedha from nodes and=\r\n aspect from Mercury and Mars. In D-10, the 6th house from Pi containing Ra=\r\nhu counted anti-zodiacally is Li. Mars and Mercury aspect it from Ta. In ra=\r\nsi chart, Mervcury is the 9th lord from GL.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; PV Narasimha Rao&#39;s =\r\nAmK is Venus. From Krittika containing Venus, the 10th star is Uttara Phalg=\r\nuni. In SBC, it has vedha from Mercury and aspect from Moon and Mars. In D-=\r\n10, the 6th house from Cp containing Venus is Ge owned by Mercury and only =\r\nMercury aspects it.

From Dhanishtha containing Sun, the 10th star is Mrigasira.=\r\n In SBC, it has vedha from Mercury and aspect from Mars and Saturn. In D-10=\r\n, the 6th house from Ar containing Sun is Vi owned and occupied by Mercury =\r\nand only Mars aspects it from Pi. In rasi chart, Mercury and Mars are in GL=\r\n and Mars owns the 5th from GL.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; George W Bush&#39;s AmK is Jupiter.=\r\n From Chitra containing Jupiter, the 10th star is Sravana. In SBC, it has v=\r\nedha from none but aspected by Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. In D-10, the 6th=\r\n house from Cp containing Jupiter is Ge owned by Mercury and aspected by Ve=\r\nnus from Sg.

Please ignore my 2 cents=\r\n if this makes no sense to you.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I was quite passionate about Jy=\r\notish research several years back and used to spend a lot of time in resear=\r\nch. I used to sleep at 3 am and get up at 6 am. I used to spend long hours =\r\nformulating principles and testing them out on charts, changing JHora somet=\r\nimes for it. After coming home from work, I used to spend as much time on a=\r\nstrology study and research, as I used to spend on my main profession durin=\r\ng the day.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; After spiritual transformation in recent years, I st=\r\nopped spending that much time. However, the productivity of my Jyotish rese=\r\narch went up. Some ideas that struck to my mind at the end of nice meditati=\r\non sessions turned out to be good and simply worked in several charts that =\r\nI tried out later.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; If you surrender to god and rishis, you will=\r\n receive whatever knowledge you need for your activities in this life. Have=\r\n faith in god and rishis and surrender. Also, it is important to approach J=\r\nyotish knowledge with the spirit of a brahmana. Brahmana is one who cares a=\r\nbout nothing other than knowledge and liberation. Kshatriya is one who care=\r\ns about power, authority and control over others. Vaisya is one who cares a=\r\nbout money. Do not look at your Jyotish knowledge as a means to have some c=\r\nontrol or authority over people and do not feel proud of your knowledge, li=\r\nke a kshatriya. Also, do not look at your Jyotish knowledge as a means to g=\r\net money and try to increase your gains, like a vaishya. Be a true braahman=\r\na in the prusuit of Jyotish knowledge and surrender to god and rishis. Sky =\r\nis the limit for you then.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Of course, it is also possible then =\r\nthat you lose interest in Jyotish completely or partially and do not receiv=\r\ne any or much Jyotish knowledge. But so be it. As I said, you will receive =\r\n&quot;whatever knowledge *you need*&quot;. You don&#39;t know what you really need, but g=\r\nod does! Complete surrender means not asking for any specific thing and acc=\r\nepting whatever comes one&#39;s way!\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; * * *\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Reply to Mai=\r\nl 2 below:\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I am replying publicly while keeping your anonymity.=\r\n\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; 2. Yes, a blue light from a Shiva linga entered his mother whe=\r\nn she was pregnant with him. She also had darshan of many celestial beings =\r\non a regular basis during her pregnancy, which stopped after the delivery.\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Actually, Vishnu told his father in the dream at Gaya that you =\r\nrefer to, that *he himself* would come as a son.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; There are diff=\r\nerent indications, but what Ramakrishna himself declared should be the fina=\r\nl word.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; 4. When I meditate deeply after homam or in general, I =\r\nsometimes go into a nice spiritual state. Though there was some desire to f=\r\nind some principle based on abhisheka nakshatra *before* meditation started=\r\n, it completely vanished from my consciousness as meditation deepened and t=\r\nhe regular self-awareness vanished too. Then I was in a nice spiritual stat=\r\ne where the logical mind and intuitive mind were very very calm without muc=\r\nh mental activity. When I was coming back to a state of normal self-awarene=\r\nss from such a state, I just became aware of a thought. It felt like it was=\r\n someone&#39;s thought just flowing in the universe and I happened to be on the=\r\n same wavelength and was able to observe it.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I only said I pray=\r\ned to Parasara and this formula was given to me. I did not say who gave it =\r\nto me, because I do not know. But I express my gratitude to Parasara, as I =\r\nhad prayed to him before and then this thought came and moreover this princ=\r\niple is far more logical and far more accurate than anything I was able to =\r\nsynthesize using my rational and intuitive minds before. If one begged the =\r\nking for money and suddenly found a bag of gold coins thrown into one&#39;s bac=\r\nkyard by an unseen person, one will only thank the king. Especially if the =\r\ncoins seem to be made of real gold..\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; 5. I am glad you were thin=\r\nking along those lines! It shows you have some really good samskaras guidin=\r\ng your instincts. You can ask Agni to carry an oblation of ghee to various =\r\ndeities and rishis, without a separate invocation.. For example, if your go=\r\ntra is Goutama, you can offer an oblation in the fire while saying &quot;om gaut=\r\namaaya svaahaa. gautamaayedam na mama&quot;. Or, if you want to offer to Jupiter=\r\n, you can offer an oblation in the fire while saying &quot;om bR^ihaspataye svaa=\r\nhaa. bR^ihaspataya na mama&quot;. You can do this after the main homam and befor=\r\ne you start the final offerings to Agni, Vaayu, Surya, Prajapati, Vishnu an=\r\nd Shiva.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; If you want to specifically invoke, you can use the Ga=\r\nnesha invocation from Krishna homam or Shiva homam manual as the template a=\r\nnd follow that procedure. Replace &quot;oM gaM gaNapataye namaH&quot; with &quot;oM paM pa=\r\nraasharaaya namaH&quot; or just &quot;oM paraasharaaya namaH&quot; or the verse for Parasa=\r\nra below. Irresepctive of the exact procedure you used, the keys to success=\r\n are (a) the strength of belief that Parasara is there in fire and (b) resp=\r\nect and surrender for him. Use whatever procedure maximizes those aspects i=\r\nn you.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n  &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n  &gt; &gt; ------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n  &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n  &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n  &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n  &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro. home.comcast. net\n  &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org\n  &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://w=\r\nww.SriJagan nath.org\n  &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups .com, rajarshi nand=\r\ny &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Very good work.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; I was trying this in some charts and mos=\r\nt of them gave very accurate results.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a few queries:=\r\n\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) If both condition (a) and condition (b) get fulfilled, =\r\ncan we safely conclude that this person will attain to the highest spiritua=\r\nl experience of Moksha?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If only one condition is fulfill=\r\ned, say the Vedha graha aspects the 12th from Ak in D20, but is not connect=\r\ned to 5th and/or 9th in rasi, or vice versa, can we conclude that the perso=\r\nn is spiritual but may not reach the highest realization?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; 3=\r\n) In case of no Vedha graha, does it indicate that this person cannot attai=\r\nn moksha in that life time?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for your research.

He who was Rama and Krishna before is in this body now. And I do=\r\n not mean it in your vedantic sense!&quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; By explicitly saying =\r\nthat he did not mean it in the vedantic sense and referring to &quot;He who was =\r\nRama and Krishna before&quot;, he clearly revealed that he was an incarnation of=\r\n Lord Vishnu. Ramakrishna never spoke a lie and valued truthfulness highly.=\r\n The words of the realized man in question himself must be more reliable th=\r\nan questionable and unreliable astrological principles.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Mor=\r\neover, a couple of great religious authorities of the time studied Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa in his younger days when he was being trained by Bhairavi B=\r\nrahmani and saw all behavioral signs and physical marks that confirmed to t=\r\nhem that he was an incarnation of Vishnu. They declared him to be an incarn=\r\nation of Vishnu.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Given these two facts, your conclusion can=\r\nnot be correct.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda was inherently a jnaani. He rej=\r\nected Maayaa and even called Ramakrishna&#39; s visions of various deities as h=\r\nallucinations and plays of the mind. He only accepted the formless. Ramakri=\r\nshna slowly created in him respect and love for Vishnu Maayaa that governs =\r\nduality. Well, it takes one with purified Vishnu tattva to create respect a=\r\nnd love for Vishnu Maayaa in one with raw Shiva tattva. Moreover, it was at=\r\n the Shiva temple at Amarnath in Himalayas that Vivekananda finally realize=\r\nd his true nature.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; As Jupiter and Mer=\r\ncury are the natural guru and sishya and Jupiter is supposed to show Sadash=\r\niva and Mercury is supposed to show Vishnu, one may be tempted to theorize =\r\nthat Shiva is guru and Vishnu is sishya and attribute Shiva tattva to guru =\r\nin a guru-sishya pair. However, that is no logic. Jupiter is not just Sadas=\r\nhiva, he is Jagannath too. Some of Vishnu&#39;s avataras have been the greatest=\r\n gurus. Krishna is the ultimate jagadguru for his teaching of Bhagavad Gita=\r\n, the greatest spiritual teaching ever.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, take the exam=\r\nple of another illustrious guru-sishya pair from a few millennia back - Gov=\r\ninda Bhagavatpada and Aadi Shankara. Govinda Bhagavatpada was a highly lear=\r\nned and elevated master. He too had several great sishyas. His main sishya =\r\nAadi Shankara is considered an incarnation of Lord Shiva and Govinda Bhagav=\r\natpada is considered to be of Vishnu tattwa.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; If one says th=\r\nat Govinda Bhagavatpada must have had an amsha of Shiva (Jupiter) because h=\r\ne was the guru and that Aadi Shankara must have had an amsha of Vishnu (Mer=\r\ncury) because he was the sishya, that would be no logic at all! Shiva himse=\r\nlf said that he would be born as Aadi Shankara.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, g=\r\niven the parallels between the lives of Aadi Shankara and Vivekananda, it i=\r\ns possible that Vivekananda was a re-incarnation of Aadi Shankara.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Ab=\r\nhisheka Nakshatra Principle\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -\n  &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; You said in the same book that abhisheka nakshatra&#39;s lord (as p=\r\ner Vimsottari dasa lordship) being AK is the &quot;first indication of a high le=\r\nvel soul having incarnated&quot;. You use the charts of Ramakrishna and Vivekana=\r\nnda and a questionable chart of Lord Krishna to justify it.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n However, there are many exampsles like Sarada Mata, Ramana Maharshi, Swami=\r\n Chandrasekhara Saraswati, Srila Prabhupada and Swami Sivananda, which do n=\r\not satisfy the criterion. All of them are definitely &quot;high level souls havi=\r\nng incarnated&quot;.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, it is questionable to have such a=\r\nn important formula based on &quot;vimsottari lordships&quot;, which is just a star-p=\r\nlanet mapping for one specific dasa scheme among many, as taught by Parasar=\r\na. Secondly, the space of Vimsottari lord of abhisheka nakshtra contains ni=\r\nne planets, while the space of chara karakas contains eight planets. A form=\r\nula based on equating them is mixing up two unequal sets. That is illogical=\r\n. Moreover, this formula fails in many examples and works in just two (thir=\r\nd example is based on questionable data). Thus, it sounds like a formula co=\r\nnstructed based on an observation which was made based on just 2-3 charts.\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Any genuine formula should work in a far higher percentage =\r\nof applicable charts.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; I tried to find=\r\n some reasonable and logical criterion based on abhisheka nakshatra to find=\r\n initial indications of a potential for liberation, that works in all the c=\r\nharts I mentioned above. I was unsuccessful. Each formula works in some and=\r\n fails in some. The example charts I chose are all unquestionably very high=\r\n caliber spiritual people.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; After my failure, I bowed to Mah=\r\narshi Parasara after a daily Chandi homam and prayed to him to kindly show =\r\nme a criterion based on abhisheka nakshatra that works in a higher percenta=\r\nge of applicable charts. The formula that was given to me is this: &quot;The abh=\r\nisheka nakshatra - the 28th nakshatra - reckoned from chara aatma kaaraka h=\r\nas aspect or vedha in sarvatobhadra chakra (SBC) from a planet that is also=\r\n associated with (a) the 12th house from chara aatma kaaraka in D-20 chart =\r\nand (b) 5th or 9th house from lagna in rasi chart. If chara aatma kaaraka i=\r\ns Rahu, counting of the 28th star in SBC as well as counting of the 12th ho=\r\nuse in D-20 is in anti-zodiacal order.&quot;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; The D-20 is the cha=\r\nrt of spiritual progress. The 12th house from AK in it shows the liberation=\r\n of individual soul as one progresses spiritually. Similarly, SBC is the ch=\r\nakra in the nakshatra space and abhisheka (28th) nakshatra from AK in it sh=\r\nows liberation of soul in the nakshatra space. Planet having an influence o=\r\nn both the factors supports spiritual liberation. The 5th and 9th from lagn=\r\na show poorvapunya and bhagya. If the same planet influences all the three =\r\nfactors, that planet can suggest liberation. The reverse counting from Rahu=\r\n is because Rahu goes in reverse. Even when defining argala, Parasara asked=\r\n to reckon argalas and virodha argalas based on houses from Rahu and Ketu i=\r\nn anti-zodiacal order.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, we are finding a planetary inf=\r\nluence that brings poorvapunya and bhagya (5th and 9th) to this specific ex=\r\nistence (lagna) and promotes liberation (12th house/28th star) of individua=\r\nl soul (AK) in the conscious mental plane (SBC) and the plane of spiritual =\r\nactivity (D-20).\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that this formula does not use=\r\n Vimsottari dasa lordships. It uses nakshatra chakra (SBC) for nakshatras a=\r\nnd D-20 for rasis.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; When the formula c=\r\name to me, I tried it on the charts of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sarada Mata=\r\n, Swami Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswati, Srila=\r\n Prabhupada, Swami Sivananda. It worked in all the charts.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSarada Mata&#39;s AK is Moon. He is in Uttara Phalguni. The 28th star from him =\r\nis Poorva Phalguni.

He is in Krittika. The 28th star from him c=\r\nounted anti-zodiacally is Rohini. It has vedha in SBC only from Saturn. In =\r\nD-20, Rahu is in Cp and the 12th house counted anti-zodiacally is Aq. Satur=\r\nn owns it. In rasi, Saturn occupies the 9th house.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekana=\r\nnda&#39; s AK is Sun. He is in Uttarashadha. The 28t star from him is Poorvasha=\r\ndha.

Why should one =\r\nworship Ganesha or Rudra or Chandika or \nMahakala.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In fact can a=\r\nnybody actually worship any deity.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1. The fact=\r\n of the matter is that one&#39;s mind will be drawn to the worship \nof deities =\r\nwhich one has worshipped in past lives.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. But, whether one will=\r\n achive or not with that aspect of the divine is \nbased on &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np; a. What is the residue of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera \nba=\r\nsically is responsible for this.One in a million &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuals will&nbsp;achieve the burning of \nthe Karana S=\r\nhareera. But&nbsp;when this is being done, then every karma \ndone&nbsp;to t=\r\nhat person&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to his body or mind, good or=\r\n bad must have an \nalmost hundred times more intensity result, like for lik=\r\ne.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp; b. What is t=\r\nhe intensity of the desire of that person for the Divine \nBeloved?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which again boils down to the amount of \n=\r\nkarmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas, the=\r\n \nlesser the&nbsp; desire to actually perform any kind of worship.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;People talk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I find that it simply does not matter. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Every mantra =\r\nis a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So, when the mantr=\r\na is chanted, the rupa is forming.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Where is the rupa forming?&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In the physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So t=\r\nhe deity&nbsp;will actually occupy the person.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But when can this=\r\n&nbsp;happen?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Only when the body is dead. Not dead physically, b=\r\nut in a different \nsense.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;ie. ASANA: the mind forgets the body e=\r\nxists after a few hours of sitting \nreally still for a few hours a day.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and f=\r\neels it \nis alive, it tries to still the breath.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; Dhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the mind, \nremember the body is =\r\ndead for the mind at this stage.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dharana: The=\r\n mind percieves that form of God which is \nthe object of the consciousness,=\r\n but duality exists.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pratyahara: a phenomenon=\r\n where the eyes do not see, the \nears do not hear. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; Samadhi: the rupa is so well established, that the \nultimate form of=\r\n that rupa, that mantra, the Nirguna manifests.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;So the emptiness must come about in the mind and body about one&#39;s own \nid=\r\nentity before God fills it up with His form.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So, mantra is simpl=\r\ny a tool to make us realise God. Anybody can do mantras, \nbut most people&#39;s=\r\n internal fire or Agni is &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;not really charged up to digest these=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Japa is no doubt great, but it is involved with the purificati=\r\non of air, \nwhereas fire is involved in the purification of internal fire.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;When internal fire is purified, then the ability to visualise yo=\r\nur deity \nbecomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is easy and moreover, A=\r\ngni is a living \nGod, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen by your physical ey=\r\nes.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally when it d=\r\nies, it \ncontinues to&nbsp;live on within the sadhaka.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In Kali Y=\r\nuga, this ability to call a living God into the house is so \npowerful and s=\r\no exhalting that later on japa after homam&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;brings very fast resu=\r\nlts.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Why Ganesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in a=\r\nny case are not \ndestined to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way=\r\n they will pursue some \nsadhana is if they are given some material result q=\r\nuite quickly by their \nsadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Those who have problems in caree=\r\nr, litigation, problems with marriage or in \nfinding life partner, problems=\r\n with education or speech can really advance their \nmundane satisfaction wi=\r\nth Ganapati homa.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have seen this numerous times myself with pe=\r\nople who are in this movement \nand outside.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;That is not to say t=\r\nhat Ganapati can&#39;t give Mukti. The ultimate form of \nGanapati is the word o=\r\nf God.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And He is sakshama in giving Mukti as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The mahamantras are many and I agree that some may say that=\r\n lets do \nthis(mahamantras) first.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;BUT,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The Vedic mah=\r\namantras require the kind of intonation so perfect with \nvisualisation at d=\r\nifferent bits of the body with various syllables, that for \nmost people thi=\r\ns is not feasible, especially since their Sanskrit itself is \nsomewhat impe=\r\nrfect.(remember name is form, if name is not repeated properly then \nhow wi=\r\nll the form be?)(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati for rakshati \ni=\r\nn Pune many years ago).&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And then there are mahamantras which are=\r\n ok with almost any intonation. If \nsomeone wants to follow this that is al=\r\nso ok.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya=\r\n. Because, the \nentrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by Him.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Again some doubt comes into people&#39;s heads about some m=\r\nantras harming them \nwhen recited:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If somebody experiences bad t=\r\nhings when a mantra of a certain deity is \nrecited then all it means is tha=\r\nt the karmas of the Karana shareera are \nbeing&nbsp;dealt with(by the deity=\r\n)&nbsp;quite fast, so they have to be \nexperienced. It actually means that =\r\nthe Devata is close and more intense sadhana \nis needed. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Actually, all this business about mantra and mahamantra is imma=\r\nterial, \nAllah malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Us parvardigar se p=\r\nrarthana kar, woh sab raste khol deta hai.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With humility&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Manish&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;On Thu, Sep 17, 2009 at 4:49 A=\r\nM, pvr108 &lt;SPAN \ndir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;pvr@chart=\r\ner.net&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE class=3Dgmail_quote \nstyle=3D=\r\n&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 1ex; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n  &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;--- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;so=\r\nhamsa@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Sanjay \n  Rath&quot; &lt;sanjayrath@...&gt; wrote:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;o=E1=B9 &nbsp;gurave \n  nama=E1=B8=A5&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Nar=\r\nasi=E1=B9 ha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Before I venture on this ...is \n  this your opini=\r\non?

How=\r\never, looking at one&#39;s own knowledge as power, feeling \n  proud and wanting=\r\n to get some influence or authority over people using it is \n  kshatriya at=\r\ntitude. It does not lead to enlightenment. Such attitude restricts \n  the b=\r\nlooming of (and also the benefit to the world from) one&#39;s \n  knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One should humbly look at oneself as an instrument \n  of god a=\r\nnd operate guided by one&#39;s sense of dharma, without being sensitive to \n  w=\r\nhether others are praising or criticizing one. Swami Vivekananda famously \n=\r\n  said once that Ramakrishna could have created 100 Vivekanandas from sand =\r\nand \n  whatever he was and did was due to his guru&#39;s greatness. That is wha=\r\nt I mean \n  by humbly looking at oneself as an instrument. BTW, Swamiji was=\r\n not one to \n  show off fake humility. He spoke his mind frankly and always=\r\n stood up for what \n  he believed in, with unmatched honesty, integrity, co=\r\nnviction and \n  fearlessness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Surrender to god, ask for not=\r\nhing (including any \n  knowledge), be grateful for whatEVER He gives (inclu=\r\nding any knowledge) and do \n  what you see as your dharma with what he give=\r\ns you. THAT is the spirit of a \n  braahmana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Interestingly,=\r\n one with a pure braahmana attitude \n  automatically becomes powerful. One =\r\nwho wants power and control is upset when \n  that is undermined. One who wa=\r\nnts money and profits is upset when that is \n  underminded. How can anyone =\r\nupset one who wants nothing and does whatever one \n  *can* with whatever on=\r\ne *has*? Freedom from desires (including desires related \n  to knowledge) i=\r\ns the highest power.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In not-so-old days, \n  braahmanas roam=\r\ned this earth who very pure like fire, who had no desires and \n  who fulfil=\r\nled what they saw as their dharma without any expectations or \n  inhibition=\r\ns. No wonder such braahmanas exuded such power that the whole world \n  was =\r\nin awe of them and even mighty kings bowed before their \n  &quot;power&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Your mail has prompted me to delve into the \n  homan section =\r\nin you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; website and shortly I will start with the \n  homan with=\r\n the various&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; templates you have cited in your site. \n  PVRji, =\r\nwould you kindly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; advise us which homan to start with and \n  wh=\r\nat are the benefits&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one can get from the various homan&#39;s state=\r\nd \n  in your site.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (Thanks for your time and advises).&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Ganapathi homam is the best homam for anybody to start with. As=\r\n a spiritual \n  sadhana, it is a good idea to do Ganapathi homam for a few =\r\nmonths before \n  starting any other homam. Ganapathi controls the mooladhar=\r\na chakra, as well as \n  the the opening of the sushumna nadi. Thus, he prot=\r\nects one&#39;s material life \n  and enables spiritual progress. Moreover, Ganap=\r\nathi sadhana pleases Ketu and \n  that can help in one&#39;s astrology pursuits =\r\ntoo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My humble \n  prayers to our Creator to bless with=\r\n you with all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the knowledge \n  so that you can share it with u=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My humble prayers to the \n  Mother to create a bunch of p=\r\nurified Braahminical Jyotishis and bless them \n  with perfect knowledge so =\r\nthat the world re-awakens and sanatana dharma is \n  re-estalished firmly on=\r\n this earth..&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n =\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort \n  Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; \n  =\r\ntarget=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri \n=\r\n  Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n  =\r\ntarget=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spiritua=\r\nlity: \n  &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; \n  target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free \n  Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; \n  tar=\r\nget=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish \n =\r\n software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; \n  target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre \n=\r\n  (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; \n  target=3D_blan=\r\nk&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&gt;=\r\n --- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;sohamsa@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt; \n  &lt;mailto:&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa%2540yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;soha=\r\nmsa%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; \n  &nbsp;&lt;mailto:&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:soha=\r\nmsa%2540yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;sohamsa%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; , \n  Dev Sarkar =\r\n&lt;sarkar_dbx@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; PVRji \n  Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Your mail , reply, clarifications and the \n  write-up=\r\ns has been quite an enlightening experience for student of astrology \n  lik=\r\ne me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Explaining clearly the traits of Brahmana ,=\r\n \n  Kshatriya &amp; Vaisya at the context of learning &amp; sharing of know=\r\nledge \n  was very nicely said.
