He was the object-lesson of all the theoretical knowledge given in the =\r\nshastras. He showed by his life what the rishis and Avataras really wanted =\r\nto teach. The books were theories, he was the realization. This man had in =\r\nfifty-one years lived the five thousand years of national spiritual life, a=\r\nnd so raised him self to be an object-lesson for future generations. \n\n\n"}}
