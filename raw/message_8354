For=\r\n The Mother Durga, hatred is a boon IMHO.\n\nSo dont worry and keep going....=\r\nblame her, damn her, yell at her as much as you can and keep doing...you ar=\r\ne surely blessed if you really start hating her.\n\nI have a very humerous sh=\r\nort story in this regard which has a deep meaning.\n\nthere was a person in a=\r\n village who used to go to a Temple every morning without fail to praise th=\r\ne Lord and then go to his field for work. in the same village there was ano=\r\nther person who disliked and hated God so much that he also used to visit t=\r\nhe temple Lord every day morning without fail, to just yell at lord, abuse =\r\nthe deity.\n\nOne night, there was a thunderstorm with very hevay rain and in=\r\n the morning, there was waist deep water around temple and it was still rai=\r\nning heavily. The gentle man who liked God thought that It is very heavy ra=\r\nin and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn&#39;t go to temple on that=\r\n morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though could not st=\r\nop himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-s=\r\ntakingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing =\r\nthe deity.\n\nThe lord became very pleased with him and gave him Darshana.\n\n*=\r\n**\n\nAparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you. I know you dont mean wh=\r\nat you wrote and you actually have lot of love for Durga because such words=\r\n of Damn also come out when you love somebody very dearly in your heart os =\r\nhearts.\n\nThis is for the well meaning spiritual people who get hurt by some=\r\n other spiritual people&#39;s temperory disgust and outburst. \n \n\nBest Regards,=\r\n\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\nMai na Jaanu, Tu hi jaane....Tu hai meri, main to Tera....\n\n\n\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while\n&gt; re=\r\nading, time is running out, who knows when you will reach the\n&gt; cremation g=\r\nround, chant and chant.

Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo\n&gt; \n&gt; To Priyank  Maharaj,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; A little pointer,\n&gt; &quot;they do sadhana for all gods&quot;\n&gt; For all forms sou=\r\nnds better, and I always prefer to do for one form\n&gt; first, paagal kutton k=\r\ni tarah till that form runs after the devotee to\n&gt; perform worship because =\r\nnow he/she can&#39;t afford to be away from the\n&gt; devotee. It becomes a play, a=\r\n play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; understand.\n&gt; \n&gt; A little point a=\r\nbout love these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; the sun, was doin=\r\ng homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; open field with no s=\r\nhade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; was sweating profusel=\r\ny as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; sweat coming into his ey=\r\nes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; me to hide so that you a=\r\nre comfortable???\n&gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked him=\r\nself,\n&gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this very=\r\n\n&gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt;=\r\n All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; sun=\r\nbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; don=\r\n&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; look =\r\nat his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The man was=\r\n humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; because after all=\r\n, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &quot;shine on, I love =\r\n&quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; (That last line wa=\r\ns a joke.)\n&gt; \n&gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summ=\r\ners we hate\n&gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is =\r\nso\n&gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him\n&gt;=\r\n there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; =\r\nbreathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; exi=\r\nst, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; Hell, he bur=\r\nns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet what d=\r\no most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; births combin=\r\ned.\n&gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt;=\r\n there are quite a few.\n&gt; \n&gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she does=\r\nn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just be=\r\ncause she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What lov=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he =\r\nis in\n&gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarel=\r\ny met\n&gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to=\r\n\n&gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; =\r\ndon&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; =\r\nI asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; Well, h=\r\ne slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; mother will=\r\n decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; bata-oon ki m=\r\nujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; chahiye, apni =\r\nbhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; quite a lot of peop=\r\nle I have met.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are sure to=\r\n get the one you\n&gt; love????\n&gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours=\r\n, yeah right, another\n&gt; slap!!\n&gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s=\r\n sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but da=\r\nre I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will =\r\nbe delivered, but then\n&gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big =\r\nenough to know whats\n&gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who ja=\r\nane.  Rather my love\n&gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come a=\r\nnd tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (g=\r\nod) tells me first\n&gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i =\r\nalready have that\n&gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; To top it all he says si=\r\nnce he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; he say anything to his go=\r\nd? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; have surrendered, then it sh=\r\nould be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; mean you sit on your ass warming=\r\n it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai=\r\n bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; hui hai??\n&gt; \n&gt; Surrender is you do y=\r\nour duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; god&#39;s, the results are =\r\n&quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; If you actually manage to=\r\n surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; counselor, believe you me.=\r\n Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25=\r\n000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the greatest men, th=\r\ne greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog=\r\n. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; when he sees his master, that =\r\nis devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; master , to bring him chicken, o=\r\nr mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t =\r\nbring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants mas=\r\nter, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with g=\r\nod, and what do we do?????\n&gt; We are never happy with what the master brings=\r\n, because we were\n&gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n=\r\n&gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; \n&gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , =\r\nwe subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, =\r\nI never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; If you only want him,=\r\n why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; We are selfish dogs, al=\r\nways SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; that masterji brings us =\r\nthat bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; blanket, that milk, but we ra=\r\nrely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; wag at his thought. Tails of gr=\r\neat dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; about the great dogs, and pretend=\r\n that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, =\r\nits an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then=\r\n you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will =\r\nsalute you.
