It was amazing to me that =\r\nat this age, people are able to perform such miracles of offering themselve=\r\ns [their bodies] into the fire. I remember reading Vimalananda that fire ca=\r\nn be friendly to one if one starts worshipping with the right attitude. Thi=\r\ns only confirms that. I would like to hear your comments about the same, if=\r\n you had a chance to see those videos. \n\nAlso, according to our sastras, Sa=\r\nnyasis are not bound to fire-worship and hence they are buried after they l=\r\neave their mortal bodies, not cremated. Then how come this swamy is perform=\r\ning these elaborate homams? I am sure I have something lacking in my unders=\r\ntanding.\n\nCan women teachers hold the title Acharya? I heard the term achar=\r\nya only in case of men from our puranic literature. But these days I am hea=\r\nring the word Acharya in front of many Women teachers. Is that gramatically=\r\n correct or there is a different Sanskrit word for the same? \n\nWhat is your=\r\n opinion on Chinmaya Mission? They recently opened a chapter in our City an=\r\nd the organizers are trying to involve me in their activities. Before the C=\r\nhinmaya Mission, I had been teaching Bhagavadgita to a few children in the =\r\ncommunity and hence they want me take active role in teaching at the missio=\r\nn. I am not comfortable with some of the practises of the mission. They are=\r\n printing and distributing sacred mantras like Gayatri Mantra, Mrityunjaya =\r\nMantra and so on, which is not a right practise from the traditions that I =\r\nlearnt. I consider you as my Guru and hence I take your word as an approval=\r\n or disapproval for undertaking such committments. That apart, I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk I have evolved much to be teaching such great subjects. Even the Gita tha=\r\nt I am teaching to kids is somewhat superficial only as I am only ensuring =\r\nthat they are memorizing the whole text and emphasizing on the pronunciatio=\r\nn, without much attention to the meanings. Having learnt a lot of thyagaraj=\r\na krithis/dikshitar krithis/Nannayya and Pothanas literature, I think I hav=\r\ne a decent understanding of how to pronounce the sanskrit and telugu words =\r\nand hence is the direction of my emphasis. But teaching meanings (literal a=\r\nnd esoteric) is beyond my capacity, I feel. What do you want me to do in su=\r\nch a situation?\n\nRegards, \n\nNagraj\n\n\n"}}
