At the very \nleast, the veda mantra (ganaanaam tvaa) and beeja mantra (om sreem hreem \nkleem) are done. If you really want to do only one mantra, that is fine I \nsuppose.\n\nYou can look at it this way: When you do other homas, you first call Ganesha \nand offer his mantra and then do the main deity. When you do a homam for \nGanesha himself, you do not do that.\n\nIt is a good idea to do a small count of the two mantras atleast. After \ndoing them for a small count, the focus can be either atharva seersham or \nbeeja mantra or veda mantra.\n\nGanesha is the lord of Mooladhara chakra, the earthy plane of consciousness. \nDoing different mantras for Ganesha takes care of various aspects of it.\n\nAgain, if you want to do only one specific mantra, that is perfectly fine.\n\nNever worry about &quot;irritating&quot;.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, November 02, 2008 2:59 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: questions w.r.t.

Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (1) No. Any food offered as bali (as opposed to &quot;naivedyam&quot; to a\n&gt; deity) is\n&gt;&gt; usually not consumed. It is thrown away. If you live in woods,\n&gt; throw it away\n&gt;&gt; in the open so animals can eat it. Otheriwse, throw it in garbage.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On the other hand, &quot;naivedyam&quot; offered to god can be consumed by\n&gt; people as\n&gt;&gt; prasad.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (2) Either is fine. They symbolize the path of shakti moving from\n&gt; you to the\n&gt;&gt; fire and vice versa.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (3) Either is fine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas used in a pooja,\n&gt; everything\n&gt;&gt; has a purpose and it has to go when its purpose is served. That&#39;s\n&gt; the nature\n&gt;&gt; of life. While the flowers and akshatas are used in homam, they\n&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; sacrosanct and should be handled with care, love and respect.\n&gt; After they\n&gt;&gt; serve their purpose, they have to be disposed of however one can.\n&gt; Throwing\n&gt;&gt; in garbage is fine if you ask me. Another way is to collect them\n&gt; in a bag\n&gt;&gt; until you accumulate a good amount and burn them oneday. If you\n&gt; have a local\n&gt;&gt; temple, you can go and see if you can throw them wherever they\n&gt; throw the\n&gt;&gt; flowers etc they use at the temple.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ashes from the homam are considered sacred. They contain\n&gt; *some* of the\n&gt;&gt; energy generated from the homam. The best way to dispose the ashes\n&gt; is to\n&gt;&gt; throw them into a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean).\n&gt; This\n&gt;&gt; ensures that the energy is not localized to one place and is\n&gt; distributed\n&gt;&gt; back to the Nature. Another thing some people do is to dig a deep\n&gt; pit in the\n&gt;&gt; yard and bury the ashes. It restricts the energy to the place and\n&gt; not a\n&gt;&gt; great idea. Please remember that the energy in the ashes is only a\n&gt; *part* of\n&gt;&gt; the energy generated. Some energy is also within the person\n&gt; performing homam\n&gt;&gt; and helps to purify the person. Giving some part back to the\n&gt; nature is a\n&gt;&gt; very good idea.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 01, 2008 7:18 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] questions w.r.t.

If one\n&gt; takes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a Dray coconut Half and presses it by holding in both Palms,\n&gt; it&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; &gt; break in to 3 to 4 pieces. if required, one can further make one\n&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; two pieces from those again by breaking it by using palms. I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experinced that those pieces works out to be very useful (Size\n&gt; wise)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to sustain fire for long time hence one can concentrate more in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reciting Mantra then worrying about sustainance of fire. the\n&gt; another\n&gt;&gt; &gt; important advantage is that use of Knife can be completely\n&gt; avoided.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; just one input if it helps some..\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; utpal\n\n\n"}}
