Re-incarnation IS re=\r\nal, but identifying one&#39;s last incarnation is difficult. Sri KN Rao collect=\r\ned some data of young people whose past life recollections were independent=\r\nly verified by researchers. He provided the birthdata, deathdata and rebirt=\r\nhdata of some reliable case studies.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have done some work with it an=\r\nd am interested in all the data I can get hands on. So thanks for your data=\r\n. More than birthdata of the first life, I am interested in deathdata (date=\r\n, time and place of death). The last moment of life is an important one. It=\r\n gives clues to the last thought/desire, which is the foundation of the nex=\r\nt life. Moreover, death data is effectively birthdata of another existence,=\r\n which will end when conception for rebirth occurs. Thus, if death chart is=\r\n taken as the chart of an independent existence, rebirth (or rather concept=\r\nion for it) should show up as a major major event in annual/monthly charts =\r\nand transits. I have made some observations before, but more work is needed=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In any case, this topic better belongs to vedic-astrology list than=\r\n vedic-wisdom list.

She said, she was intrigued with a wierd, vivid, hypnogogic dream,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n she had had last night.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She saw herself sitting on the pulpit of =\r\na grave, in a grave yard, and read the\n&gt; &gt; following inscribed on the Cross=\r\n in French: EUGENIE ALEXANDRINE, DIED: ON\n&gt; &gt; SEPTEMBER 8TH 1969. She said =\r\nthat name was very familiar to her, though she had\n&gt; &gt; never heard of it. O=\r\nn an impulse I checked Wikipedia, and there was a report on\n&gt; &gt; Alexandra D=\r\navid-Neel (Eugenie Alexandrine)died on September 8th 1969. She is\n&gt; &gt; repor=\r\nted as a French Writer on Bhuddism, with more than 21 important works to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; her credit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My daughter was born on SEPTEMBER 8TH 1979. There is=\r\n ten years gap, but some\n&gt; &gt; connectivity seemed. Now she is a Dentist with=\r\n Academic distinctions in French\n&gt; &gt; language. She has submitted many resea=\r\nrch works. She is fond of Budhism to the\n&gt; &gt; extent of becoming a Budhist N=\r\nun. She has no inclination for marriage or\n&gt; &gt; motherhood. There is exact f=\r\nacial resemblance too. My daughter is very\n&gt; &gt; spiritual, so keen on women&#39;=\r\ns liberation, philonthropic, worried on social\n&gt; &gt; welfare of humanity.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Birth Data of Alexandra David-Neel from 10000 Famous Horoscopes of JH=\r\nora.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; D.B.
