The Major or rather THE MOST important thing i=\r\ns to know about &quot;Raama-&gt;baana&quot; (sure shot remedies) for these Ashta Pasha o=\r\nr Shadripu.\n\nAll these obstacles can be very subtle and many a times an asp=\r\nirant would not even notice their existence in his/her mind and when he/she=\r\n will notice that, it is even a bigger task to get rid of them.\n***\nWhen on=\r\ne does good to other(s), THE MOST difficult thing is to be free from &quot;THE e=\r\nxpectations&quot; of &quot;FAME or RESPECT or BOTH&quot;. that the other(s) would at least=\r\n talk good about the person and respect him/her. To remove such expectation=\r\ns also from one&#39;s mind is HIMALAYAN TASK. Hindi proverb which says &quot;Neki ka=\r\nr or Dariya me Daal&quot; is though very simple but very very very true and very=\r\n very very difficult to achieve.\n\nThe above example is not disconnected one=\r\n. It actually is the fitting example of subtle pride. The lurking Tiger.\n \n=\r\nSo coming back to my point, i would again say that what requires is the &quot;Ra=\r\nama Baana&quot;. And we or at least I have put my full faith (i do not know if m=\r\ny full faith is full enough) in Homam/Havan and i hope, deeply deeply hope =\r\nthat HOMAM/HAVAN is the Raam-baana of current age.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nUtpa=\r\nl\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; When young, Swami Adbhutananda (or rather Lat=\r\nu) was an orphan serving a \n&gt; rich man. When they visited Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa, he recognized the \n&gt; spiritual potential of the boy and asked the r=\r\nich man to leave the boy \n&gt; with him for he needed someone to serve him. He=\r\n then moulded the young \n&gt; boy into a spiritual giant.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was original=\r\nly uncultured and a bit impetuous with people that \n&gt; mis-treated Ramakrish=\r\nna in any way. With training and practice, he \n&gt; became a spiritual giant. =\r\nThere were times when he would profusely sweat \n&gt; while in deep meditation =\r\ninside the temple in sweltering heat and \n&gt; Ramakrishna would sit in front =\r\nof him and fan him to reduce the \n&gt; sweating! There was a time when he was =\r\nmeditating on a rock in the \n&gt; middle of water and fell inside water when a=\r\n big wave hit. He was so \n&gt; deeply in meditation that he did not get up and=\r\n remained still through \n&gt; all of this! Other disciples of Ramakrishna rush=\r\ned there and pulled him \n&gt; out. Ramakrishna used to praise his remarkable a=\r\nbility to lose himself \n&gt; in deep meditation!\n&gt; \n&gt; Though he was illiterate=\r\n and unable to write his own name, he understood \n&gt; the essence of Upanisha=\r\nds and spoke great spiritual truths that came \n&gt; through direct experience =\r\nand deep realization. He is the sishya who \n&gt; spent the most time listening=\r\n to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and observing \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda sa=\r\nid he was the biggest adbhuta (wonder/miracle) done \n&gt; by Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One who thinks that one is learned or=\r\n smart or pious and and has even a \n&gt; little bit of pride left will not mak=\r\ne much progress. One who does not \n&gt; have any pride, completely surrenders =\r\nand depends fully on god, will \n&gt; make faster progress.
