He is=\r\n a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing=\r\n disposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in =\r\nsimple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have =\r\nbeen exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdo=\r\nm. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nNo matter how much one has read, no matter how much one has understood, no =\r\nmatter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how many good karmas one ha=\r\ns done, no matter what spiritual experiences one had, no matter how blissfu=\r\nl one feels during meditation or most of the time, no matter how elevated o=\r\nne is spiritually, one can still fall. Take your mind off god for a second =\r\nand you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 2=\r\n4x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The most important thing is to surrender to Her (or=\r\n Him) and keep that attitude of a dedicated servant forever. There may be s=\r\nome members of this group who make good progress in the coming years and pe=\r\nople around them may start noticing their purity and treating them speciall=\r\ny. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, mo=\r\nney etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of eith=\r\ner adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride =\r\nto take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the=\r\n web of Mahamaya.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if a spiritual master=\r\n really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing=\r\n those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, we may still benefi=\r\nt. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky =\r\nis blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invalid if a person who =\r\ntaught them fell.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Perhaps an increase of dh=\r\narma is not possible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast=\r\n in key places. We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. He=\r\nr ways are definitely inscrutable.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ri=\r\ntual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- =\r\nkrishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Sri narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n For the last few days there are so many Sex scandals by the so called (fam=\r\nous and infamous) spiritual Guru&#39;s like Nithyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan et=\r\nc etc are being exposed to the masses. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Is there any relationship=\r\n with these incidents with the establishment of the Dharma as you keep sayi=\r\nng in the upcoming years?
