But whenever I do Chandipath, that day in general my ment=\r\nal state is pretty calm. However, it is a tough sadhana to do everyday. The=\r\n Path alone takes around an hour to recite, that too if you superfast, whic=\r\nh you are not supposed to, according to the book. If you recite at comforta=\r\nble speed, it takes around 1 hour 20 minutes just for the 13 chapters.

BUT=\r\n if ever you try out kriyas with Chandi or do the Chandipath to get xyz res=\r\nults in abc timeframe, (specially during complex forms of worship of Chandi=\r\n like those involving charnel grounds), then be sure that you know the prec=\r\nise and exact procedures. There are no half measures in those. Nishkama wor=\r\nship in complex methods is fine, but desire for material results without th=\r\ne knowledge of the procedures during complex rituals in begging for trouble=\r\n, whoever you might be. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Ami Jantra Tumi Jantri&lt;BR&gt;Ami Ghar Tumi Gharani&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Ami Ratha Tumi Rathi&lt;BR&gt;Jemon Chalao Temni Chali&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman=\r\n, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: time=\r\ns new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=\r\n=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/=\r\nB&gt; rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WE=\r\nIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Wednesday, 16 November 2011 11:09 P=\r\nM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Why Sapthshati mantras is called Siddha mantra?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV i=\r\nd=3Dyiv1794645011&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1794645011ygrp-te=\r\nxt&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can u pls elaborate about durga sapathshati,=\r\n its benefits, and uses in general man life, also if i have to start readin=\r\ng chapters menas increasing one by one so pls tell me imortance viz how sho=\r\nuld i increase&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1] 1 m fully comfortable in reading chap 11, now star=\r\nted reading 2, 4,5&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;regards&lt;BR&gt;Rakesh&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/us.mc829.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Priyank,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The docu=\r\nment refers to samputikaran mantras for the Chandi.

Siddha in the sense of bein=\r\ng &quot;accomplished for Self realization&quot; as well as &quot;siddhis&quot;, depending on th=\r\ne inclination and capacity of the sadhaka and of course Her will.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; To understand why it is so, one has to do sadhana and keep praying =\r\nto Her. Intellectual comprehension falls flat beyond a point. It is plain u=\r\nseless.=C3=82&nbsp;And the sadhana is not a one day/few months/one year or =\r\nfew years process.
