What =\r\nthey were doing in that line is better answered by your mind than by any ot=\r\nher person.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, however, Savikalpa samadhi, Nirvikalpa =\r\nsamadhi, Sahaja samadhi etc are not things you can obtain or buy, by standi=\r\nng in a line. Moreover, spiritual experiences never occur when one is expec=\r\nting or anticipating them. Various spiritual experiences occur when most th=\r\noughts cease in the mind and mind is focused on something specific, such as=\r\n a deity, a name, a mantra, a thought etc. The desire or pre-occupation\n wi=\r\nth a samadhi or a spiritual experience will often work as a barrier blockin=\r\ng one from good focus and concentration.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best\n regards,&lt;br&gt;Nar=\r\nasimha&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/=\r\nvedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/J=\r\nyotishWri tings&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 1/10/10, Laxmi Narayan &lt;i&gt;&l=\r\nt;shrijishrihari@ yahoo.co. uk&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;b=\r\norder-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishri=\r\nhari@ yahoo.co. uk&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject:\n [vedic-wisdom] Dream&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Sunday, January 10, 2010, 7:28 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div =\r\nid=3D&quot;yiv1290416232&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=\r\n=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; f=\r\nont-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-size-a=\r\ndjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nfamily: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Hel=\r\nlo,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few day=\r\ns ago I had a dream.
