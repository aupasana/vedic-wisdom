But they got lost whil=\r\ne trying to follow, because they could not see. People started arguing abou=\r\nt which way to go. Followers of the same open-eyed persons, after they left=\r\n the room, kept arguing which way the persons who left wanted them to follo=\r\nw. Being unable to see, they were all wrong in different ways of course.&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Instead of trying to open their eyes, they kept running here a=\r\nnd there with closed eyes and arguing with others on where to go. Some spen=\r\nt a lot of energy and time convincing others to walk along with them (conve=\r\nrsions) and felt proud of being part of big groups. Some called those\n who =\r\nwere going other ways and crossed their paths by bad names and even tried t=\r\no hurt them or even kill them.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;Pseudo-wisdom:&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Some people recognized that various people m=\r\nay have seen the same light though their descriptions were in different wor=\r\nds. They realized that everyone will and can see that same light if they op=\r\nened their eyes. They correctly recognized the closed eyes (conditioned ego=\r\nsense or I-ness) as the problem.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;But they grossly *underesti=\r\nmated* the difficulty in opening eyes after keeping them closed for too lon=\r\ng. They kept saying, &quot;you just open your eyes and then there will be brilli=\r\nant light&quot;. Some even *imagined* that their eyes were open and that they we=\r\nre seeing bright light.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Sadha=\r\nna:&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Some recognized the role of effort in opening eyes. They=\r\n kept trying to pull the eye lids apart consciously everyday (sadhana). Som=\r\ne of them had such wild imagination and anticipation of what they would see=\r\n when the eyes opened (experiences), that they were carried away by that an=\r\nd could not focus the energy on actually opening the eyes. Some of them end=\r\ned up imagining that they were seeing brilliant scenes that they had imagin=\r\ned earlier.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Some of them kept arguing about how to wash the =\r\nhands before trying to open eyelids and how to pull them, with what force, =\r\nin what angle etc etc (specifics &amp; procedures). Instead of pulling eyel=\r\nids apart however one can do it, they kept arguing about the best way to do=\r\n it and their eyes remained closed.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Some of them suceeded in=\r\n opening the eyes a little bit and the flash of brilliant light startled th=\r\nem. Having been in darkness for too long,\n they could not keep eyes open fo=\r\nr more than a split second. They closed eyes again, but became proud of the=\r\nir achievement. They assumed that the light could be seen only for a split =\r\nsecond by anyone and that they achieved what was there.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Of c=\r\nourse, some of them did not complicate things, did not get distracted and t=\r\nried sincerely using the best method they could think of and managed to ope=\r\nn eyes and see light.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Best regards,&lt;WBR&gt;Narasimha&lt;WBR&gt;------=\r\n--&lt;WBR&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedica=\r\nstrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/&lt;/A&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;--------&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(255,25=\r\n5,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1873340658-189621287-1344260363=:98559--\r\n\n"}}
