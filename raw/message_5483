My former company got others on my\nplace and I haven&#39;t felt good there also. So I quit there. Now there is\nhuge financial problem in my life in this period. Also in the field of\ninformatics I was working I felt it doesn&#39;t fulfill me enough. So the\nquestion is when will I find some suitable job in future and what kind of\ncarrier path is the most suitable for me?\nMy purpose is under question in this period and I do not know on which\npath to follow from here? (have a lot of different talents but haven&#39;t got\nthe best of any of them acting, singing, martial\narts,spokesperson,computers,sales...etc.)\nTo be precise I have with my family small private firm that sells\naluminium artifacts but that job also feels big crysis in last years.\n\nOther question considers my present girlfriend. I have a large wish to\nmarry her but the problems I spoke about make her I guess pretty insecure.\nThese days we had some disputes that made us counterparts. So will this\nrelationship last and will it lead to a more secure and stable place in\nthe future or will it end?\n\nMy D.O.B is 12.06.1978\n   T.O.B is 14:15 h\n   P.O.B is Kragujevac, Serbia\n\nIf some other data is needed please tell.\n\n\n"}}
