Do they work? I will give my 2 cents of vi=\r\news based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, straight-forward=\r\n and blunt.\n\n* * *\n\nThough believers call priests and get poojas done, in t=\r\nhe hope that their problems will be solved, many priests today are incapabl=\r\ne of producing any results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to a=\r\nccepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry thr=\r\noughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god and in r=\r\nemedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then talk about w=\r\nhat we should do.\n\nIn ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is=\r\n today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily inte=\r\nrested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primari=\r\nly interested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatr=\r\niya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily int=\r\nerested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with t=\r\nhe varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. H=\r\nowever, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s o=\r\nwn varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into =\r\na Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, fo=\r\nr example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.\n\nIn the ol=\r\nd days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested in knowledg=\r\ne and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence, money, plea=\r\nsures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated enough spiritua=\r\nl energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable of performi=\r\nng very effective poojas for people.\n\nToday, people who have spiritual pote=\r\nntial may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop fully=\r\n due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahmana families m=\r\nay also end up getting into modern careers and not developing fully as Brah=\r\nmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/S=\r\nhudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested in powe=\r\nr, authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. Those p=\r\nriests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brah=\r\nmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana =\r\nand accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.\n\n* * *\n\nIf on=\r\ne has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for t=\r\nhousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is=\r\n a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas do=\r\nne and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot b=\r\nring one any benefits.\n\nOne important note: The power is not in a combinati=\r\non of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The po=\r\nwer is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a=\r\n sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overc=\r\nomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different man=\r\ntras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy=\r\n, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. =\r\nFocus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casua=\r\nl practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense=\r\n sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the =\r\nhouses of people or in temples.\n\nI did see priests who have done good sadha=\r\nna, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are gett=\r\ning rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding =\r\nsuch a priest.\n\n* * *\n\nGiven this, one is better off not depending on the p=\r\nriest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against the &quot;Brahman=\r\na by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. =\r\nI have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class. My only w=\r\nish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into true Brahmana=\r\ns.\n\nInstead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and =\r\nthinking about money and possibly not identifying with your trouble, you ca=\r\nn do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification with the troub=\r\nle and your desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If =\r\nyou manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may a=\r\nctually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.\n\n* * *\n\nMany peopl=\r\ne think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a trained priest =\r\nshould do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite complicated ove=\r\nr the time too!\n\nHowever, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent=\r\n. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams =\r\nof protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to s=\r\nuch balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal =\r\nor will you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (=\r\nlentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.=\r\n\n\nSimilarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, yo=\r\nu need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with what you =\r\nknow. It will only give you energy.\n\n* * *\n\nThe fear to do rituals without =\r\n&quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be =\r\ndangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.=\r\n\n\nIt is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and get spec=\r\nific results. When used by someone with a high level of spiritual energy, s=\r\nome mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific powerful resul=\r\nts. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things in this age.\n=\r\n\nI will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack en=\r\nemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very =\r\ncareful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one s=\r\nhould hurt oneself by accident.\n\nHowever, suppose the house lord purposely =\r\nremoved ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick =\r\nand not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use th=\r\ne machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n\n&quot;Ammun=\r\nition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and rituals (m=\r\nachine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, one can=\r\n start using them right away.\n\nA lot of technicalities related to mantras a=\r\nnd rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up wit=\r\nh faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can rea=\r\nlistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on devot=\r\nion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion an=\r\nd focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come.\n\nGiven that =\r\nwe do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specific resul=\r\nts to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should just do the best =\r\njob we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and what result sh=\r\nould be given.\n\nBottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every si=\r\nncere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the other!!!\n\n*=\r\n * *\n\nDifferent mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different sha=\r\npes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you=\r\n use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start=\r\n begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years loo=\r\nking for the perfect begging bowl.\n\nInstead of waiting for astrologers with=\r\n half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ri=\r\ntual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respe=\r\nct) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vish=\r\nnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemar=\r\nupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, =\r\nVenkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chand=\r\nipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vy=\r\nasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotr=\r\na etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n\nDo not waste =\r\ntime looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhur=\r\nta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere heart.\n\nYour ef=\r\nfort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome your=\r\n situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.\n\n* * *\n\nI=\r\nn this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishi=\r\ns.\n\nFire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of =\r\nearth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes i=\r\nn contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire =\r\nis a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god =\r\nthrough fire purifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effecti=\r\nve than most other sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner =\r\npersonality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need not tak=\r\ne my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof=\r\n of the pudding is in eating it.\n\nVedic seers (rishis) performed homam regu=\r\nlarly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece=\r\n &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, fo=\r\nr guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended variou=\r\ns types of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope=\r\n. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to fo=\r\nllow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus=\r\n on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in ho=\r\nmam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people hav=\r\ne, that homam is not for Kali yuga.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna s=\r\naid, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Some=\r\n people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to hom=\r\na/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.\n\nIn the line just above that line,=\r\n Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. However, do we only me=\r\nditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?\n\nIf one sa=\r\nys that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing a mountain, it=\r\n does not mean that the process of climbing it using various kinds of gear =\r\nis useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinnacle. Most can=\r\nnot reach the pinnacle directly.\n\nSimilarly, Om is the supreme of all mantr=\r\nas being the source of all, but reaching the source may require using sever=\r\nal mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness =\r\nin the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require puri=\r\nfication and preparation by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yaj=\r\nna).\n\nWhen one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and=\r\n one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perf=\r\nectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one ma=\r\ny reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.\n\n=\r\n* * *\n\nDetailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types of =\r\nhomam by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use the =\r\nresources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by yourse=\r\nlf.\n\nNow *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves either dai=\r\nly or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.\n\nWhen Manish (my spiritua=\r\nl guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdo=\r\nm yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481)=\r\n told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi hom=\r\nam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplifie=\r\nd homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands =\r\nof people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping re=\r\nverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched t=\r\no my rational mind.\n\nHowever, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hund=\r\nreds of people are already performing regular homam. Though these are just =\r\nthe early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who n=\r\never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is =\r\na miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and =\r\nBrahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people doing homam for =\r\na couple of years are actually starting to experience things within and out=\r\nside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal transformation.\n\n*=\r\n * *\n\nI am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to =\r\nanyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know,=\r\n what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.\n\n=\r\nI want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who have even an i=\r\nota of interest to check out the homam website! If one gets into the habit =\r\nof performing homam regularly, it has the great potential to transform one&#39;=\r\ns life, materially and spiritually..\n\nHomam website:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/homam\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpa=\r\nna:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://Sar=\r\naswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJy=\r\notish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-949911297-1275994086=:59328\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;E=\r\nM&gt;Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowl=\r\nedge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual,&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is soo true!

As a result, Brahmana=\r\ns who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual =\r\nenergy are so few.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one has one million dollars in on=\r\ne&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. =\r\nIf one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given =\r\nby one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by\n a pr=\r\niest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nOne important note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)=\r\n or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that =\r\nFOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical ac=\r\ntions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wan=\r\nder and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the =\r\nfocus points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. =\r\nWithout it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot o=\r\nf practice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go =\r\nand do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought tha=\r\nt energy to the table when they did rituals at the houses of people or in t=\r\nemples.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purified thems=\r\nelves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are getting\n rarer and rar=\r\ner now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a priest.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given this, one is better off not depending on the priest=\r\n/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against the &quot;Brahmana by =\r\nbirth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. I hav=\r\ne neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class. My only wish i=\r\ns that more people - from any birth caste - develop into true Brahmanas.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and=\r\n thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your trouble, you c=\r\nan do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification with the trou=\r\nble and your desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If=\r\n you manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may =\r\nactually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious\n matter and only a t=\r\nrained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite c=\r\nomplicated over the time too!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, complexity of rituals should =\r\nnever be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories=\r\n everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you=\r\n have no access to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you f=\r\nind a balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just =\r\nhave a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atle=\r\nast get some energy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot;=\r\n to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. Yo=\r\nu can start with what you know. It will only give you energy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the no=\r\ntion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally=\r\n baseless, but it is irrelevant today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It\n is possible to focus the =\r\nmind on some mantras and rituals and get specific results. When used by som=\r\neone with a high level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may wo=\r\nrk very fast and give specific powerful results. However, Nature has purpos=\r\nely hidden (almost) such things in this age.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will give an analogy.=\r\n A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe to =\r\nuse, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs to le=\r\narn well, practice well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by ac=\r\ncident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammunition=\r\n from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky. Ins=\r\ntead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machine gun, jus=\r\nt take it and start beating your enemies with it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Ammunition&quot; has p=\r\nurposely been removed from most targeted mantras and rituals (machine guns)=\r\n in this age. Instead of waiting for\n perfect knowledge, one can start usin=\r\ng them right away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A lot of technicalities related to mantras and ri=\r\ntuals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up with fai=\r\nth, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can realisti=\r\ncally follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on devotion a=\r\nnd surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion and foc=\r\nus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given that=\r\n we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specific resu=\r\nlts to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should just do the best=\r\n job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and what result s=\r\nhould be given.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. E=\r\nvery sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the othe=\r\nr!!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different mantras and rituals are like begging bow=\r\nls of different shapes. They\n matter only so much. Depending on what kind o=\r\nf a begging bowl you use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it i=\r\ns important to start begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead o=\r\nf spending years looking for the perfect begging bowl.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of wa=\r\niting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell yo=\r\nu the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your g=\r\nuru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva=\r\n panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha=\r\n, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtaksh=\r\nari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, =\r\nhare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lali=\r\nta sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi =\r\nashtottarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for a=\r\nny purpose.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do\n not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation,=\r\n perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the oth=\r\ner with a sincere heart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your effort will not go waste. Your problem=\r\n may be solved or you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atl=\r\neast your focus will improve.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this context, I want t=\r\no say a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fire ritual is=\r\n found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and a=\r\nir, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. Th=\r\ne Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god th=\r\nat everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purif=\r\nies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other=\r\n sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and re=\r\nmoving material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for gra=\r\nnted. One can\n try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding i=\r\ns in eating it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for =\r\nthe benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Pa=\r\naraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance =\r\nto the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of =\r\nhomam as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, =\r\nmost remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatev=\r\ner procedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nit=\r\nty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasa=\r\nra&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that hom=\r\nam is not for Kali yuga.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna =\r\nsaid, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Som=\r\ne people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to\n h=\r\noma/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the line just above th=\r\nat line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. However, do we=\r\n only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing =\r\na mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using various =\r\nkinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinn=\r\nacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, Om is the =\r\nsupreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may=\r\n require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and abso=\r\nrbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but=\r\n it may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of =\r\nsacrifices (hama/yajna).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When one does homam or yajna, one is engagi=\r\nng in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi\n (absorbption i=\r\nn the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits stil=\r\nl and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, hom=\r\nam is far more effective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Detailed manuals giving short=\r\n procedures for doing various types of homam by oneself are available on th=\r\ne website given below. You can use the resources on that website to perform=\r\n several kinds of short homam by yourself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now *hundreds* of people =\r\nare performing homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are =\r\nalso doing monthly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-u=\r\np on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi=\r\n homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him\n to spread a simp=\r\nlified homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thous=\r\nands of people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helpi=\r\nng reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetc=\r\nhed to my rational mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s co=\r\nmmand, hundreds of people are already performing regular homam. Though thes=\r\ne are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are l=\r\naymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or rit=\r\nual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the =\r\nrishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people doing=\r\n homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience things wit=\r\nhin and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal transfo=\r\nrmation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I d=\r\no not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force\n anything on anyone. I just f=\r\nreely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The re=\r\nst is not in my hands.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly i=\r\nnvite those who have even an iota of interest to check out the homam websit=\r\ne! If one gets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the gre=\r\nat potential to transform one&#39;s life, materially and spiritually..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;H=\r\nomam website:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best =\r\nregards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\r\n--0-949911297-1275994086=:59328--\r\n\n"}}
