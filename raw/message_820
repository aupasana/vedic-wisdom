There was a \n&gt; discussion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between Kri=\r\nshna and Arjuna in a normal form and not in \n&gt; Sanskrit. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advised=\r\n Arjuna to start war after giving him the theory of \n&gt; Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vyasj=\r\ni just gave a poetic form in sanskrit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dr.Ashwin Rawal\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 23/12/08, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; =\r\n\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mahabhaarat is an epic or \nhistorical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rea=\r\nlity !!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesd=\r\nay, 23 December, 2008, 12:17 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu & Members,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere is a long pending question with me and that is \n&gt; Historical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nreality or otherwise of our many revered personalities/ \n&gt; events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take for instance, &#39;Mahabhaarat&#39; & &#39;Shri Krishna&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would try to give some view points gathered from all \nthese \n&gt; ye=\r\nars\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from various sources and my own thinking as well-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi didn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a \n&gt; reality.=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought that it was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to \nbe=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc.=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) How can parents name their children \n&gt; as &#39;DURYod=\r\nhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc.. i am not sure about the meaning of the na=\r\nmes but it \n&gt; implies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something perverted. knwoledgable person in=\r\n sanskrit can \n&gt; shed some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; light on this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) =\r\nMahabhaarat was a Grand Poem created by super-\nintelligent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; author,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; krsihna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was just a &#39;imaginary&#39; central character of his grand =\r\nwork.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; !.....!..... !\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Dr. Raman, =\r\nin Notable Horoscopes has strongly written \n&gt; that Shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna w=\r\nas a historically reality. His reasoning was that \nan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Imaginery =\r\ncreation* of some poet can never Inspire & \nattract\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; millions of p=\r\neople for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has w=\r\nritten imaginery story of \n&gt; Mahabhaarat to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic ge=\r\nnious then how come he himself \nfeatures \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; story?=\r\n if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but \nthen \n&gt; WHY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he=\r\n&#39;ll write another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. \n&gt; Bhaagavata. why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)=\r\n If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so many \n&gt; Saints of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can argue that becuase of their=\r\n intense worship of that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perticular Form, they could see the same=\r\n form of the \nsupreme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reality...the supreme power can take any fo=\r\nrm for the \nBhakta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is that, Paramhams=\r\na Yogananda \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devot=\r\nee of that \n&gt; form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, =\r\nwithout \ndevotion &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they got to see the form of Sh=\r\nri Krushna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any thought=\r\ns about this? How to conclusively establish the \n&gt; Truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; this case?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bring your gang together.
