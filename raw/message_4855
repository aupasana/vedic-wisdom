In  the old days, thi=\r\ns was the way it was done even in the kitchen. The agni used to cook food i=\r\ns also holy and some of the same rules apply.If you dont have a bamboo tube=\r\n, then you can get it from one of the people who make and sell ladders and =\r\nthe like( if you are in India). Not to disparage others, but some of the pr=\r\niests themselves are ignorant of all the things which needs to be observed =\r\nin a homa. As an example, for long homas one is allowed to drink water and =\r\nmilk in between- but no stimulants(coffee/tea being the most common).\n\nDear=\r\n Narasimha,\n            Namaste! What do the sastras say about what we shou=\r\nld do when we have to answer the call of nature during a homa ? For japa, t=\r\nhe rules are clear to me- do the same rules apply for homa ? If for example=\r\n we must get up and go for a &#39;long call&#39; and hence have to take bath- the f=\r\nire could go off- do we add more wood/cow dung/samit and go ? \n\nRegards,\n\nS=\r\n\n\np.s. My apologies-this question may seem trivial, but is very real..\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Shakti &lt;shakti.axapta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Man=\r\ny thanks for your valuable feedback and suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; i understand that=\r\n a blunder is committed during homam. i will again pray to\n&gt; sri mahalakshm=\r\ni devi to pardon my ignorance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Homam was performed with a specific san=\r\nkalpa asking Devi to nullify all the\n&gt; obstacles in my horoscope that are c=\r\nausing delay in my marriage and enable\n&gt; my grandparents to find a suitable=\r\n alliance for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my mind is strongly inclined in performing a blu=\r\nnder-free mahalakshmi\n&gt; homam in karthika month.i hope with the divine bels=\r\nsings of my guru , sri\n&gt; raghavendra swamy, i should be able to do it. If t=\r\nhere is any other\n&gt; auspicious day in the near furute for conducting a maha=\r\nlakshmi homam in the\n&gt; near future, please suggest us.\n&gt; \n&gt; i am sorry to s=\r\nay that most of the moderen day priests but not everyone are\n&gt; very commerc=\r\nial in nature.Its my practical experience with them.IMO, its ok\n&gt; if they d=\r\nemand more money from the clients but atleast they should try to\n&gt; justify =\r\nthe poeple who approach them.\n&gt; \n&gt; i am neither a brahmin nor my family has=\r\n ever condcuted these kind of\n&gt; religious rituals.so i dont know the Do-s a=\r\nnd Dont-s while performing a\n&gt; homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir, it would be more helpful if=\r\n you can publish a list of Homa instructions\n&gt; or &#39;things -to - remember wh=\r\nile performing homam&#39; (something like i was told\n&gt; to put the offerings in =\r\nthe fire without spilling it on the edges of the\n&gt; homakundam, having more =\r\nfore than smoke as you said below, etc), key\n&gt; ingredients of every homa,et=\r\nc or please point me to the material if its\n&gt; already existing somewhere so=\r\n that we can raise our voice when something\n&gt; during homam is getting devai=\r\nated from how it is intended to be done. Sorry\n&gt; if its too much of an ask.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, your selfless efforts in spreading the Homam significance for =\r\nthe\n&gt; benefit of entire universe is really appreciative and i sincerely wis=\r\nh that\n&gt; your teachings should reach every nook and corner of the world.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Hima Bindu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Sep 6, 2010 at 8:=\r\n25 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your gran=\r\ndmother is correct and her teaching is more applicable in the case\n&gt; &gt; of h=\r\noly homam fire. The priest you mentioned below simply showed poor\n&gt; &gt; judgm=\r\nent and understanding.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When one blows air into homa kundam directly=\r\n from mouth, small amounts of\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s saliva and one&#39;s germs get into hom=\r\na kundam. That is a very bad idea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When one must absolutely blow ai=\r\nr, Vimalananda suggests blowing through\n&gt; &gt; hand or some other object, i.e.=\r\n you blow onto your palm and the air reflects\n&gt; &gt; at a slight angle and goe=\r\ns into homa kundam. That is better.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I n=\r\never blow air. When fire is getting smaller, I offer ghee, sesame seeds\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n or wood to make it bigger. One need not wait so long that fire is about to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; extinguish. One should make it bigger earlier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ideally, there =\r\nshould be fire in a bigger part of homa kundam than smoke.\n&gt; &gt; If fire has =\r\ngone out in a bigger part of the homa kundam and there is smoke\n&gt; &gt; and if =\r\nfire is present in a smaller part of homa kundam, that is\n&gt; &gt; inauspicious =\r\nand ineffective. Lord Vishnu specifically taught that homam\n&gt; &gt; should be d=\r\none with more fire in homa kundam than smoke.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus, the habit of wa=\r\niting till fire becomes so small that it comes close\n&gt; &gt; to extinguishing, =\r\nis a bad one to start with. One should maintain a bigger\n&gt; &gt; fire always.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When a sadhaka with a very thin kaarmik =\r\npipeline does something, the result\n&gt; &gt; is seen very soon. So, if one start=\r\ns a wrong practice, one will see the\n&gt; &gt; result soon and learn one&#39;s lesson=\r\n. When someone with a very deep kaarmik\n&gt; &gt; pipeline starts engaging in a w=\r\nrong practice, the result may be seen much\n&gt; &gt; much later. By that time, on=\r\ne may have done that wrong thing too many times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, p=\r\nriests used to do intense sadhana and burn their karmas.\n&gt; &gt; Even if they d=\r\nid something wrong, they would quickly figure it out and\n&gt; &gt; correct themse=\r\nlves. Many priests of today have very deep kaarmik pipelines,\n&gt; &gt; do not do=\r\n much sadhana and the Nature&#39;s feedback system is broken.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When a priest or someone respectable does something inco=\r\nrrect, one can\n&gt; &gt; speak out if one thinks there is a reasonable chance of =\r\nbenefit from\n&gt; &gt; speaking out. Some priests are open-minded and understandi=\r\nng, but some are\n&gt; &gt; egoistic and they do not want to be corrected by layme=\r\nn. If one questions a\n&gt; &gt; priest and the priest becomes angry, can one rema=\r\nin calm or will one start\n&gt; &gt; to feel guilty or scared? If so, one should n=\r\not question. One should not do\n&gt; &gt; something, unless one is prepared for th=\r\ne consequences.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                 =\r\n   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n  Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatif=\r\nilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- pinky s &lt;shakti.axapta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Respected sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With the inspriration of &quot;Do Homam Yourself&quot; fro=\r\nm Pujya Sri PVR Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rao garu, i thought it would be a gud idea =\r\nto perform mahalakshmi homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during sravana month friday and approach=\r\ned a brahmin priest for the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lotus flowers dipped in honey=\r\n, Bilva fruits, Bilva leaves and other\n&gt; &gt; flowers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were offered durin=\r\ng the homa with 16 times recital of Srisuktham. With\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; virtue o=\r\nf knowledge gained from your previous posts, which essentially\n&gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that any sattvic material can be offered to gods in the homam fire, i\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; took a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spritual experience. i felt that i gained a lot of positive=\r\n energy from\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. i strongly felt that my offerings reached=\r\n mahalakshmi devi\n&gt; &gt; directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through the homakunda. Such is the imp=\r\nact of your teaching about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam-significance on me! Thank you, sir.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest&#39;s actio=\r\nn during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. When the homam fire was weakened and about to extingu=\r\nish, the\n&gt; &gt; priest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has blown air through his mouth directly into teh=\r\n homa kundam to increase\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the intensity of flames in it :(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i hav=\r\ne heard from my grandmother that blowing air through mouth into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fla=\r\nme/fire is equal to spitting on it and its a very unholy act. Since\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles t=\r\noo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that =\r\nmy &#39;fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledge may n=\r\not be\n&gt; &gt; relevant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the homam fire and i should not interfere with=\r\n the priest,who seemed\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be well experienced in performing homam=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PLease comment something about this and enlighten us with yo=\r\nur knowledge\n&gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that i will be careful from next time.
