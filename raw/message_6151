It is the nature of Kali=\r\n yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is my feeling that many people, inclu=\r\nding highly learned Vedic scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantr=\r\nas (including Veda mantras) incorrectly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, pronunciation is =\r\nnot everything. Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even =\r\nmore important. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct=\r\n pronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a =\r\nVeda mantra can stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. I=\r\nn fact, we have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, b=\r\nut very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Over the next few=\r\n months, I will write my views on correct pronunciation and point out some =\r\ncommon errors. If you do not think that correct pronunciation is important =\r\nor if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want t=\r\no change your pronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On =\r\nthe other hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give=\r\n a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appr=\r\nopriate.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of t=\r\nhe words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most prie=\r\nsts and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to somet=\r\nhing like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corrup=\r\ntion came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In &quot;pra=\r\nchodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you change =\r\nit into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, it becomes =\r\ntwo aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chhandas a=\r\nnd changes the meaning also. You may still experience something when medita=\r\nting on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the fullest=\r\n with that pronunciation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras)=\r\n are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant wi=\r\nthout a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an aksh=\r\nara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding a=\r\nny sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot deci=\r\npher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In &quot;prachoday=\r\naat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by i=\r\ntself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as it=\r\ns praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is consider=\r\ned one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is diffic=\r\nult for the listener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or =\r\n&quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. T=\r\nhe &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana=\r\n. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This makes people add some vowel to it=\r\n (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) =\r\nso that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenl=\r\ny becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Probably, some big tea=\r\ncher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of its=\r\nelf and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students would not get conf=\r\nused when learning. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (i=\r\nnstead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that be=\r\ncame a standard practice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you pronounc=\r\ne the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot;=\r\n at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an=\r\n vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prach=\r\nodayaat&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; What I said about words ending in=\r\n consonants applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more =\r\ncommonly encountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. T=\r\nhere also, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end=\r\n up changing the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. Th=\r\nat is also wrong.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One more common mistake i=\r\ns the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce =\r\nthis as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the=\r\n symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle i=\r\ns different. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this so=\r\nund because of their inability to see the dot and others started following.=\r\n Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly=\r\n will be the odd person out.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have t=\r\nwo different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds for the sam=\r\ne symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are di=\r\nfferent too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) w=\r\nith a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt;  \n&gt; In th=\r\ne sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturv=\r\nidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas=\r\n (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work an=\r\nd money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. M=\r\nost people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha ka=\r\nama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham=\r\n&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pron=\r\nunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by=\r\n many many trained priests!\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika=\r\n mantras, pay attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn=\r\n to pronounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, =\r\npay extra attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) co=\r\nmmonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will=\r\n be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mother al=\r\nlows me to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into =\r\nconsideration in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If =\r\nyou don&#39;t find any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught =\r\nby your gurus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s p=\r\nronunciation. But, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the wo=\r\nrld, I am guessing that there are SOME who are destined to change their pro=\r\nnunciation based on my views. That is why I am writing these mails.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I=\r\nf you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot!\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
