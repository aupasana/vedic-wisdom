This avathara took place during Treta Yuga befor=\r\ne Sri\nParashurama\n&gt; Avathara. Lord Maha Vishnu took this avathara in order =\r\nto suppress the\n&gt; arrogance, vanity and pride of Emperor Bali (Bali Chakrav=\r\narthi) and to\n&gt; restore the glory, power and authority of Lord Indra over t=\r\nhe Heaven\nwho had\n&gt; lost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to King Bali. Sri V=\r\nishnu Sahasra\nNama\n&gt; Sthothra describes in sloka # 17 and 56, the Lord asUp=\r\nendro Vaamanah\nand\n&gt; Trivikramah. *\n&gt; *Lord in this avathara was known as V=\r\namana because he was dwarf in\nform at\n&gt; the beginning. He was known as Triv=\r\nikrama because he is the one who\nhas\n&gt; conquered the three worlds, Earth, U=\r\npper worlds and Nether worlds. He\ngrew\n&gt; to a gigantic size while suppressi=\r\nng the King Bali and conquered the\n&gt; Universe with just three paces of his =\r\nfoot. He was also referred as\nUpendra\n&gt; as he was known to be the younger b=\r\nrother of Indra. We find all the\nthree\n&gt; names Trivikrama, Vamana and Upend=\r\nra while reciting 24 Kesava Namas.\nAn\n&gt; exclusive Purana named after Lord V=\r\namana called Sri Vamana Purana\nscripted\n&gt; by Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms=\r\n part of 18 great Puranas called\nAshtadasa\n&gt; Puranas.*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Lord Vamana was=\r\n born as the son of Sage Kashyapa (Kashyapa\nPrajapathi) and\n&gt; his wife Adit=\r\ni in accordance to the penance done by the couple and\nprayers\n&gt; of Indra an=\r\nd other Deities. He was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi\nday\n&gt; under the st=\r\nar constellation of Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year\nis\n&gt; celebrated =\r\nas Vamana Jayanthi the day on which Lord Sri Vamana was\nborn. As\n&gt; soon as =\r\nhe was born He took no time in attaining the boyhood becoming\na Vatu\n&gt; (Bra=\r\nhmachari) . Lord Brahma himself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to\nSri\n&gt; Vam=\r\nana. His attire was that of a typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing\na\n&gt; Koup=\r\neena (Loin cloth), a sacred thread, holding a Chatthra (Umbrella)\nin one\n&gt; =\r\nhand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick and water jug) in the other, his\nupper bod=\r\ny\n&gt; covered with Deer skin, wearing a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his\nt=\r\nhird\n&gt; finger.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Significance of Three Steps*\n&gt; *Lord Vamana went =\r\nto King Maha Bali and asks for three steps of land\n&gt; measured by his foot a=\r\ns charity. Initially Bali hesitated to donate\njust\n&gt; three paces of land as=\r\n it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty\nto give\n&gt; such charity. But =\r\nlater agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and\npromised\n&gt; to give three pa=\r\nces of land as charity measured by Sri Vamana&#39;s\nfoot. When\n&gt; Maha Bali comp=\r\nleted the ritual process of donating the land, Lord\nVamana\n&gt; assumed his co=\r\nsmic form (Trivikrama) , measured the entire Earth\nincluding\n&gt; the nether w=\r\norlds by his first step.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; With his second step He measured the entire=\r\n upper worlds. When his\nfoot\n&gt; reached the zenith it crossed the Sathya Lok=\r\na where Lord Brahma stays.\n&gt; Seeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu, Lord Brah=\r\nma offered abhishekam\nand\n&gt; washed the Lord&#39;s foot and the water that fell =\r\nfrom His foot\nsanctified the\n&gt; entire Universe. We find in the verses of gr=\r\neat composer and Saint Sri\n&gt; Annamacharya referring to the foot washed by L=\r\nord Brahma (Brahma\nKadigina\n&gt; Padamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri Venk=\r\nateswara. *\n&gt; *\n&gt; When the entire Universe was conquered by just two paces =\r\nof Lord Sri\nMaha\n&gt; Vishnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Universe =\r\nto keep\nVamana&#39;s\n&gt; third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space t=\r\no keep his\nthird\n&gt; pace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had vanished=\r\n and he had no\n&gt; hesitation in surrendering before the Supreme Lord. Having=\r\n realised\nthe\n&gt; Supreme Reality, Bali readily offered his own head to keep =\r\nthe\nLord&#39;s third\n&gt; step. Lord Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his=\r\n foot) on the\nhead\n&gt; of Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the ah=\r\nankara (egoism)\nof\n&gt; Maha Bali was suppressed and Indra was restored with h=\r\nis kingdom.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Uniqueness*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Av=\r\nathara where Lord Sri Maha Vishnu\ntook\n&gt; complete human form though dwarf a=\r\nt the beginning. The uniqueness of\nthis\n&gt; Avathara is that the Lord did not=\r\n use any weapon. The only weapon he\nused\n&gt; was that of begging in front of =\r\nKing Bali in accordance to the\nBrahmanic\n&gt; (Brahmachari) form he had attain=\r\ned. The Lord did not kill the King\nBali even\n&gt; though he was an Asura. He c=\r\nonquered him in a Vedic way with his\n&gt; intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas=\r\n, Vamana Avathara was a Sattvik\n&gt; Avathara. Lord had to resort to this stra=\r\ntegy due to the promise he\nhad made\n&gt; to his beloved devotee Prahlada not t=\r\no kill any of his descendants.\n&gt; Astrologically Jupiter (Guru) is said to b=\r\ne the Paramatma Amsa of\nVamana\n&gt; Avathara.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; *Message from Vamana Ava=\r\nthara\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt; *Hidden behind every Avathara of Paramatma there is a message=\r\n/moral\n&gt; conveyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the message is total surrend=\r\ner\nto the\n&gt; God however mighty one may be. When once you shed your ego and\n=\r\nsurrender\n&gt; totally with devotion at the feet of the supreme Lord there is =\r\nnothing\none\n&gt; can worry about and will get total protection. This is what e=\r\nxactly\nhas\n&gt; happened in case of Bali who had no other alternative but to s=\r\nurrender\nto\n&gt; the Lord Trivikrama who had conquered the three worlds.*\n&gt; *W=\r\nhen King Bali surrendered in front of Lord Vamana with total\ndevotion, the\n=\r\n&gt; Lord was very much pleased and gave him boons voluntarily without\nbeing\n&gt;=\r\n asked by King Bali. He not only made him the ruler of the nether world\n&gt; S=\r\nuthala but also assured him that He would always protect his kingdom.\nHe\n&gt; =\r\nalso assured Bali that he would become the Indra in the next\nManvanthara. B=\r\ny\n&gt; the touch of Lord&#39;s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got\nclea=\r\nned\n&gt; up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi) . This is what one should\nunders=\r\ntand\n&gt; that we should never ask for alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask yo=\r\nu\nwill\n&gt; get only what you had asked. It you don&#39;t ask you will get\neveryth=\r\ning that\n&gt; you require.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; The story of Bali also bring out the reality=\r\n that, there is nothing\n&gt; permanent and nothing to be taken for granted in =\r\nthis world be it\nwealth,\n&gt; beauty, power, status, position or family and no=\r\nthing belongs to\nanyone.\n&gt; Even the mighty have to fall on one day or the o=\r\nther. We have several\nsuch\n&gt; historical examples that we are also seeing in=\r\n this modern world.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Festivals related to Vamana Avathara:\n&gt; *\n&gt; =\r\n*The day on which Lord Vamana was born is celebrated every year on\n&gt; Bhadra=\r\npada Sukla Dwadasi Day as Vamana Jayanthi.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Temples of Vamana Ava=\r\nthara: Some of the famous temples of Lord Vamana\nare,\n&gt; *\n&gt; *Ulagalanda Per=\r\numal temple: It is a temple of Lord Sri Maha Vishnu in\n&gt; Trivikrama roopa (=\r\nVamana Avathara).

He was known as =\r\nTrivikrama because he is the one who&lt;BR&gt;has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conquered the three wor=\r\nlds, Earth, Upper worlds and Nether worlds. He&lt;BR&gt;grew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to a giganti=\r\nc size while suppressing the King Bali and conquered the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Universe w=\r\nith just three paces of his foot. He was also referred as&lt;BR&gt;Upendra&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; as he was known to be the younger brother of Indra. We find all the&lt;BR&gt;th=\r\nree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; names Trivikrama, Vamana and Upendra while reciting 24 Kesava N=\r\namas.&lt;BR&gt;An&lt;BR&gt;&gt; exclusive Purana named after Lord Vamana called Sri Vam=\r\nana Purana&lt;BR&gt;scripted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; by Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms part of 18=\r\n great Puranas called&lt;BR&gt;Ashtadasa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Puranas.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Lord =\r\nVamana was born as the son of Sage\n Kashyapa (Kashyapa&lt;BR&gt;Prajapathi) and&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; his wife Aditi in accordance to the penance done by the couple and&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;prayers&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Indra and other Deities. He was born on Bhadrapada Suk=\r\nla Dwadasi&lt;BR&gt;day&lt;BR&gt;&gt; under the star constellation of Sravana Nakshatra=\r\n. This day every year&lt;BR&gt;is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; celebrated as Vamana Jayanthi the day o=\r\nn which Lord Sri Vamana was&lt;BR&gt;born. As&lt;BR&gt;&gt; soon as he was born He took=\r\n no time in attaining the boyhood becoming&lt;BR&gt;a Vatu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (Brahmachari) =\r\n. Lord Brahma himself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to&lt;BR&gt;Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vama=\r\nna. His attire was that of a typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing&lt;BR&gt;a&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Koupeena (Loin cloth), a sacred thread, holding a Chatthra (Umbrella)&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;in one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick and water jug) in the oth=\r\ner, his&lt;BR&gt;upper body&lt;BR&gt;&gt; covered with Deer skin, wearing a ring of Dha=\r\nrbha (Kusa grass) to his&lt;BR&gt;third&lt;BR&gt;&gt; finger.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; **&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; *Significance of Three\n Steps*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Lord Vamana went to King Maha Ba=\r\nli and asks for three steps of land&lt;BR&gt;&gt; measured by his foot as charity=\r\n. Initially Bali hesitated to donate&lt;BR&gt;just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; three paces of land as=\r\n it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty&lt;BR&gt;to give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; such char=\r\nity. But later agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and&lt;BR&gt;promised&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; to give three paces of land as charity measured by Sri Vamana&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;foot. =\r\nWhen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maha Bali completed the ritual process of donating the land, L=\r\nord&lt;BR&gt;Vamana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; assumed his cosmic form (Trivikrama) , measured the e=\r\nntire Earth&lt;BR&gt;including&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the nether worlds by his first step.*&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With his second step He measured the entire upper worlds. Whe=\r\nn his&lt;BR&gt;foot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reached the zenith it crossed the Sathya Loka where L=\r\nord Brahma stays.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu, Lord Brahma =\r\noffered abhishekam&lt;BR&gt;and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; washed the Lord&#39;s foot and the water that=\r\n fell from His\n foot&lt;BR&gt;sanctified the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entire Universe. We find in =\r\nthe verses of great composer and Saint Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Annamacharya referring t=\r\no the foot washed by Lord Brahma (Brahma&lt;BR&gt;Kadigina&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Padamu) in one=\r\n of his verses on Lord Sri Venkateswara. *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When the entir=\r\ne Universe was conquered by just two paces of Lord Sri&lt;BR&gt;Maha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vish=\r\nnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Universe to keep&lt;BR&gt;Vamana&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space to keep his&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthird&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had vanished and =\r\nhe had no&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hesitation in surrendering before the Supreme Lord. Havin=\r\ng realised&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Supreme Reality, Bali readily offered his own hea=\r\nd to keep the&lt;BR&gt;Lord&#39;s third&lt;BR&gt;&gt; step. Lord Vamana immediately placed =\r\nhis third pace (his foot) on the&lt;BR&gt;head&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Bali and sent him to th=\r\ne nether worlds. Thus the ahankara (egoism)&lt;BR&gt;of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maha Bali was sup=\r\npressed\n and Indra was restored with his kingdom.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; **&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; *Uniqueness*&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Avathara =\r\nwhere Lord Sri Maha Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; complete human form though dwarf=\r\n at the beginning. The uniqueness of&lt;BR&gt;this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Avathara is that the L=\r\nord did not use any weapon. The only weapon he&lt;BR&gt;used&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was that of =\r\nbegging in front of King Bali in accordance to the&lt;BR&gt;Brahmanic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (Br=\r\nahmachari) form he had attained. The Lord did not kill the King&lt;BR&gt;Bali eve=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;&gt; though he was an Asura. He conquered him in a Vedic way with his&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana Avathara was a Sattvik=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Avathara. Lord had to resort to this strategy due to the promise h=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;had made&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to his beloved devotee Prahlada not to kill any of hi=\r\ns descendants.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astrologically Jupiter (Guru) is said to be the Para=\r\nmatma Amsa of&lt;BR&gt;Vamana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Avathara.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; **&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Message from=\r\n\n Vamana Avathara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Hidden behind every Avathara o=\r\nf Paramatma there is a message/moral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conveyed. In this Sri Vamana A=\r\nvathara the message is total surrender&lt;BR&gt;to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; God however mighty=\r\n one may be. When once you shed your ego and&lt;BR&gt;surrender&lt;BR&gt;&gt; totally w=\r\nith devotion at the feet of the supreme Lord there is nothing&lt;BR&gt;one&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; can worry about and will get total protection. This is what exactly&lt;BR&gt;ha=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happened in case of Bali who had no other alternative but to surr=\r\nender&lt;BR&gt;to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Lord Trivikrama who had conquered the three worlds.=\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *When King Bali surrendered in front of Lord Vamana with total&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;devotion, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lord was very much pleased and gave him boons volunt=\r\narily without&lt;BR&gt;being&lt;BR&gt;&gt; asked by King Bali. He not only made him the=\r\n ruler of the nether world&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suthala but also assured him that He wou=\r\nld always protect his kingdom.&lt;BR&gt;He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; also assured Bali that\n he wou=\r\nld become the Indra in the next&lt;BR&gt;Manvanthara. By&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the touch of Lor=\r\nd&#39;s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got&lt;BR&gt;cleaned&lt;BR&gt;&gt; up, h=\r\ne became immortal (Chiranjeevi) . This is what one should&lt;BR&gt;understand&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; that we should never ask for alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask you&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get only what you had asked. It you don&#39;t ask you will get&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;everything that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you require.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The story of Bal=\r\ni also bring out the reality that, there is nothing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; permanent and n=\r\nothing to be taken for granted in this world be it&lt;BR&gt;wealth,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beaut=\r\ny, power, status, position or family and nothing belongs to&lt;BR&gt;anyone.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Even the mighty have to fall on one day or the other. We have several&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;such&lt;BR&gt;&gt; historical examples that we are also seeing in this modern w=\r\norld.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; **&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Festivals related to Vamana Avathara:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *The day on which Lord Vamana was born is\n celebrated every=\r\n year on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi Day as Vamana Jayanthi.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n**&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Temples of Vamana Avathara: Some of the famous temples =\r\nof Lord Vamana&lt;BR&gt;are,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Ulagalanda Perumal temple: It is =\r\na temple of Lord Sri Maha Vishnu in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Trivikrama roopa (Vamana Avatha=\r\nra).
