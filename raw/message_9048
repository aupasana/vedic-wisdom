It is just A SMALL STEP in=\r\n overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Let me give an analogy=\r\n. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this body-mind co=\r\nmplex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over=\r\n time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionall=\r\ny goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of=\r\n body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it=\r\n comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it=\r\n. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any=\r\n out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s=\r\n words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without =\r\nwanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply de=\r\nsired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. A=\r\ns a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironi=\r\ncally may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;As you do=\r\n sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a delay me=\r\nchanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can=\r\n give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature som=\r\netimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want som=\r\nething else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life an=\r\nd be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that =\r\nwealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be v=\r\nery healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another case, one may =\r\ndeeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn as a tiger or a do=\r\ng and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that experience. Basically=\r\n, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; some=\r\nthing they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one=\r\n deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and o=\r\nne&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be =\r\nborn in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there =\r\nis enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Kundali=\r\nni rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in ter=\r\nms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mo=\r\nuse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake v=\r\niolently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared tha=\r\nt I would kill it!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse t=\r\nrap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certai=\r\nn slow death!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body=\r\n-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras=\r\n say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping o=\r\nut of this body-mind complex, without being scared?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, =\r\nis far better than Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable condi=\r\ntioning is still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;When one transcends one pro=\r\nblematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that la=\r\ny buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one.=\r\n If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion i=\r\nn one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great d=\r\noctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme e=\r\nxample, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescu=\r\nes the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescu=\r\ne the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings =\r\nto any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of p=\r\nrogress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;An awaken=\r\ned Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s=\r\n weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spi=\r\nritual problems.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The best approach I reco=\r\nmmend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, =\r\novercome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I wa=\r\nnt to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/=\r\npeople around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a=\r\n negative attachment.=C2=A0\n&gt;Don&#39;t worry about whether your Kundalini rises=\r\n or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (sha=\r\ndripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist the=\r\nm is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast as=\r\nleep, you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kun=\r\ndalini (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet =\r\nHer Lord (true Self).\n&gt;=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;One word on surrender=\r\ning to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do n=\r\not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be offended=\r\n by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&quot;I want X, I will p=\r\nray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I wil=\r\nl pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. Th=\r\nere is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no pla=\r\nce for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing =\r\noneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is a=\r\nccepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highl=\r\ny painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is =\r\nthinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and du=\r\nring) Death.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires a=\r\nnd wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, de=\r\nspite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;prot=\r\nect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you g=\r\no back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to =\r\nprotect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run=\r\n away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mi=\r\nnd like grave danger that one should run away from!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispass=\r\nion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken awa=\r\ny anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepare=\r\nd to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental condi=\r\ntioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundali=\r\nni rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadi=\r\ns will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting=\r\n True Self.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Best regards,Narasimha--------Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;--------\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;_____________________=\r\n___________\n&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Febru=\r\nary 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0=\r\nbut intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand b=\r\ny the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called=\r\n dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entit=\r\nies to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=\r\n=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the oth=\r\ner=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose=\r\n the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more =\r\ndetachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust,=\r\n greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one =\r\nhas to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a =\r\nfar more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3=\r\n - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really d=\r\noes - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and ent=\r\nities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are usele=\r\nss, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends=\r\n. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-uti=\r\nlizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n vital. 4 - W=\r\nhile someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Sh=\r\nakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of=\r\n this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insu=\r\nfficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that th=\r\ne aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences a=\r\nnd helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to var=\r\nious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That c=\r\nan allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chan=\r\nces of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various =\r\npossiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreo=\r\nver, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the righ=\r\nt knowledge to rectify the situation.

I am doing a ps=\r\nychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who =\r\nseems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since=\r\n childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy =\r\nin the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini u=\r\nntil her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not =\r\nbeen able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so=\r\n it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call me=\r\nntally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted sp=\r\nontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research int=\r\no this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not=\r\n well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for dera=\r\nnged\n kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken=\r\n the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kund=\r\nalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at t=\r\nimes because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it=\r\n will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered w=\r\nhat solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to =\r\nthe Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering =\r\nof this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. =\r\nMay I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for othe=\r\nrs like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. =\r\nAnd let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation =\r\nourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhap=\r\ns safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising=\r\n bit to God&#39;s will.

It is just A SMALL STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small d=\r\nilapidated house (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) =\r\nmay first construct the palace over time and\n move into it when it is COMPL=\r\nETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still un=\r\nder construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise=\r\n), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach =\r\nis safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards c=\r\nomplete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not=\r\n my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Secon=\r\ndly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient e=\r\nffort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previou=\r\ns life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it n=\r\now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when i=\r\nt comes in this life.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too =\r\nmany specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desire=\r\ns (because of constraints on what\n Nature can give you right now, arising f=\r\nrom YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want=\r\n LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one =\r\nmay pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very s=\r\nick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for=\r\n health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any =\r\nknowledge or money. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_13620678466=\r\n19_141&gt;In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One =\r\nmay be reborn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really =\r\nenjoy that experience. Basically, people &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1491792485yui=\r\n_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;keep going in circles through various lives, al=\r\nways &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, coming ba=\r\nck to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a=\r\n rising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain one from having it i=\r\nn THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destine=\r\nd to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful=\r\n, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it pani=\r\ncked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a cert=\r\nain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;We are =\r\nlike that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex a=\r\nnd scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If our i=\r\ndeas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect an=\r\nd if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realizat=\r\nion of that at some\n stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, =\r\nwithout being scared?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kundalini ri=\r\nse after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kund=\r\nalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left i=\r\nn one&#39;s system.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion abo=\r\nut who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in =\r\nconsciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes t=\r\nhe notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind c=\r\nomplex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1491792485yu=\r\ni_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3Dyiv1491792485userContent&gt;e.g. a =\r\ngreat doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/SPAN&gt;). A=\r\ns an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great =\r\nsoul who rescues\n the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y=\r\n who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!)=\r\n deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show =\r\nsome signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning m=\r\nay accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious =\r\npsychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR id=3Dyiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&gt;The best approach I reco=\r\nmmend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, =\r\novercome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I wa=\r\nnt to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/=\r\npeople around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment.&lt;/SPAN&gt; =\r\nIt is a\n negative attachment.&lt;WBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUN=\r\nD-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sa=\r\nns-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot; id=3Dyiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_1=\r\n9_1362067846619_155&gt;D&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141=\r\n&gt;on&#39;t worry about whether your Kundalini rises or not.

There is something you want =\r\nand you ask\n god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, =\r\ndemands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascinat=\r\nion for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord th=\r\nrows one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s pras=\r\nad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fas=\r\ncination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions expe=\r\nriences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a p=\r\nersonal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said belo=\r\nw. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmun=\r\nk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it wa=\r\ns scared.

Only deta=\r\nchment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes e=\r\ntc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self.

Constant efforts of purification of the various el=\r\nements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this tr=\r\nanslates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, cont=\r\nrol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awak=\r\nening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater fo=\r\nrce. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes car=\r\ne of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF a=\r\nnd when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various o=\r\nther things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while som=\r\ne of them are useless, and given half a chance can make\n use of the individ=\r\nual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and=\r\n nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes eve=\r\nn more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experie=\r\nnce of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycho=\r\nlogy are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west today =\r\nis puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possibl=\r\ne sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various =\r\nsubtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;r=\r\nuptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles,=\r\n trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind=\r\n and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very c=\r\nomplex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down =\r\nevery option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis\n is correctly done, very f=\r\new can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim th=\r\ney can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work. =\r\nSometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved=\r\n, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks=\r\n used to say - &lt;SPAN class=3Dyiv1491792485st&gt;Mens sana in corpore sano.&lt;/SP=\r\nAN&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv14=\r\n91792485MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; class=3Dyiv1491792485A=\r\npple-style-span&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(153,153,153)&quot; class=3Dyiv14917=\r\n92485Apple-style-span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: tim=\r\nes new roman, new york, times, serif&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1491792485yui_3_2_0_2_134=\r\n243527249950 yiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_92&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApa=\r\nnnam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana;=\r\n COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1491792485yui_3_2_0_2_1342435062=\r\n27946 yiv1491792485yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_17_13=\r\n62045432997_73 yiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_93&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0=\r\n00000 face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayam=\r\nanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospac=\r\ne, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot; class=3Dyiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_136206784=\r\n6619_95&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif=\r\n; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot; class=3Dyiv1491792485yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_96&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1=\r\npx solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-=\r\nTOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid&quot; class=3Dyiv1491792485hr&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; sunrise_1080 &l=\r\nt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:=\r\n bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndro=\r\nme&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1491792485&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV=\r\n id=3Dyiv1491792485ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of =\r\nkundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am=\r\n doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of s=\r\nomeone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kund=\r\nalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges=\r\n of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of =\r\nkundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. W=\r\ne have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests =\r\nnormal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people=\r\n we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or =\r\nunwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and r=\r\nesearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patie=\r\nnts are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatmen=\r\nts for deranged\n kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to for=\r\ncibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feelin=\r\ng that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill h=\r\nerself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. S=\r\nhe feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I=\r\n wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was =\r\nto pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the=\r\n suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to =\r\nbear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, a=\r\nnd for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is=\r\n pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this=\r\n situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. I=\r\nt is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundal=\r\nini\n rising bit to God&#39;s will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1637284482-52802472-1362108904=:98216--\r\n\n"}}
