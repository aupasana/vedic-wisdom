None of us wishes to waste o=\r\nur lifetime in futile spiritual pursuits. Please tell us what spiritual pat=\r\nh the character in this tale learnt and if it helped him. Perhaps it would =\r\nbe useful for us to know about this too.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nAparna\n\n\n--- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear =\r\nAjit,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am in complete agreement with your thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritual=\r\n man once said, &quot;Religion has been created to shield people from God&quot;.=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought it was som=\r\ne fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psycholo=\r\ngical constructs are created by religions to protect an average person from=\r\n the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if =\r\nand when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average l=\r\nife and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I will briefl=\r\ny narrate a true and interesting incident. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; An individual - say X -=\r\n had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting at a sa=\r\ntsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man,=\r\n with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who=\r\n was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sw=\r\neets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, =\r\n&quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, and reto=\r\nrted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If=\r\n God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectures as you=\r\n were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing=\r\n this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, look=\r\ned up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After he went out=\r\n, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a s=\r\nadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,\n&gt;  but he has probably lost hi=\r\ns mental balance due to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting the=\r\nre, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to=\r\n see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the =\r\nman turned around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting fo=\r\nr you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not expect the=\r\n man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how the man got to kn=\r\now that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clo=\r\nthes). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near =\r\nChennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have be=\r\nen a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu=\r\n who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actuall=\r\ny this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not =\r\nthe hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the rea=\r\nson for all the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irr=\r\nitated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? =\r\nIf you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single g=\r\nenuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take=\r\n Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confu=\r\nsed as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot =\r\nmeet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The =\r\nroot of\n&gt;  all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that=\r\n man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the h=\r\numan brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man o=\r\nr a magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhan=\r\na, one day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he=\r\n may even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be r=\r\negarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I sa=\r\ny the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finit=\r\ne mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking=\r\n, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one =\r\npull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5=\r\n minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You=\r\n (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n&gt;  =\r\nconfused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I w=\r\nas your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth=\r\n. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. B=\r\nut then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for=\r\n 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact with t=\r\nhis thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman an=\r\nd a young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyenga=\r\nr inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when=\r\n I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something inter=\r\nesting if you join me.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After an hour inside the house, X was feelin=\r\ng very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits and swe=\r\nets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as =\r\nhe lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one m=\r\nore fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly acce=\r\npting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as=\r\n this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the g=\r\nirl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot w=\r\nhere Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp =\r\ndirection to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. What he=\r\n saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged begg=\r\nar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his=\r\n early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brillian=\r\nt glow that lightened up the\n&gt;  whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms=\r\n, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked no=\r\nt a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five m=\r\ninutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; X did not know =\r\nwhat was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up a=\r\nnd come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the c=\r\not and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he wok=\r\ne up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shru=\r\nbs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside=\r\n the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an old =\r\nman, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar di=\r\nd not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X ou=\r\nt of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You should m=\r\neet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an idea=\r\n what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach that des=\r\nolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was losi=\r\nng awareness of place/time and lapsed into\n&gt;  unconsciousness again. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; When X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr=\r\n Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on =\r\nhis face. Next day, X went to the temple as directed. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhay=\r\nah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________=\r\n______________________\n&gt;  From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8:13 AM\n&gt; Subject: =\r\nRe: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any =\r\nreligion\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Prasanth,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To those who say that the=\r\ny don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In general, many of t=\r\nhose who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more honest than those =\r\nwho do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limited =\r\nbeing to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent w=\r\nhen dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize t=\r\nhese biases.\n&gt; \n&gt; While being mired in this word of duality, we think that =\r\nan ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we e=\r\nngage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder tha=\r\nt others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept o=\r\nf God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; \n&gt; We all have plenty of paapa=\r\n and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be=\r\n steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; a=\r\nnd leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives=\r\n, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya=\r\n phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial obs=\r\nerver sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the =\r\nculprit.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in=\r\n spiritual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the sec=\r\nonds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, a=\r\nnd time really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual b=\r\nhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it f=\r\nor what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-b=\r\nelievers&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate ou=\r\nr lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselv=\r\nes, the world will be served.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we see God as the limitless power tha=\r\nt he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a=\r\n religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask e=\r\nach of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher g=\r\noals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question.=\r\n They ask us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent =\r\nthe spiritually advanced from going any farther.\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
