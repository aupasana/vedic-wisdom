Its always calming t=\r\no take blame on ourselves by saying &#39;oh may be i did something in my past l=\r\nife and i am paying it back&#39; because if u do not think that,it means that s=\r\nomewhere something is unjustified and its far more painful to give blame to=\r\n god than to ourselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now for karma theory how does it explain the u=\r\nnspeakable crimes like rapes.. may be you heard about that case in Austria =\r\nof Miss elizabeth Fritzl. (you can google it) how does karma theory explain=\r\n it. I don&#39;t think any dignified explanation excluding blind beliefs can be=\r\n given for it. I have found people to be very callous towards such issues a=\r\nnd saying &#39;oh its just karma&#39;. that would be very shameful if we give such =\r\nan answer in this condition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also I would like to ask how wise it is t=\r\no reveal important knowledge to naive minds? \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Siya.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
