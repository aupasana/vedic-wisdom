If a bad ball comes out=\r\n as soon as you throw a good ball in, it does not mean the ball you threw j=\r\nust now was a bad ball. It means the good ball you threw will take some tim=\r\ne to come. Moreover, it was YOU who threw the bad ball that just came out, =\r\nin the past.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A ritual done with a negative attitude for bad purposes =\r\ncan be a bad karma. However, even if one did a good ritual, still that good=\r\n karma need not give results immediately. It depends on how dense one&#39;s kar=\r\nma pipeline is. If a pipe has very small balls and a big heavy ball is thro=\r\nwn into it very fast, it may push through previous existing balls and come =\r\nout quickly.

People who are married and have the wif=\r\ne and kid as responsibilities. Fulfilling the duties of husband is a blocka=\r\nge in the spiritual path. You know&nbsp; what i mean. &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;5. Why&nbsp=\r\n; did Gautam Buddha&nbsp; left his wife and his child and even then achieve=\r\nd the status of God? &lt;br&gt;6. A common person gives&nbsp; a damn to the conce=\r\npt of liberation. When ever i&nbsp; have discussion with people in my offic=\r\ne they think&nbsp; i am mad .
