This list should also include saints from sufism and\n&gt; &gt; othe=\r\nr religions\n&gt; &gt; We have a good history and books to refer too but we donot =\r\nhave a\n&gt; &gt; list of top 50 or so of living saints.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I request you =\r\nall to contribute if you know and are impressed \nwith\n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns would be a good thing to have so that many of us can seek\n&gt; &gt; darshan and=\r\n also seek guidance in future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The idea here is about quality and n=\r\not so much about quantity \nmeaning\n&gt; &gt; very reputed saints with thousands o=\r\nf disciple are already \nwellknown,\n&gt; &gt; I would not mind having them in the =\r\nlist but more important is\n&gt; &gt; realized saints who have chosen to remain hi=\r\ndden or have shun\n&gt; &gt; publicity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To Start of I shall start with=\r\n a very realized saint shri \nGanapathy\n&gt; &gt; Sacchianand Swamiji of Mysore, a=\r\n living Datta Avatar. He is the\n&gt; &gt; miracle man. I have had his darshan in =\r\nUS a few times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Once while I was on a pilgrimage to Pushkar about 8=\r\n years ago, I \ndid\n&gt; &gt; visit a saint known as bengali baba, a very realzied=\r\n saint in his\n&gt; &gt; 90s. He is still alive and has built a very unique hanuma=\r\nn temple \nin\n&gt; &gt; Pushkar Rajasthan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was a very interesting meeti=\r\nng. He spoke bengali only and I\n&gt; &gt; spoke hindi. He spoke for an hour. he u=\r\nnderstood all of what I \nsaid\n&gt; &gt; and asked and answered very sincerely in =\r\nbengali in a very \npassionate\n&gt; &gt; way, however I could only understand 10% =\r\nwhen the translator was \nable\n&gt; &gt; to keep up with him.\n&gt; &gt; My idea  here is=\r\n to find great saints in India who are also not\n&gt; &gt; wellknown as they may h=\r\nave chosen not to publize themselves too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I thought about this beca=\r\nuse while growing up, I missed a lot of\n&gt; &gt; oppurtunities to meet and seek =\r\ndarshan of many well known saints \nthat\n&gt; &gt; I am finding out now about thei=\r\nr greatness. I feel like I missed \nmany\n&gt; &gt; boats and still remain on the s=\r\name shore and waiting to cross the\n&gt; &gt; ocean.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope to get this list=\r\n going\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; Mitesh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
