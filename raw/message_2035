Mutilated them hence the problem.  \n\nThe =\r\nlord of the 7th house Mercury is sitting in the 4th house which confirm the=\r\n same.  Hence in order to rectify this issue you need to renovate a temple =\r\n(may not be in a big way but do it)and also the lord Mercury himself is bec=\r\noming the bhadhaka you need to visit a navagraha temple on any of your birt=\r\nh tithi which falls in any day of the month and offer sandalwood paste, per=\r\nfumes to the lord mercury.\n\nThis would sort out the issue of bhadhaka.  \n\nY=\r\nour 10th house lord JUpiter is sitting in the 11th house and got debilitate=\r\nd here and in  retrograde.YOu need to recite the mantra of brihapati and al=\r\nso perform pooja to him on every thursday by offering yellow flowers or gar=\r\nlands.\n\nRight now you are under saturn Maha dasa which started from 1998 ti=\r\nll 2017 with the antar dasa of Moon from 08.10.2009 till 08.10.2010.   Moon=\r\n is the lord of the 5th house governing your intelligence and children and =\r\nas Moon is getting in the 8th house there would be probability that your in=\r\ntelligence/thinking capability would be low and also you would find situati=\r\nons where your child would get sick \n\nI also recommend you to recite vishnu=\r\n mantra to get the issue resolved totally\n\nRegards\nUma shanker achanta\n\n\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;udayrajshinde&quot; &lt;udayrajshinde@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; DEAR SIR,\n&gt; \n&gt; MY SELF Udayraj\n&gt; DOB-12/06/1973\n&gt; TIME-02.20 AM\n&gt; P=\r\nLACE-Pune(Maharashtra)\n&gt; \n&gt; SIR,\n&gt; I HAVE CHANGED 3-4 TYPES OF BUSINESS & 2=\r\n-3 JOBS BUT I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.\n&gt; NOW I&#39;M MARRIED & HAVE ONE YEAR OLD CHILD=\r\n.\n&gt; I WANT STBILITY IN IN MY LIFE/JOB.\n&gt; RT.
