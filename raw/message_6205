He should engage in this quest, remembering the\nteaching that time is=\r\n unreal.\n\n483 Always and everywhere there are doorways for getting at the q=\r\nuestion\n=E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 By any one of these the seeker must aga=\r\nin and again engage his\nmind in this quest.\n\nThe nature of the answer to th=\r\nis question is next indicated.\n\n484 The answer to this question is not an i=\r\nntellectual conclusion. The\ncorrect answer to it is only the experience of =\r\nthe real Self. The supreme\nstate arises on the death of the ego, the questi=\r\noner who calls himself the\nindividual self.\n\n485 The real Self will shine a=\r\ns it really is only in the natural,\nthought-free state of the Self. In othe=\r\nr states the real Self will not shine\nas it really is due to its being mixe=\r\nd up with intellectual views.\n\nAnother hindrance to success in the quest is=\r\n now stated.\n\n486 If the mind thus engaged in the quest becomes unconscious=\r\n [as in deep\nsleep], the effort so far made becomes unfruitful. [So,] the s=\r\neeker should\nawaken the mind from this unconsciousness and again engage it =\r\nin the quest.\n\nWhat is needed is not unconsciousness of the mind, but its c=\r\nomplete\nextinction. This is clearly stated next, and it was also pointed ou=\r\nt in\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s Upadesa Saram.\n\n487 Mental quiescence has been expl=\r\nained by the Guru as being of two kinds,\nas latency in unconsciousness and =\r\nfinal extinction. In hatha yoga there are\nmany methods of attaining unconsc=\r\niousness, such as suspension of the breath.\n\nThe difference between these t=\r\nwo is then explained.\n\n488 The mind, when it has gone into latency together=\r\n with its habits of\nactivity, will later become active again to produce the=\r\n worldly life. The\nmind that has been extinguished will lose its habits of =\r\naction and thus\nbecomes like a seed that has been roasted.\n\nAs roasted seed=\r\n does not sprout, so the mind that has become extinct cannot\nbe reborn agai=\r\nn.\n\n489 Ignorance binds the ignorant one by means of [these] habits. If the=\r\n mind\nremains wide-awake in the quest, then the destruction of these habits=\r\n will\nensue.\n\n490 Right awareness dawns on the complete extinction of the m=\r\nind, whereby\nall the mental habits also are lost. Deliverance is affirmed b=\r\ny all sages to\nbe none other than the final and complete destruction of the=\r\n mental habits.\n\nApart from latency there is another obstacle, craving for =\r\nsense-pleasures.\nThis is pointed out next.\n\n491 One should overcome both de=\r\nsire and latency and keep the mind\nconcentrated in the quest. In the quest =\r\nfor the real Self, this is like\nbalancing on the keen edge of the razor.\n\nT=\r\nhe uniqueness of this method, the quest, is next explained.\n\n492 In all the=\r\n other yogas it is assumed that there is an entity called the\n=E2=80=98soul=\r\n=E2=80=99, having defects, namely action and the rest, and the yogi makes\ne=\r\nfforts to make himself free from those defects.\n\n493 For eradicating the de=\r\nfect of being an actor, there is the yoga of\naction; for getting rid of sep=\r\narateness [from God] there is the yoga of\ndevotion; for the cure of the def=\r\nect of [seeing] differences there is the\nyoga of mind-control; and for the =\r\neradication of ignorance there is the yoga\nof right awareness.\n\nThese yogas=\r\n are ridiculed by pointing out the truth of the real Self.\n\n494 While being=\r\n himself the same as the Supreme Being, the ignorant man,\nthinking himself =\r\nto be someone other than He, through delusion tries to\nbecome one with Him =\r\nby various yogas! What else is there more absurd than\nthis?\n\nThe superiorit=\r\ny of the quest is then shown.\n\n495 When, by taking hold of the consciousnes=\r\ns-element of the soul, the quest\nis made for the Self, the root of the soul=\r\n, the Self, who is free from all\ndefects, shines alone; there the soul does=\r\n not survive.\n\n496 Hence this [quest] is named =E2=80=98the great yoga=E2=\r\n=80=99. There is no other yoga\nequal to this, or greater. All the yogas are=\r\n included in it, and may be used\nas auxiliaries to this one, as may be foun=\r\nd suitable.\n\n497 This yoga, the quest of the source of the soul, is itself =\r\nall the yogas.\nIt is the yoga of action, the yoga of devotion, the yoga of =\r\nrestraining the\nmind and also the yoga of right awareness.\n\nThis quest of t=\r\nhe real Self, it is next pointed out, is not to be practised\nas a meditatio=\r\nn.\n\n498 Since this quest takes the form of a question, it is not to be prac=\r\ntised\nas a mode of meditation. By this question, the mind dives into the He=\r\nart,\nwhich it does not do by any series of meditations.\n\n499 Some practise =\r\ncontinuous meditation on the truth of one=E2=80=99s own Self,\nafter listeni=\r\nng to and reflecting upon that truth. This method is different\nfrom the que=\r\nst for the Self that is taught by Ramana.\n\nThe method taught by Bhagavan is=\r\n not an affirmation, but a question. The\nthreefold process is further expla=\r\nined.\n\n500 In the Chandogya Upanishad the identity of the Supreme Being and=\r\n the\nreal Self is taught by the sentence, =E2=80=98Thou art That=E2=80=99. =\r\nThis identity is\nconfirmed by distinguishing between the literal and the in=\r\ntended meanings\n[of the terms used].\n\nThe terms =E2=80=98Thou=E2=80=99 and =\r\n=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99, if taken in the literal sense, tend to show\nthat th=\r\nere can be no such identity. Hence, the intended meanings are sought,\nso th=\r\nat the identity may be accepted as true. The identity is not of the\napparen=\r\nt self, but of the real Self, with the Supreme Being. At the same\ntime the =\r\nSupreme Being is not the personal God but the impersonal being of\nthe Upani=\r\nshads. Both are of the nature of consciousness, and it is this\nconsciousnes=\r\ns that is the real essence of both. Thus, the identity is true.\n\nIt has bee=\r\nn assumed by the traditional schools of Advaita Vedanta that this\nsentence =\r\nconveys an injunction to meditate on the teaching. Actually, as\nBhagavan sa=\r\nys, the sentence states only a fact. The acceptance of it as a\nfact is not =\r\nenough. And meditation is no better. What is needed is to verify\nthe fact b=\r\ny reaching and remaining in the mind-free state, called also the\nnatural st=\r\nate. What he has said is as follows:\n\n501 Sri Ramana says that, without an =\r\nenquiry into the intended meaning of\nthe term =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 in the=\r\n sentence, one should make a quest for the truth of\nthe real Self, who is i=\r\nndicated by the term =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99.\n\nThis quest leads up to the mi=\r\nnd-free state in which the real Self shines\nunhindered by the veil of ignor=\r\nance, which is the ego, the false self. Then\nit will be realised that there=\r\n is only one entity, which is the real Self\nand also the impersonal Supreme=\r\n Being of the Upanishads.\n\nBhagavan calls the quest the direct path. It byp=\r\nasses the meditation\nmentioned before.\n\n502 By this quest the aspirant obta=\r\nins the direct experience of the real\nSelf in the transcendental state. For=\r\n him that has thus succeeded in this\nquest, there is no need for continuous=\r\n meditation or prolonged reflection.\n\nIt is here taken for granted that the=\r\n aspirant accepts the teaching of the\nidentity as true. This acceptance ari=\r\nses through his faith in the Guru who\nhas that experience, and who is there=\r\nfore a competent witness of that truth.\n\nSo, there is no injunction to medi=\r\ntate in the sentence cited.\n\n503 In the sentence of the ancient revelation =\r\n=E2=80=98You are That=E2=80=99, no meditation\nhas been enjoined. What is sa=\r\nid by implication is that in the egoless state\nthe sage has the experience =\r\nthat the impersonal is identical with his own\nreal Self.\n\n504 Since it is s=\r\nettled by the sentence of the Vedanta that one=E2=80=99s own real\nSelf, dis=\r\nentangled from the veiling sheaths, is the supreme reality, to\nattain the e=\r\nxperience of identity between that reality and the Self, what\nelse will wor=\r\nk except the quest of that Self?\n\nThis is obvious, says Bhagavan. The real =\r\nmeaning of the text, =E2=80=98Thou art\nThat,=E2=80=99 is next set forth acc=\r\nording to the spirit of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teachings.\n\n505 The meaning of t=\r\nhat vedantic text [You are That] is this: the Supreme\nBeing himself shines =\r\nas the real Self. If, seeking that Self, one gives up\nthe notion =E2=80=98I=\r\n am the body=E2=80=99 and becomes aware of one=E2=80=99s true nature, one\nb=\r\necomes firmly fixed in the Heart and shines as That.\n\nHas the meditation on=\r\n the truth any use at all?\n\n506 The quest of the truth of the Self is alone=\r\n the direct path to the right\nawareness of the Self. The meditation spoken =\r\nof is a preliminary aid to this\nquest. It is for breaking up the idea of th=\r\ne body as the Self.\n\nThis is what Bhagavan has said. In the way shown the m=\r\neditation is useful\nfor those who are not able to free themselves from thei=\r\nr ego-sense, by which\nthe body is identified as the Self.\n\nThe obstacles th=\r\nat may lie on the path are next dealt with.\n\n507 Diving into the Heart in t=\r\nhis quest of the Self does not occur in those\nwho have weak minds. For them=\r\n, the mind=E2=80=99s strength, being subdivided among\ninnumerable thoughts,=\r\n is insignificant.\n\nOne-pointedness of the mind is needed. A mind that is o=\r\nne-pointed will be\nstrong enough for this purpose. Curbing of the variety o=\r\nf thoughts is the\nexpedient to be adopted.\n\n508 The one-pointedness of the =\r\nmind in the quest is itself the strength of\nmind that is needed, and nothin=\r\ng else. He who has this strength of mind is\ncalled =E2=80=98valiant=E2=80=\r\n=99 because he has the skill to protect his intellect from\nbeing frittered =\r\naway.\n\n509 By the practice of meditation mental strength will be intensifie=\r\nd.\nTherefore meditation is an aid to the quest. After first achieving still=\r\nness\nof mind by meditation, the valiant aspirant must seek the truth of his=\r\n own\nSelf.\n\nThen the question arises, =E2=80=98What is to be taken as the o=\r\nbject of meditation?=E2=80=99\n\n510 For the seeker of deliverance the best o=\r\nf all possible objects for\nmeditation is the consciousness that has the for=\r\nm =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, since this is the\nessence of the real Self. By this =\r\nmeditation alone, the mind will naturally\ndive into the Heart. Such is the =\r\nteaching of our great Guru.\n\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, he has pointed out, is th=\r\ne name of that impersonal being, the subject\nmatter of the Vedantas. He has=\r\n said that this name is even holier than the\npranava [Om].\n\nAn alternative =\r\nmethod for stilling the mind=E2=80=99s thoughts, as recommended by\nBhagavan=\r\n, is stated next.\n\n511 Alternatively, if the aspirant for deliverance still=\r\ns the mind by pure\nkumbhaka [retention of breath], without puraka and recha=\r\nka [inhalation and\nexhalation], and thus engages in the quest, then his min=\r\nd will dive into the\nHeart.\n\nOrdinary pranayama consists of the three parts=\r\n, breathing in (puraka),\nretaining the breath within (kumbhaka), and breath=\r\ning out (rechaka). But\nhere the middle part (kumbhaka) alone is recommended=\r\n as a means of stilling\nthe mind. This may be mastered by steady practice. =\r\nThis is called kevala\nkumbhaka.\n\nThe same process is prescribed in the Yoga=\r\n Vasishta, as quoted below.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_=\r\nintro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =\r\n =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d501bf6f404a129f9fa\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n481 The devotee or the seeker of the Self who becomes discourage=\r\nd by the thought =E2=80=98When shall I attain the natural state?=E2=80=99 h=\r\ninders progress on the path of deliverance by having such a thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;482 The aspirant for deliverance must be full of enthusiasm, with his mind=\r\n in the sattvic mood.

The supreme state aris=\r\nes on the death of the ego, the questioner who calls himself the individual=\r\n self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;485 The real Self will shine as it really is only in the na=\r\ntural, thought-free state of the Self. In other states the real Self will n=\r\not shine as it really is due to its being mixed up with intellectual views.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAnother hindrance to success in the quest is now stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4=\r\n86 If the mind thus engaged in the quest becomes unconscious [as in deep sl=\r\neep], the effort so far made becomes unfruitful. [So,] the seeker should aw=\r\naken the mind from this unconsciousness and again engage it in the quest.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;What is needed is not unconsciousness of the mind, but its complete=\r\n extinction. This is clearly stated next, and it was also pointed out in Bh=\r\nagavan=E2=80=99s Upadesa Saram.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;487 Mental quiescence has been expla=\r\nined by the Guru as being of two kinds, as latency in unconsciousness and f=\r\ninal extinction. In hatha yoga there are many methods of attaining unconsci=\r\nousness, such as suspension of the breath.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The difference between =\r\nthese two is then explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;488 The mind, when it has gone into lat=\r\nency together with its habits of activity, will later become active again t=\r\no produce the worldly life. The mind that has been extinguished will lose i=\r\nts habits of action and thus becomes like a seed that has been roasted.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;As roasted seed does not sprout, so the mind that has become extinct =\r\ncannot be reborn again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;489 Ignorance binds the ignorant one by mean=\r\ns of [these] habits. If the mind remains wide-awake in the quest, then the =\r\ndestruction of these habits will ensue.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;490 Right awareness dawns =\r\non the complete extinction of the mind, whereby all the mental habits also =\r\nare lost. Deliverance is affirmed by all sages to be none other than the fi=\r\nnal and complete destruction of the mental habits.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Apart from late=\r\nncy there is another obstacle, craving for sense-pleasures. This is pointed=\r\n out next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;491 One should overcome both desire and latency and keep =\r\nthe mind concentrated in the quest. In the quest for the real Self, this is=\r\n like balancing on the keen edge of the razor.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The uniqueness of t=\r\nhis method, the quest, is next explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;492 In all the other yogas=\r\n it is assumed that there is an entity called the =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99, h=\r\naving defects, namely action and the rest, and the yogi makes efforts to ma=\r\nke himself free from those defects.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;493 For eradicating the defect of being an actor, there is the yoga of a=\r\nction; for getting rid of separateness [from God] there is the yoga of devo=\r\ntion; for the cure of the defect of [seeing] differences there is the yoga =\r\nof mind-control; and for the eradication of ignorance there is the yoga of =\r\nright awareness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;These yogas are ridiculed by pointing out the tru=\r\nth of the real Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;494 While being himself the same as the Supreme=\r\n Being, the ignorant man, thinking himself to be someone other than He, thr=\r\nough delusion tries to become one with Him by various yogas! What else is t=\r\nhere more absurd than this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The superiority of the quest is=\r\n then shown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;495 When, by taking hold of the consciousness-element o=\r\nf the soul, the quest is made for the Self, the root of the soul, the Self,=\r\n who is free from all defects, shines alone; there the soul does not surviv=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;496 Hence this [quest] is named =E2=80=98the great yoga=E2=80=\r\n=99. There is no other yoga equal to this, or greater. All the yogas are in=\r\ncluded in it, and may be used as auxiliaries to this one, as may be found s=\r\nuitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;497 This yoga, the quest of the source of the soul, is itse=\r\nlf all the yogas. It is the yoga of action, the yoga of devotion, the yoga =\r\nof restraining the mind and also the yoga of right awareness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This=\r\n quest of the real Self, it is next pointed out, is not to be practised as =\r\na meditation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;498 Since this quest takes the form of a question, it =\r\nis not to be practised as a mode of meditation. By this question, the mind =\r\ndives into the Heart, which it does not do by any series of meditations.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;499 Some practise continuous meditation on the truth of one=E2=80=99=\r\ns own Self, after listening to and reflecting upon that truth. This method =\r\nis different from the quest for the Self that is taught by Ramana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T=\r\nhe method taught by Bhagavan is not an affirmation, but a question. The thr=\r\neefold process is further explained.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;500 In the Chandogya Upanisha=\r\nd the identity of the Supreme Being and the real Self is taught by the sent=\r\nence, =E2=80=98Thou art That=E2=80=99. This identity is confirmed by distin=\r\nguishing between the literal and the intended meanings [of the terms used].=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The terms =E2=80=98Thou=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99, if t=\r\naken in the literal sense, tend to show that there can be no such identity.=\r\n Hence, the intended meanings are sought, so that the identity may be accep=\r\nted as true. The identity is not of the apparent self, but of the real Self=\r\n, with the Supreme Being. At the same time the Supreme Being is not the per=\r\nsonal God but the impersonal being of the Upanishads. Both are of the natur=\r\ne of consciousness, and it is this consciousness that is the real essence o=\r\nf both. Thus, the identity is true.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It has been assumed by the tra=\r\nditional schools of Advaita Vedanta that this sentence conveys an injunctio=\r\nn to meditate on the teaching. Actually, as Bhagavan says, the sentence sta=\r\ntes only a fact. The acceptance of it as a fact is not enough. And meditati=\r\non is no better. What is needed is to verify the fact by reaching and remai=\r\nning in the mind-free state, called also the natural state. What he has sai=\r\nd is as follows:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;501 Sri Ramana says that, without an enquiry into=\r\n the intended meaning of the term =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 in the sentence, o=\r\nne should make a quest for the truth of the real Self, who is indicated by =\r\nthe term =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This quest leads up to the mind-fre=\r\ne state in which the real Self shines unhindered by the veil of ignorance, =\r\nwhich is the ego, the false self. Then it will be realised that there is on=\r\nly one entity, which is the real Self and also the impersonal Supreme Being=\r\n of the Upanishads.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan calls the quest the direct path. It b=\r\nypasses the meditation mentioned before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;502 By this quest the aspir=\r\nant obtains the direct experience of the real Self in the transcendental st=\r\nate. For him that has thus succeeded in this quest, there is no need for co=\r\nntinuous meditation or prolonged reflection.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is here taken for =\r\ngranted that the aspirant accepts the teaching of the identity as true. Thi=\r\ns acceptance arises through his faith in the Guru who has that experience, =\r\nand who is therefore a competent witness of that truth.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;So, there =\r\nis no injunction to meditate in the sentence cited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;503 In the sente=\r\nnce of the ancient revelation =E2=80=98You are That=E2=80=99, no meditation=\r\n has been enjoined. What is said by implication is that in the egoless stat=\r\ne the sage has the experience that the impersonal is identical with his own=\r\n real Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;504 Since it is settled by the sentence of the Vedanta=\r\n that one=E2=80=99s own real Self, disentangled from the veiling sheaths, i=\r\ns the supreme reality, to attain the experience of identity between that re=\r\nality and the Self, what else will work except the quest of that Self?&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is obvious, says Bhagavan. The real meaning of the text, =E2=80=\r\n=98Thou art That,=E2=80=99 is next set forth according to the spirit of Bha=\r\ngavan=E2=80=99s teachings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;505 The meaning of that vedantic text [Yo=\r\nu are That] is this: the Supreme Being himself shines as the real Self. If,=\r\n seeking that Self, one gives up the notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99=\r\n and becomes aware of one=E2=80=99s true nature, one becomes firmly fixed i=\r\nn the Heart and shines as That.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Has the meditation on the truth an=\r\ny use at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;506 The quest of the =\r\ntruth of the Self is alone the direct path to the right awareness of the Se=\r\nlf. The meditation spoken of is a preliminary aid to this quest. It is for =\r\nbreaking up the idea of the body as the Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;This is what Bhagavan has said. In the way shown the =\r\nmeditation is useful for those who are not able to free themselves from the=\r\nir ego-sense, by which the body is identified as the Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe obstacles that may lie on the path are next dealt with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;507 Divi=\r\nng into the Heart in this quest of the Self does not occur in those who hav=\r\ne weak minds. For them, the mind=E2=80=99s strength, being subdivided among=\r\n innumerable thoughts, is insignificant.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One-pointedness of the mi=\r\nnd is needed. A mind that is one-pointed will be strong enough for this pur=\r\npose. Curbing of the variety of thoughts is the expedient to be adopted.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;508 The one-pointedness of the mind in the quest is itself the strengt=\r\nh of mind that is needed, and nothing else. He who has this strength of min=\r\nd is called =E2=80=98valiant=E2=80=99 because he has the skill to protect h=\r\nis intellect from being frittered away.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;509 By the practice of med=\r\nitation mental strength will be intensified. Therefore meditation is an aid=\r\n to the quest. After first achieving stillness of mind by meditation, the v=\r\naliant aspirant must seek the truth of his own Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Then the ques=\r\ntion arises, =E2=80=98What is to be taken as the object of meditation?=E2=\r\n=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;510 For the seeker of deliverance the best of all possible ob=\r\njects for meditation is the consciousness that has the form =E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99, since this is the essence of the real Self. By this meditation alon=\r\ne, the mind will naturally dive into the Heart. Such is the teaching of our=\r\n great Guru.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, he has pointed out, is the name =\r\nof that impersonal being, the subject matter of the Vedantas. He has said t=\r\nhat this name is even holier than the pranava [Om].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alternative m=\r\nethod for stilling the mind=E2=80=99s thoughts, as recommended by Bhagavan,=\r\n is stated next.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;511 Alternatively, if the aspirant for deliveranc=\r\ne stills the mind by pure kumbhaka [retention of breath], without puraka an=\r\nd rechaka [inhalation and exhalation], and thus engages in the quest, then =\r\nhis mind will dive into the Heart.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ordinary pranayama consists of =\r\nthe three parts, breathing in (puraka), retaining the breath within (kumbha=\r\nka), and breathing out (rechaka). But here the middle part (kumbhaka) alone=\r\n is recommended as a means of stilling the mind. This may be mastered by st=\r\neady practice. This is called kevala kumbhaka.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The same process is=\r\n prescribed in the Yoga Vasishta, as quoted below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach=\r\n/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_i=\r\nntro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;marg=\r\nin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;ma=\r\nrgin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d501bf6f404a129f9fa--\r\n\n"}}
