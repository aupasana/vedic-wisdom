One is doing it for oneself and not \nfor the deceased person. Irrespective of the beliefs of the deceased person, \nhis rinas (debts) with one will continue to affect one&#39;s consciousness and \nneed to be taken care of. One should follow sanatana dharma for oneself in \nsuch a case.\n\nAlso, when doing rites such as pitri tarpana, one should not think that one \nis helping or benefiting a deceased person. One should think that one is \nhelping oneself by freeing one from the kaarmik debts to the deceased \nperson.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;waspieswaspies&quot; &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 16, 2009 5:19 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Should Sutak be observed by family if the deceased \nrenounced their religion?\n\n\n&gt; Dear learned Gurujis and friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a little question and I was hoping someone could help me shed\n&gt; some light on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Should immediate (same &#39;kula&#39;) family members observe sutak time if\n&gt; the deceased had changed their religion and had stopped pratising the\n&gt; sanatan dharma tradition and had also instructed their sons not to\n&gt; perform any pinda/shraddha rites?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many Thanks,\n&gt; Somanathan\n\n\n"}}
