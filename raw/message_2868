The tradition of the family grows when we grow. The pattern of our\ncharacter and conduct is entirely determined by the idealogical background\nthat is at the very basis of the structure of that particular family. We are\nborn not merely in a family but also in wider circumstances called the\ncommunity, nation, world, universe, etc., to all which we owe obligations.\nOur obligation to a condition into which we are born is sacrifice or\n*Yajna* and\nthat is what Bhagavan Sri Krishna speaks of in the above verse.\n\nWhen we are born, we are born with certain obligations. What are these\nobligations? They are the allegiance that we perforce owe to those factors\nthat are responsible for our birth and maintenance. That is the sacrifice\nwhich we are called upon to do. In the *Vedas*, which are antecedent even to\nthe Mahabharata and the Bhagavadgita, we are given the first primeval\nconcept of sacrifice. Supreme sacrifice is extolled in the *Veda*, according\nto which the Absolute itself is the first performer of the *Yajna* and not\na *Pandit*. The Absolute did the first *Yajna* and then the others followed.\nThey are only imitating what the Absolute did, originally.\n\nWhat was the sacrifice that the Absolute did and who was the performer of\nthat sacrifice? Where was the *Vedi* or the *Yajna-kunda* for that sacrifice\nand what was the material that was offered in that sacrifice? *&#39;Yajnena\nYajnamayajanta Devah&#39;*, says the *Purusha-Sukta*. *Yajna* was the\nsacrifice, *Yajna* was offered in *Yajna* by *Yajna* for the sake of*Yajna*.\nSacrifice was offered in the sacrifice, through the sacrifice, for the sake\nof sacrifice. What do you understand from this? You understand nothing,\nexcept a jumble of words. Similar to this enigmatic statement of the *Veda*,\nwe have another statement in the Bhagavadgita also: *&#39;Brahmarpanam\nBrahmahavir-Brahmagnou Brahmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma\nSamadhina&#39;*. Brahman is offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of\nBrahman. What does it mean? It seems as confusing as that *Vedic Mantra*.\nBut let us remember that this is what sacrifice precisely means. It is a\nuniversal involvement of factors wherein and whereby we become the property\nof the whole creation. Can you imagine this situation where we become the\nproperty of everyone in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us, and\nwe must give it! We have an obligation to everything in this world. That\nobligation is the sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the *\nYajna*.\n\nOur obligation is not merely to our parents, brothers and sisters, not\nmerely to the government of our country that protects us, not merely to the\nplanet earth on which we live, not merely to the solar system which gives us\nlight, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger demands upon us and if we\ncan think for a moment the obligations that we really owe to this wonderful\ncreation of God, we will not be able to breathe for a moment! Because we are\nnot able to fulfil all these obligations in a short span of life, we are\nreborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we have fulfilled or discharged\nall our duties in this very life itself, why should we take next birth! But,\nlife is short, and also we have not got the least concept of what\nobligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Even when we are ninety\nyears old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, naturally we die with\nignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not able to discharge our\nduties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the duties and obligations\nproperly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so long as we do not\nunderstand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expected to perform and\nfulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of our existence, we\ncannot avoid undergoing this process of births and deaths.\n\nWhat are the conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditioning factor.\nThey have given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and educate us.\nSociety is another conditioning factor. You know how much we owe to the\nsociety. Though it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the society\nprotects us, takes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nation and the\ninternational system help us. The stellar systems also help us. In short,\nthe whole cosmos helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obligation to all\nthings in the universe. When we go for a walk in the jungles, sometimes a\npart of our cloth gets caught in a thorny bush and when we try to remove a\nthorn and move forward, we will find that another thorn is pricking us from\nbehind. When we try to remove that, here it pricks again, so that we find\nourselves unable to get out of it. When we are freed from one side, we are\ncaught from another side. Similarly, when we discharge one obligation, we\nwill find that another obligation has not been discharged. We cannot have an\nintegral vision of things. We are partial, short-sighted people. We have a\nvery narrow vision of things and it is this narrow vision that is\nresponsible for our birth and death.\n\nThis mysterious law, the law of *Yajna*, operates in the world. *&#39;Yajno vai\nVishnuh&#39;*--Supreme Narayana Himself is called *Yajna*. The term &#39;*Yajna*&#39;\nsignifies the whole of the culture of *Bharatavarsha*. If you want one word\nwhich can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture of India, &#39;*\nYajna*&#39; is that word. How meaningful it is, we can imagine. Every cultural\npattern and every presupposition of human existence is contained in this\npregnant term &#39;*Yajna*&#39;, which means the universal sacrifice that the soul\nperforms. The performer of the sacrifice is the soul. It is not an *Acharya* or\na *Pandit*.\n\nIn the *Anugita* of the Mahabharata, which is a sequel to the Bhagavadgita,\nthis *Yajna* is described in a very beautiful form. It states what\n*Yajna* actually\nis. This *Yajna* is going on daily in this body and it is going on\neverywhere in the world, outside and inside. It is sacrifice of all those\nfactors which tend to tether the soul to the bodily tabernacle into the fire\nof the knowledge of the Absolute. This is called *Jnana-Yajna* which means\nthe offering of knowledge into the fire of Knowledge. Which knowledge is\noffered into which knowledge? The knowledge of our individual existence in\nall its aspects is offered in the knowledge of the Supreme Being. The\nconcept of this mysterious *Dharma* before us cannot be contained in our\nminds. Our heads will burst if we start thinking deeply about these\nimplications of our life.\n\nKnowledge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the knowledge\nnecessary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their premonition,\nintuition or forevision that people cannot contain the *Vedic* knowledge in\ntheir heads. *&#39;Ananta vai Vedah&#39;*--*Vedas *are endless or infinite, which\nmeans to say knowledge has no limit. People in this *Kali Yuga* especially\nare so feeble physically, morally and intellectually, that this truth has to\nbe instilled into their minds through some other manner. This is why\n*Vyasa* wrote\nthe great Epic Mahabharata. He found out that the *Vedas* are of no use to\npoor human beings in this *Kali Yuga*. Whatever the *Vedas* say would not\nenter our heads, because they contain impersonal scientific knowledge. How\nmany of us are scientific? We are all ignorant, rustic villagers in our way\nof thinking. Crude thinking is our habit. Subtle, universal, scientific\nthinking as is contained in the *Vedas* is far from us.\n\nWhen I say the *Vedas* are scientific, I am not making a joke. Masters like\nSwami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the *Arya Samaj*; Sayana, the great\ncommentator of the*Vedas*; Aurobindo, of our own times; the Puri\nSankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all have struggled to\npoint out that every science is contained in the *Vedas*. Even subjects such\nas aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the highest type in\ndifferential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is in the *Vedas*. Sri\nBharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called &#39;Vedic Mathematics&#39;, and it\nhas been published by the Benares Hindu University. The *Veda Samhitas *contain\nthe highest reaches of Mathematics. Many think that the *Vedas* are only\nsome foolish chants of cowherds of Punjab, as British historians tell us.\nThe *Aryans* were regarded as cowherds grazing their cows in Punjab and\nblabbering something and that became the *Vedas*. This is the British\ninterpretation of our culture, which has gone into our heads! The *Vedas* are\nnot blabbering of that kind. They are intuitional revelations of ecstatic\nsouls who had the vision of the Absolute. And, therefore, this\nvision-integral contains every type of knowledge--physics, chemistry,\nbiology, sociology, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy, *Ayurveda*, military\nscience and what not. How can we contain all these things? We, therefore,\nbid good-bye to *Vedas*. So the master Vyasa, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa,\nwrote the Mahabharata and the *Puranas* to explain these very impersonal\nscientific truths of the *Vedas* in personal Epic style.\n\nIn villages some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a\nSari. She cannot tell directly to her husband, &#39;I want a Sari&#39;. So, she will\nsay: &quot;The neighbour&#39;s wife has purchased a new Sari today; it is very good,\nvery nice; I saw it myself.&quot; Her husband understands her intentions. He will\nsay: &quot;Why do you describe all these things? All right, I will purchase one\nfor you.&quot; And the poor man purchases a Sari. The Epics and *Puranas* follow\na similar indirect way of instructing the truths. But the *Vedas* directly\ntell the truth openly: &#39;You must do this, it is like this.&#39; This is\nscientific. Science always plainly tells the truth as it is, without any\ncamouflage. The Epics and the *Puranas* do not say directly that you must be\na good man. They say: &#39;Yudhishthira was a good man. His virtue was so\nimmense. He shared everything that he had. His conduct was so adventurous\nthat as a result he got so many things.&#39; One who hears this feels: &#39;Oh, I\nsee, then I must also do like that.&#39; These texts are called *Suhrit-Sammitas\n*, while the *Vedas* are known as *Prabhu-Sammitas*. The latter command like\na master. Science always commands on principles. The Puranas and Epics give\nstories, ancient history and make us think scientifically in an indirect\nmanner, as though with a sugar-coated pill. That is why it is said *&#39;Bharatam\nPanchamo Vedah&#39;*. While the *Vedas* are supposed to be four, the Mahabharata\nis the fifth*Veda*. It is as important as the *Vedas*. Sometimes they say,\nit is even more important than the *Vedas*.\n\nWhatever it is, when knowledge gets adulterated through intense sensory\nactivity, weakness of will and lack of moral force, the understanding of *\nDharma* also falls. So we must have a whip to goad us to the path of *Dharma\n*, spirituality and God-consciousness. The tradition of India,\nBharatavarsha, is full of such goading whips. While the *Vedas*, the Puranas\nand the Epics may be said to be direct teachers in an institution or an\nacademy, the culture of India has also instituted many occasions for\nbringing home to our mind facts of our eternal glory and our duties to God,\nthe world and mankind. We owe three kinds of duty which are mentioned in the\neighteenth chapter of the Bhagavadgita*, &#39;Yajno danam tapas-chaiva pavanani\nmanishinam&#39;*. They are *Yajna, Dana *and *Tapas*. *Yajna* itself contains in\nits meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on ethics. Still we are\ntold*Yajna*, *Dana* and *Tapas* constitute the highest necessity of\nreligion. While *Tapas* is the duty that we owe to our own selves, *Dana* is\nthat which we owe to others, and *Yajna* is that we owe to God. *Tapas* is\nausterity. We must perform austerity. We must live a very restrained life. *\nDana* is charitable feeling, charitable nature and charitable act in respect\nof others, while *Yajna* is the self-dedication we make of our own self\nwholly and totally to the Supreme Being.\n\nWe have various occasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefold\nduty. They are called *Vratas*, some of which are annual, some monthly and\nsome daily. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteenth day\n(*Chaturdasi*) of the dark-fortnight in the month of *Kartika*\n(October-November).\nPeople take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat delicious dishes.\nCrackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. There is an\natmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped and Divine\ngrace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated with this\ncelebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of the demon\nNarakasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from Indraloka,\nfrom where he brought the *Parijata* plant, to fulfil the wishes of\nSatyabhama, his consort.\n\nThe Dipavali festival is regarded as an occasion particularly associated\nwith an ancient event of Sri Krishna overcoming the demoniacal force known\nas Narakasura, recorded in the Epics and Puranas. After the great victory\nover Narakasura in a battle, which appears to have lasted for long, long\ndays, Sri Krishna with his consort Satyabhama returned to his abode in\nDwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka were very anxious about the delay caused\nin Sri Krishna&#39;s returning and it is said that they were worshipping\nBhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity and welfare of everyone and the quick\nreturning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and Satyabhama. And, after Sri Krishna\nreturned, the story goes that he took a bath after applying oil over his\nbody, to cleanse himself subsequent to the very hectic work he had to do in\nthe war that ensued earlier. This oil-bath connected with Sri Krishna&#39;s\nritual is also one of the reasons for people necessarily remembering to take\nan oil-bath on the day known as Naraka Chaturdasi, prior to the Amavasya,\nwhen Lakshmi Puja is conducted. Everyone in India remembers to take an\noil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in memory of, in honour of, Bhagavan Sri\nKrishna&#39;s doing that after the demise of Narakasura. Having taken the bath,\nthey all joined together in great delight in the grand worship of\nMaha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of everyone in Dwaraka. This is the\ntraditional background, as is told to us, of the rites and the worships\nconnected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dipavali Amavasya.\n\nThere is a third aspect of it which is called *Bali Padya*, the day\nfollowing Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festival is directly\nconnected with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it has another\nbackground altogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His incarnation as\nVamana, bestowed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom He subdued when\nHe took a Cosmic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the details of which we can\nread in the Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.\n\nBali Chakravarti was himself a great devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and\nhaving submitted himself to being thrown into the nether regions by the\npressure of the foot of Narayana in the Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of\nHim to have some occasion to come up to the surface of the earth and then be\nrecognised as a devotee of Bhagavan Narayana Himself. This recognition, this\nhallowed memory of Bali Chakravarti, is celebrated on the first day of the\nbright fortnight following the Amavasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are some of\nthe terms used to designate this occasion, the day next to Amavasya.\n\nSo, the sum and substance of the message connected with Dipavali is that it\nis a three day festival, beginning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day prior to\nAmavasya; then the main Lakshmi worship day, which is Amavasya itself; and\nthe third day which is Bali Padya connected with the honour bestowed upon\nBali Chakravarti as a devotee of Bhagavan Narayana. It is also an occasion\nfor spiritual exhilaration, a lighting up of all darkness, socially as well\nas personally, outwardly and inwardly, for the purpose of allowing an entry\nof the Supreme Light of God into the hearts of all people.\n**\n\n*Dipavali* means the line of lights. *Dipa* is light; and *Avali* means\nline. So, *Dipavali* or the festival of the line of lights is the\ncelebration of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of the\nvictory of the *Sattvic* or divine elements in us over the *Rajasic* and *\nTamasic* or baser elements which are the real *Asuras*, the *Rakshasas*, *\nNarakasura* and others. The whole world is within us. The whole cosmos can\nbe found in a microscopic form in our own body. *Rama-Ravana-Yuddha* and *\nTarakasura-Vadha*, and all such Epic wars,--everything is going on inside\nus. This Dipavali is thus also a psychological context, wherein we\ncontemplate in our own selves the holy occasion of self-mastery,\nself-subjugation and self-abnegation leading to the rise of all spiritual\nvirtues which are regarded as lustre or radiance emanating from\nSelf-Knowledge. *Bhagavati Mahalakshmi*, the Goddess of prosperity, does not\nmerely mean the Goddess of wealth in a material sense. *Lakshmi* does not\nmean only gold and silver. *Lakshmi* means prosperity in general, positive\ngrowth in the right direction, a rise into the higher stages of evolution.\nThis is the advent of *Lakshmi*. Progress and prosperity are *Lakshmi*. In\nthe *Vishnu Purana* we are told if *Narayana* is like the sun, *Lakshmi* is\nlike the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable. Wherever *Narayana* is,\nthere is *Lakshmi*. Wherever is divinity, there is prosperity. So on this\nday of *Dipavali* we worship the Supreme God who is the source of all\nconceivable virtues, goodness and prosperity, which is symbolised in\nillumination, lighting and worship in the form of *Arati* and gay joyous\nattitude and feeling in every respect. So, in short, this is a day of\nrejoicing over the victory of *Sattva* over the lower *Gunas*, the victory\nof God Himself over the binding fetters of the soul.\n\n *Aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah*\n*&quot;Let noble thoughts come to me from all directions&quot;\n- RIG VEDA*\n**\n*http://deosaranbisnath.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/people/Caribbean-Hindus/100000062834937\nhttp://jahajeedesi.blogspot.com\n*\nhttp://twitter.com/iTrinidad\n*http://hinducouncilofthecaribbean.blogspot.com/*&lt;http://hinducouncilofthecaribbean.blogspot.com/&gt;\nhttp://hindustt.blogspot.com/\n*http://twitter.com/Chaguanas* &lt;http://twitter.com/Chaguanas&gt;\n\n&lt;http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=634751846&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--000325556ed68e34fa0475d00162\r\nContent-Type: text/html;

do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna=\r\n), perform action for that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment=\r\n.&quot; (Gita III-9)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we are born into a particular set up of c=\r\nircumstances which we call a family, all the conditioning factors of the fa=\r\nmily are also born together with us. The tradition of the family grows when=\r\n we grow. The pattern of our character and conduct is entirely determined b=\r\ny the idealogical background that is at the very basis of the structure of =\r\nthat particular family. We are born not merely in a family but also in wide=\r\nr circumstances called the community, nation, world, universe, etc., to all=\r\n which we owe obligations. Our obligation to a condition into which we are =\r\nborn is sacrifice or=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0and that is what Bhagavan Sri Krishna=\r\n speaks of in the above verse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we are born, we are born with c=\r\nertain obligations. What are these obligations? They are the allegiance tha=\r\nt we perforce owe to those factors that are responsible for our birth and m=\r\naintenance. That is the sacrifice which we are called upon to do. In the=A0=\r\n&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;, which are antecedent even to the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad=\r\ngita, we are given the first primeval concept of sacrifice. Supreme sacrifi=\r\nce is extolled in the=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda&lt;/i&gt;, according to which the Absolute itself=\r\n is the first performer of the=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0and not a=A0&lt;i&gt;Pandit&lt;/i&gt;. =\r\nThe Absolute did the first=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0and then the others followed. T=\r\nhey are only imitating what the Absolute did, originally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was =\r\nthe sacrifice that the Absolute did and who was the performer of that sacri=\r\nfice? Where was the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedi&lt;/i&gt;=A0or the=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna-kunda&lt;/i&gt;=A0for that =\r\nsacrifice and what was the material that was offered in that sacrifice?=A0&lt;=\r\ni&gt;&#39;Yajnena Yajnamayajanta Devah&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, says the=A0&lt;i&gt;Purusha-Sukta&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;.=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0was the sacrifice,=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0was offered in=A0&lt;=\r\ni&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0by=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0for the sake of&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;. Sacrifice wa=\r\ns offered in the sacrifice, through the sacrifice, for the sake of sacrific=\r\ne. What do you understand from this? You understand nothing, except a jumbl=\r\ne of words. Similar to this enigmatic statement of the=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda&lt;/i&gt;, we ha=\r\nve another statement in the Bhagavadgita also:=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Brahmarpanam Brahm=\r\nahavir-Brahmagnou Brahmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma Sama=\r\ndhina&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. Brahman is offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of=\r\n Brahman. What does it mean? It seems as confusing as that=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedic Mantr=\r\na&lt;/i&gt;. But let us remember that this is what sacrifice precisely means. It =\r\nis a universal involvement of factors wherein and whereby we become the pro=\r\nperty of the whole creation. Can you imagine this situation where we become=\r\n the property of everyone in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us,=\r\n and we must give it! We have an obligation to everything in this world. Th=\r\nat obligation is the sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the=\r\n=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our obligation is not merely to our parents, broth=\r\ners and sisters, not merely to the government of our country that protects =\r\nus, not merely to the planet earth on which we live, not merely to the sola=\r\nr system which gives us light, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger =\r\ndemands upon us and if we can think for a moment the obligations that we re=\r\nally owe to this wonderful creation of God, we will not be able to breathe =\r\nfor a moment! Because we are not able to fulfil all these obligations in a =\r\nshort span of life, we are reborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we h=\r\nave fulfilled or discharged all our duties in this very life itself, why sh=\r\nould we take next birth! But, life is short, and also we have not got the l=\r\neast concept of what obligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Ev=\r\nen when we are ninety years old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, na=\r\nturally we die with ignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not abl=\r\ne to discharge our duties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the dut=\r\nies and obligations properly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so lon=\r\ng as we do not understand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expected=\r\n to perform and fulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of our=\r\n existence, we cannot avoid undergoing this process of births and deaths.&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are the conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditioning=\r\n factor. They have given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and edu=\r\ncate us. Society is another conditioning factor. You know how much we owe t=\r\no the society. Though it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the societ=\r\ny protects us, takes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nation and t=\r\nhe international system help us. The stellar systems also help us. In short=\r\n, the whole cosmos helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obligation to al=\r\nl things in the universe. When we go for a walk in the jungles, sometimes a=\r\n part of our cloth gets caught in a thorny bush and when we try to remove a=\r\n thorn and move forward, we will find that another thorn is pricking us fro=\r\nm behind. When we try to remove that, here it pricks again, so that we find=\r\n ourselves unable to get out of it. When we are freed from one side, we are=\r\n caught from another side. Similarly, when we discharge one obligation, we =\r\nwill find that another obligation has not been discharged. We cannot have a=\r\nn integral vision of things. We are partial, short-sighted people. We have =\r\na very narrow vision of things and it is this narrow vision that is respons=\r\nible for our birth and death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mysterious law, the law of=A0&lt;i&gt;=\r\nYajna&lt;/i&gt;, operates in the world.=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Yajno vai Vishnuh&#39;&lt;/i&gt;--Sup=\r\nreme Narayana Himself is called=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;. The term &#39;&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;&=\r\n#39; signifies the whole of the culture of=A0&lt;i&gt;Bharatavarsha&lt;/i&gt;. If you w=\r\nant one word which can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture=\r\n of India, &#39;&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;&#39; is that word. How meaningful it is, we ca=\r\nn imagine. Every cultural pattern and every presupposition of human existen=\r\nce is contained in this pregnant term &#39;&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;&#39;, which means t=\r\nhe universal sacrifice that the soul performs. The performer of the sacrifi=\r\nce is the soul. It is not an=A0&lt;i&gt;Acharya&lt;/i&gt;=A0or a=A0&lt;i&gt;Pandit&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the=A0&lt;i&gt;Anugita&lt;/i&gt;=A0of the Mahabharata, which is a sequel to the B=\r\nhagavadgita, this=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is described in a very beautiful form. I=\r\nt states what=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0actually is. This=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is going =\r\non daily in this body and it is going on everywhere in the world, outside a=\r\nnd inside. It is sacrifice of all those factors which tend to tether the so=\r\nul to the bodily tabernacle into the fire of the knowledge of the Absolute.=\r\n This is called=A0&lt;i&gt;Jnana-Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0which means the offering of knowledg=\r\ne into the fire of Knowledge. Which knowledge is offered into which knowled=\r\nge? The knowledge of our individual existence in all its aspects is offered=\r\n in the knowledge of the Supreme Being. The concept of this mysterious=A0&lt;i=\r\n&gt;Dharma&lt;/i&gt;=A0before us cannot be contained in our minds. Our heads will bu=\r\nrst if we start thinking deeply about these implications of our life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the knowl=\r\nedge necessary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their premonition, =\r\nintuition or forevision that people cannot contain the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedic&lt;/i&gt;=A0kno=\r\nwledge in their heads.=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Ananta vai Vedah&#39;&lt;/i&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Vedas=A0&lt;/i&gt;=\r\nare endless or infinite, which means to say knowledge has no limit. People =\r\nin this=A0&lt;i&gt;Kali Yuga&lt;/i&gt;=A0especially are so feeble physically, morally a=\r\nnd intellectually, that this truth has to be instilled into their minds thr=\r\nough some other manner. This is why=A0&lt;i&gt;Vyasa&lt;/i&gt;=A0wrote the great Epic M=\r\nahabharata. He found out that the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are of no use to poor hu=\r\nman beings in this=A0&lt;i&gt;Kali Yuga&lt;/i&gt;. Whatever the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0say wo=\r\nuld not enter our heads, because they contain impersonal scientific knowled=\r\nge. How many of us are scientific? We are all ignorant, rustic villagers in=\r\n our way of thinking. Crude thinking is our habit. Subtle, universal, scien=\r\ntific thinking as is contained in the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0is far from us.&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I say the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are scientific, I am not making a joke.=\r\n Masters like Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the=A0&lt;i&gt;Arya Samaj&lt;/i=\r\n&gt;; Sayana, the great commentator of the&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;; Aurobindo, of our own =\r\ntimes; the Puri Sankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all h=\r\nave struggled to point out that every science is contained in the=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda=\r\ns&lt;/i&gt;. Even subjects such as aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the=\r\n highest type in differential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is i=\r\nn the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called =\r\n&#39;Vedic Mathematics&#39;, and it has been published by the Benares Hindu=\r\n University. The=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda Samhitas=A0&lt;/i&gt;contain the highest reaches of Ma=\r\nthematics. Many think that the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are only some foolish chant=\r\ns of cowherds of Punjab, as British historians tell us. The=A0&lt;i&gt;Aryans&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n=A0were regarded as cowherds grazing their cows in Punjab and blabbering so=\r\nmething and that became the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. This is the British interpretat=\r\nion of our culture, which has gone into our heads! The=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are=\r\n not blabbering of that kind. They are intuitional revelations of ecstatic =\r\nsouls who had the vision of the Absolute. And, therefore, this vision-integ=\r\nral contains every type of knowledge--physics, chemistry, biology, sociolog=\r\ny, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy,=A0&lt;i&gt;Ayurveda&lt;/i&gt;, military science and=\r\n what not. How can we contain all these things? We, therefore, bid good-bye=\r\n to=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. So the master Vyasa, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, wrote th=\r\ne Mahabharata and the=A0&lt;i&gt;Puranas&lt;/i&gt;=A0to explain these very impersonal s=\r\ncientific truths of the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0in personal Epic style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In=\r\n villages some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a Sar=\r\ni. She cannot tell directly to her husband, &#39;I want a Sari&#39;. So, sh=\r\ne will say: &quot;The neighbour&#39;s wife has purchased a new Sari today; =\r\nit is very good, very nice; I saw it myself.&quot; Her husband understands =\r\nher intentions. He will say: &quot;Why do you describe all these things? Al=\r\nl right, I will purchase one for you.&quot; And the poor man purchases a Sa=\r\nri. The Epics and=A0&lt;i&gt;Puranas&lt;/i&gt;=A0follow a similar indirect way of instr=\r\nucting the truths. But the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0directly tell the truth openly:=\r\n &#39;You must do this, it is like this.&#39; This is scientific. Science a=\r\nlways plainly tells the truth as it is, without any camouflage. The Epics a=\r\nnd the=A0&lt;i&gt;Puranas&lt;/i&gt;=A0do not say directly that you must be a good man. =\r\nThey say: &#39;Yudhishthira was a good man. His virtue was so immense. He s=\r\nhared everything that he had. His conduct was so adventurous that as a resu=\r\nlt he got so many things.&#39; One who hears this feels: &#39;Oh, I see, th=\r\nen I must also do like that.&#39; These texts are called=A0&lt;i&gt;Suhrit-Sammit=\r\nas&lt;/i&gt;, while the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are known as=A0&lt;i&gt;Prabhu-Sammitas&lt;/i&gt;. T=\r\nhe latter command like a master. Science always commands on principles. The=\r\n Puranas and Epics give stories, ancient history and make us think scientif=\r\nically in an indirect manner, as though with a sugar-coated pill. That is w=\r\nhy it is said=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Bharatam Panchamo Vedah&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. While the=A0&lt;i&gt;Ve=\r\ndas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are supposed to be four, the Mahabharata is the fifth&lt;i&gt;Veda&lt;/i&gt;.=\r\n It is as important as the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes they say, it is even m=\r\nore important than the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, when knowled=\r\nge gets adulterated through intense sensory activity, weakness of will and =\r\nlack of moral force, the understanding of=A0&lt;i&gt;Dharma&lt;/i&gt;=A0also falls. So =\r\nwe must have a whip to goad us to the path of=A0&lt;i&gt;Dharma&lt;/i&gt;, spirituality=\r\n and God-consciousness. The tradition of India, Bharatavarsha, is full of s=\r\nuch goading whips. While the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;, the Puranas and the Epics may =\r\nbe said to be direct teachers in an institution or an academy, the culture =\r\nof India has also instituted many occasions for bringing home to our mind f=\r\nacts of our eternal glory and our duties to God, the world and mankind. We =\r\nowe three kinds of duty which are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of th=\r\ne Bhagavadgita&lt;i&gt;, &#39;Yajno danam tapas-chaiva pavanani manishinam&#39;&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;. They are=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna, Dana=A0&lt;/i&gt;and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;.=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0it=\r\nself contains in its meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on ethi=\r\ncs. Still we are told&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;,=A0&lt;i&gt;Dana&lt;/i&gt;=A0and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;=A0con=\r\nstitute the highest necessity of religion. While=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;=A0is the du=\r\nty that we owe to our own selves,=A0&lt;i&gt;Dana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is that which we owe to o=\r\nthers, and=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is that we owe to God.=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;=A0is aust=\r\nerity. We must perform austerity. We must live a very restrained life.=A0&lt;i=\r\n&gt;Dana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is charitable feeling, charitable nature and charitable act in =\r\nrespect of others, while=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is the self-dedication we make of=\r\n our own self wholly and totally to the Supreme Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have vari=\r\nous occasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefold duty. They =\r\nare called=A0&lt;i&gt;Vratas&lt;/i&gt;, some of which are annual, some monthly and some=\r\n daily. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteenth day (&lt;i=\r\n&gt;Chaturdasi&lt;/i&gt;) of the dark-fortnight in the month of=A0&lt;i&gt;Kartika&lt;/i&gt;=A0(=\r\nOctober-November). People take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat del=\r\nicious dishes. Crackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. Th=\r\nere is an atmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped =\r\nand Divine grace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated with =\r\nthis celebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of the demon=\r\n Narakasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from Indraloka,=\r\n from where he brought the=A0&lt;i&gt;Parijata&lt;/i&gt;=A0plant, to fulfil the wishes =\r\nof Satyabhama, his consort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dipavali festival is regarded as an=\r\n occasion particularly associated with an ancient event of Sri Krishna over=\r\ncoming the demoniacal force known as Narakasura, recorded in the Epics and =\r\nPuranas. After the great victory over Narakasura in a battle, which appears=\r\n to have lasted for long, long days, Sri Krishna with his consort Satyabham=\r\na returned to his abode in Dwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka were very anxi=\r\nous about the delay caused in Sri Krishna&#39;s returning and it is said th=\r\nat they were worshipping Bhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity and welfare o=\r\nf everyone and the quick returning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and Satyabhama. =\r\nAnd, after Sri Krishna returned, the story goes that he took a bath after a=\r\npplying oil over his body, to cleanse himself subsequent to the very hectic=\r\n work he had to do in the war that ensued earlier. This oil-bath connected =\r\nwith Sri Krishna&#39;s ritual is also one of the reasons for people necessa=\r\nrily remembering to take an oil-bath on the day known as Naraka Chaturdasi,=\r\n prior to the Amavasya, when Lakshmi Puja is conducted. Everyone in India r=\r\nemembers to take an oil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in memory of, in honour o=\r\nf, Bhagavan Sri Krishna&#39;s doing that after the demise of Narakasura. Ha=\r\nving taken the bath, they all joined together in great delight in the grand=\r\n worship of Maha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of everyone in Dwaraka. Thi=\r\ns is the traditional background, as is told to us, of the rites and the wor=\r\nships connected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dipavali Amavasya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There=\r\n is a third aspect of it which is called=A0&lt;i&gt;Bali Padya&lt;/i&gt;, the day follo=\r\nwing Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festival is directly connec=\r\nted with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it has another background a=\r\nltogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His incarnation as Vamana, bes=\r\ntowed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom He subdued when He took a =\r\nCosmic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the details of which we can read in t=\r\nhe Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bali Chakravarti was himself a grea=\r\nt devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and having submitted himself to being t=\r\nhrown into the nether regions by the pressure of the foot of Narayana in th=\r\ne Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of Him to have some occasion to come up=\r\n to the surface of the earth and then be recognised as a devotee of Bhagava=\r\nn Narayana Himself. This recognition, this hallowed memory of Bali Chakrava=\r\nrti, is celebrated on the first day of the bright fortnight following the A=\r\nmavasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are some of the terms used to designate this=\r\n occasion, the day next to Amavasya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the sum and substance of t=\r\nhe message connected with Dipavali is that it is a three day festival, begi=\r\nnning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day prior to Amavasya; then the main Lakshm=\r\ni worship day, which is Amavasya itself; and the third day which is Bali Pa=\r\ndya connected with the honour bestowed upon Bali Chakravarti as a devotee o=\r\nf Bhagavan Narayana. It is also an occasion for spiritual exhilaration, a l=\r\nighting up of all darkness, socially as well as personally, outwardly and i=\r\nnwardly, for the purpose of allowing an entry of the Supreme Light of God i=\r\nnto the hearts of all people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dipavali&lt;/i&gt;=A0means the li=\r\nne of lights.=A0&lt;i&gt;Dipa&lt;/i&gt;=A0is light; and=A0&lt;i&gt;Avali&lt;/i&gt;=A0means line. So=\r\n,=A0&lt;i&gt;Dipavali&lt;/i&gt;=A0or the festival of the line of lights is the celebrat=\r\nion of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of the victory of =\r\nthe=A0&lt;i&gt;Sattvic&lt;/i&gt;=A0or divine elements in us over the=A0&lt;i&gt;Rajasic&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n=A0and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tamasic&lt;/i&gt;=A0or baser elements which are the real=A0&lt;i&gt;Asuras&lt;=\r\n/i&gt;, the=A0&lt;i&gt;Rakshasas&lt;/i&gt;,=A0&lt;i&gt;Narakasura&lt;/i&gt;=A0and others. The whole wo=\r\nrld is within us. The whole cosmos can be found in a microscopic form in ou=\r\nr own body.=A0&lt;i&gt;Rama-Ravana-Yuddha&lt;/i&gt;=A0and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tarakasura-Vadha&lt;/i&gt;, an=\r\nd all such Epic wars,--everything is going on inside us. This Dipavali is t=\r\nhus also a psychological context, wherein we contemplate in our own selves =\r\nthe holy occasion of self-mastery, self-subjugation and self-abnegation lea=\r\nding to the rise of all spiritual virtues which are regarded as lustre or r=\r\nadiance emanating from Self-Knowledge.=A0&lt;i&gt;Bhagavati Mahalakshmi&lt;/i&gt;, the =\r\nGoddess of prosperity, does not merely mean the Goddess of wealth in a mate=\r\nrial sense.=A0&lt;i&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;=A0does not mean only gold and silver.=A0&lt;i&gt;Lak=\r\nshmi&lt;/i&gt;=A0means prosperity in general, positive growth in the right direct=\r\nion, a rise into the higher stages of evolution. This is the advent of=A0&lt;i=\r\n&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;. Progress and prosperity are=A0&lt;i&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;. In the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vis=\r\nhnu Purana&lt;/i&gt;=A0we are told if=A0&lt;i&gt;Narayana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is like the sun,=A0&lt;i&gt;L=\r\nakshmi&lt;/i&gt;=A0is like the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable. Whereve=\r\nr=A0&lt;i&gt;Narayana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is, there is=A0&lt;i&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;. Wherever is divinity, =\r\nthere is prosperity. So on this day of=A0&lt;i&gt;Dipavali&lt;/i&gt;=A0we worship the S=\r\nupreme God who is the source of all conceivable virtues, goodness and prosp=\r\nerity, which is symbolised in illumination, lighting and worship in the for=\r\nm of=A0&lt;i&gt;Arati&lt;/i&gt;=A0and gay joyous attitude and feeling in every respect.=\r\n So, in short, this is a day of rejoicing over the victory of=A0&lt;i&gt;Sattva&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;=A0over the lower=A0&lt;i&gt;Gunas&lt;/i&gt;, the victory of God Himself over the bin=\r\nding fetters of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;+0&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#=\r\nc00000&quot; size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000bf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt color=3D&quot;#0000bf&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-CO=\r\nLOR: rgb(223,255,191)&quot; face=3D&quot;verdana&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;stron=\r\ng&gt;Aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BA=\r\nCKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(223,=\r\n255,191)&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Let noble thoughts com=\r\ne to me from all directions&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;- RIG VEDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/s=\r\ntrong&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,2=\r\n55,255)&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://deosaranbisnath.blo=\r\ngspot.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://deosaranbisnath.blogs=\r\npot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.facebook.com/people/Caribbean-Hindus/1=\r\n00000062834937&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/=\r\npeople/Caribbean-Hindus/100000062834937&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://jahajeede=\r\nsi.blogspot.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://jahajeedesi.blo=\r\ngspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com/iTrinidad&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/iTrinidad&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://hinducouncilofthecaribbean.blogsp=\r\not.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http:/=\r\n/hinducouncilofthecaribbean.blogspot.com/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://hindustt.blogspot.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;http://hindustt.blogspot.com/&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font =\r\ncolor=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com/Chaguanas&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/Chaguana=\r\ns&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=3D634751846&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; COLOR: =\r\nwhite&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000325556ed68e34fa0475d00162--\r\n\n"}}
