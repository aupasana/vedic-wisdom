Leave all the theory aside, mind is a monkey and it will jump=\r\n over, so you \n&gt; dotn have to follow any thought. OCD means a compulsive mo=\r\nnkey.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Do 20 min homam daily, pick ur favourite god, choose one simp=\r\nle mantra, offer \n&gt; in fire atleast 108 times with full love and devotion. =\r\nDo it regularly for 3-4 \n&gt; months\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Choose a good homeopathy. there i=\r\ns a site abchomeoapthy where\n&gt; brisbanehomeopath gives free consultations a=\r\nnd you can post ur queries daily, he \n&gt; will help you out.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Bach flo=\r\nwer remedies for OCD is combination of Cherryplum + Whitechestnut. if \n&gt; yo=\r\nu want detailed analysis respond on my personal id.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Join a group la=\r\nlkitab_remedies and post your birth details, remedies for your \n&gt; problems =\r\nas per your chart will be given. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Your reality is reflection of =\r\nyour karma, with medicines you can contorl and \n&gt; change it upto a certain =\r\nextent. Only with intense sadhana you can change your \n&gt; Karma and reality =\r\nitself. such is the power of intense sadhana. 20-30min of \n&gt; homam is indee=\r\nd equivalent to 4-5hrs of intense meditation. PVR said this some \n&gt; time ba=\r\nck, i doubted it at that time but when i did it i realised it was \n&gt; correc=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; priyank\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;as1647=\r\n5&quot; &lt;as16475@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear sir,\n&gt; &gt; namskar\n&gt; &gt; There was a time whe=\r\nn I didnt use to have my meals before thanking god. I used \n&gt; &gt;to remember =\r\ngod 24 hors a day. But in 1990 I started fearing god and now I hate \n&gt; &gt;him=\r\n so much so that I destroyed my home made temple and his posters. why i did=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;so the reason is as below:\n&gt; &gt; I am suffering from ocd (Obsessive comp=\r\nulsive disorder) since 1990. My problem \n&gt; &gt;is that whenever I am doing som=\r\ne work some part of my mind says that if this \n&gt; &gt;work gets done I will go =\r\nto temple but it is not me and I counter this thought \n&gt; &gt;by saying that I =\r\nwill not go to temple. But at the completion of the work I am \n&gt; &gt;compelled=\r\n to go to temple. The problem is that I have to go to temple \n&gt; &gt;compulsive=\r\nly and many times again and again. Also the temple which comes to my \n&gt; &gt;th=\r\noughts has to be visited to satisfy my compulsion. Even a simple thought th=\r\nat \n&gt; &gt;if my son answers the question I will go to temple. I am not even ab=\r\nle to teach \n&gt; &gt;him. I cant cross the road where there is a temple. How can=\r\n I avoid that. There \n&gt; &gt;are temples all around the world. Please help me o=\r\nut. For past 10 yrs I am \n&gt; &gt;taking allopathy medicine. For past 7 months I=\r\n am taking homeopathy also. But \n&gt; &gt;sometimes it goes out of control. Pleas=\r\ne guide me how can I stop hating GOD. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dob :16th a=\r\npril,1975\n&gt; &gt; Place:  kangra (Himachal Pradesh)\n&gt; &gt; Time : 8 pm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
