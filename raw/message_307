Due to different beliefs and practices in existin=\r\ng\nreligions, something that is regarded as holy in one religion may be\ncons=\r\nidered unholy in another. As a result, religion has often\nprevented the spr=\r\nead of unity among human beings; it has instead, led\nto disagreement, hatre=\r\nd, war and even genocide in the world.\n\nIn an effort to be tolerant and mor=\r\ne inclusive than others, Hinduism\nhas made &quot;the blanket that all religions =\r\nare true, valid and equal and\nlead to the same goal=97what could be called =\r\na `radical universalism&#39;,&quot;\nsays the author. It is this radical universalism=\r\n that promotes\nacceptance of all religions as same in order to lead us to u=\r\nnity\nbehind our religious strivings=97it is immaterial what religion one\nfo=\r\nllows or whether one goes to a church, mosque or a temple. One needs\nto hav=\r\ne full faith in the religion that one has adopted to reach the\nhighest trut=\r\nh.\n\nDifferent religions of the world contain various doctrines and\nteaching=\r\ns that cannot all be equally valid. Here the author states\nthat the law of =\r\nkarma and rebirth, for example, is either true or\nfalse. &quot;If it is true, th=\r\nen religions which do not teach it are\nflawed. If it is not true, then the =\r\nreligions that teach are\nincorrect. Both cannot be true at the same time.&quot; =\r\nHe says that\nsimilarly there can be no final guru, prophet or saviour for a=\r\nll\nhumanity. Religion should, in its real import, be a quest for eternal\ntr=\r\nuth and &quot;seeking to realise it within our own consciousness.&quot; This\nmeans th=\r\nat we question everything and accept only that which is proved\nby our exper=\r\niences.\n\nHindu Dharma &quot;teaches us pluralism relative to the spiritual life,=\r\n\nwhich can both tolerate many points of view but also discriminate\nbetween =\r\nthem and find out what is best for each individual.&quot; Thus an\nenlightened pl=\r\nuralism must rest upon a higher sense of discrimination.\n\nIn this book Dr M=\r\norales bases his views on a rationality reflecting\nthe great principles of =\r\nVedanta, which insist upon a clear\nunderstanding of the issue and not just =\r\nthe imposition of one&#39;s belief\nas the answer. He shows how the Hindu tradit=\r\nion does not teach us\nblind equation of all religions, but instead emphasis=\r\nes on enlightened\npluralism. This not only allows the existence of many pat=\r\nhs but\ninsists that only a razor-sharp path can take us to our highest goal=\r\n.\n\nIt is heartening to read a Western scholar of Hinduism say that a\ntradit=\r\nional Hindu has always been the most tolerant of all religious\npersons and =\r\nthat Hindu India has been the sole nation on earth where\nthe Jewish communi=\r\nty was never persecuted and who have lived in India\nfor over 200 years. Sim=\r\nilarly Zoroastrian refugees, escaping the\ndestruction of Persian civilisati=\r\non at the hands of Islamic\nconquerors, were greeted with welcome refuge in =\r\nIndia over 1,000 years\nago. The Zoroastrian community, now known as Parsis,=\r\n has thrived in\nIndia in all these many centuries, living together as they =\r\ndo with\ntheir Hindu neighbours in peace and mutual respect. He says that in=\r\n\nkeeping with the Vedic adage that the guest in one&#39;s home is to be\ntreated=\r\n with as much hospitality as a visiting divinity, Hindus have\nalways lived =\r\npeacefully with indigenous Indian religions like\nBuddhism, Jainism and Sikh=\r\nism and even the foreign religions like\nChristianity and Islam.\n\n(Voice of =\r\nIndia, 2/18 Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi-110 002.)\n\n\nPurchase your cop=\r\ny of &quot;Radical Universalism&quot; online:\n\nhttp://www.bibliaimpex.com/index.php?S=\r\ntring=3D44800&p=3Dsr&Field=3Dbookcode&Exactly=3Dye&#92;\ns&Format=3Ddetail\n\n\nOm =\r\nShanti\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
