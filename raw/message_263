But first I want to recommend a couple of books:\n \n(1) =\r\n&quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is undoubtedly one of the best works available to a spir=\r\nitually inclined person with interest in vedanta. It is a practical book wi=\r\nth many stories (unlike most dry vedanta books) and teaches profound lesson=\r\ns through stories.\n \nInterestingly, I am typing this on the eve of Sree Ram=\r\na Navami (by the way, happy Sree Rama Navami to all of you!). When Maharshi=\r\n Vishwamitra came to request Dasaratha to send Lord Rama with him to protec=\r\nt his yajna from demons, Dasaratha was hesitant and Lord Ramachandra was co=\r\nnfused. At the request of Maharshi Vishwamitra and others, Maharshi Vasisht=\r\nha taught Lord Ramachandra the essence of the knowledge of Self, in front o=\r\nf other maharshis, kings and gods. These teachings were captured by Maharsh=\r\ni Valmiki as the book &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;.\n \nThis work helped even maharshis=\r\n like Bharadwaja to obtain Brahma jnana. When Valmiki explained Vasishtha&#39;s=\r\n teachings to Bharadwaja, he became realized.\n \nThere is a truly inspired E=\r\nnglish translation by Swami Venkatesananda, a disciple of Swami Sivananda o=\r\nf Hrishikesh (Divine Life Society). Swami Sivananda is considered by some t=\r\no be a re-incarnation of Maharshi Vasishtha.\n \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Vasist=\r\nhas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640\n \nThis is the best book I have read i=\r\nn my life and I can say this is the book that influenced me the most and ch=\r\nanged my thinking.\n \n(2) Bhagavad Gita is a marvelous compendium on practic=\r\nal spirituality. It covers various paths like jnana yoga, raja yoga, bhakti=\r\n yoga, karma yoga, sannyasa yoga etc. While there are many commentaries and=\r\n translations, I prefer the treatment of Sant Jnaneshwar. He is a rare Kris=\r\nhna bhakta who is also associated with the path of aghora and nathas! While=\r\n most Krishna bhaktas follow dwaita and vivishtaadwaita, Jnaneshwar&#39;s treat=\r\nment is purely adwaitic.\n \nIn Yoga Vasishtham, Vasishtha tells Rama that Vi=\r\nshnu would appear as Krishna in a later yuga and teach the essence of Veda =\r\nto Arjuna. Vasishtha goes to great lengths on what Krishna teaches. Some mo=\r\ndern commentaries on Bhagavad Gita deviate from the adwaitic principles of =\r\nvedanta and interpret some teachings of Krishna in a way that contradicts V=\r\nasishtha&#39;s take. Sant Jnaneshwar&#39;s interpretation is consistent with Vasish=\r\ntha&#39;s and also consistent with upanishads and vedanta.\n \nhttp://www.amazon.=\r\ncom/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n \n*        =\r\n*        *\n \n&gt; &gt; But What a real spiritualism is still yet to defined....\n =\r\n\nSelf-realized person is one who has realized that all is Brahman and not b=\r\nound by any limited ego, even though actions continue to spring from a prev=\r\niously existing ego (that continues to wind down like a fan after electrici=\r\nty is turned off).\n \nSpiritual person is one who is making *some progress* =\r\ntowards becoming a self-realized person at a point in future.\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nUnfrotunately, scriptures can describe a self-realized person an=\r\nd how he thinks, but they cannot give any fool-proof steps which, when foll=\r\nowed by one, can ensure self-realization.\n \nJust thinking &quot;all is Brahman&quot; =\r\nand understanding it *intellctually* is not sufficient. Let me drive my poi=\r\nnt home using an analogy.\n \nSuppose someone goes to a movie and becomes so =\r\ninvolved in the movie that he behaves as through something is really happen=\r\ning on the screen. For example, suppose there is a scene where the heroine =\r\nis in a dark room and villain is about to stab her in the back from behind =\r\nher. Suppose there is tense music. One may be shuddering with expectation. =\r\nOne may jump with shock and tension.\n \nThere may be one person who complete=\r\nly realizes that this is just an illusion and nothing is actually happening=\r\n and watches it without any emotional involvement whatsoever. He is anlogou=\r\ns to a realized person. Suppose someone is so involved and shouts with happ=\r\niness when something good happens in the movie and shudders when something =\r\nterrible happens in the movie. He is analogous to a person deeply stuck in =\r\nmaya. Really speaking, this life we live is quite similar to a big movie, e=\r\nxcept that it is interactive. Thus, my analogy is quite appropriate.\n \nNow,=\r\n one smart person may very well know that this movie thing is not really ha=\r\nppening and hence controlling emotions mostly. But an odd scene may make hi=\r\nm shudder too! Such a person is analogous to one who intellectually underst=\r\nands and appreciates the essence of Veda (that all is Brahman and the objec=\r\nts we see are all an illusion) and yet does not fully comprehend it.\n \nIf o=\r\nne fully realizes, then nothing should make one happy or sad internally. On=\r\ne may act externally as though one is happy or sad, but the heart should be=\r\n stable always and not excited or depressed by *anything*. If all is Brahma=\r\nn, why should anything exicte you depress you? In our analogy, such a perso=\r\nn is like one watching the movie with zero involvement, realizing at all ti=\r\nmes that it is only imaginary and not happening for real and not being shak=\r\nen even once. One who has only an intellectual understanding and not a comp=\r\nlete understanding may some times be affected by the illusion.\n \nIf someone=\r\n praises you, does it excite you? If someone humiliates, does it upset you?=\r\n If something seems nice, do you want to have it? If something seems disgus=\r\nting, do you want to go away?\n \nAs long as there is attachment and self-ide=\r\nntification with a body or a name or some other limited object, some ego re=\r\nmains and causes all of the above. It results in happiness on some events a=\r\nnd sadness on some events. Self-realization cannot come without overcoming =\r\nego *fully*. It never comes from an intellectual understanding of the dictu=\r\nm &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. It comes from experiencing it.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nHow can one go from a limited ego to zero ego? There is no single path. As =\r\nI said already, scriptures only describe how a realized person thinks, but =\r\nthey cannot give a fool-proof path to realization.\n \nHowever, some scriptur=\r\nes do outline some paths for reference. While they are not fool-proof and d=\r\no not guarantee realization, they can be helpful.\n \nOne person may sit down=\r\n in seclusion in a forest or in Himalayas or a remote cave and keep eating =\r\nenough to just survive and actively contemplate all the time &quot;Who am I? Am =\r\nI this body? Who am I? What are all these objects I perceive? What is all t=\r\nhis?&quot; and eventually realize Self. This is jnana yoga.\n \nOne person may pra=\r\ny to a specific deity and slowly force oneself to see the entire universe a=\r\ns another form of that deity and see that deity in everything. One may even=\r\ntually realize Self through that deity. This is bhakti yoga.\n \nOne person m=\r\nay consider work and service as god and spend all of one&#39;s time serving peo=\r\nple without prejudices, without any self-pride and without any selfish moti=\r\nves. One may try to see god in all people and all service and may eventuall=\r\ny realize Self. This is karma yoga.\n \nOne person may use forceful methods o=\r\nf raja yoga, control the body, senses and mind through yogic practices, for=\r\ncefully raise self-awareness (Kundalini shakti) to higher realms of conscio=\r\nusness. They too may eventually realize Self.\n \nIn each of these four broad=\r\n paths, there are many sub-paths. But please realize that no path guarantee=\r\ns self-realization. They help, but do not guarantee anything. And the only =\r\nmethod of spiritual progress, IMHO, is how much ego has been overcome.\n \nMo=\r\nst people stick to one method. There are exceptions like Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa who tried each path and succeeded. In fact, I believe the logo of Ram=\r\nakrishna mutt employs symbols of each of these paths in it! While each sain=\r\nt is great and one cannot compare them, Ramakrishna was somebody else. His =\r\nlila (play) cannot fully be understood by most people even today, after suc=\r\nh a long time. His lila may in fact continue to play out long after he left=\r\n the body.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI just want to share my personal view on=\r\n the link between the abobe paths and Jyotish. This is not from any classic=\r\n and based on my own intuition.\n \nThe path of karma yoga is seen from the e=\r\nlement of earth. The path of bhakti yoga is seen from the element of water.=\r\n The path of jnaana yoga is seen from the element of fire. The path of raja=\r\n yoga is seen from the element of air. Of course, ether is in all. Ether or=\r\n space is the basis of all yoga.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In JyotishGr=\r\noup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tarun&quot; &lt;tarun.virgo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; a =\r\nvery good mail from your side.\n&gt; \n&gt; you covered all points, \n&gt; \n&gt; including=\r\n the Karma which you mentioned as Arjuna and Krishna&#39;s \n&gt; example and Raja =\r\nJanak\n&gt; \n&gt; Rest sanyas things which you mentioned with examples of Trilinga=\r\n \n&gt; Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa ,Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda)and \n&gt; =\r\nfew others.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritualism of Rajnikant.\n&gt; \n&gt; But What a real spirituali=\r\nsm is still yet to defined....\n&gt; \n&gt; being a sadhu tatva is spiritualism ?? =\r\ndoing karma is spiritualism ??\n&gt; giving teachings is spiritualism ? doing S=\r\nocial service is \n&gt; spiritualism ?? guiding others is spiritualism.?? being=\r\n honest is \n&gt; spiritualism ?? or being a warrior and killing because of dut=\r\nies is \n&gt; spiritualism ?? or taking sanyas is spiritualism ?? or sitting in=\r\n \n&gt; temple and worshipping / doing yajna /doing yoga etc...etc...\n&gt; unlimit=\r\ned things.\n&gt; \n&gt; or not helping people and letting them face the god&#39;s decis=\r\nion is \n&gt; spiritualism.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; as per you ..a self realised person who fin=\r\nally loses ego ( any \n&gt; planet specific ) is lost that time a person is spi=\r\nritual ?? but \n&gt; what does he do finally .....again long list as above. ...=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; you have read Geeta and all other puranas , if you can share few \n&gt; t=\r\nhings from your vast knowledge , it would be great for those who \n&gt; donot u=\r\nnderstands the meaning of spiritualism.\n&gt; \n&gt; But do you agree to me that th=\r\nere are many people who has made it as \n&gt; moeny earning module in western c=\r\nountries..\n&gt; \n&gt; ////\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt m=\r\nake one to \n&gt; certify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; anybody.

Rao&quot; \n=\r\n&gt; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i will say if the person=\r\n is spiritual ...go and do tapasya in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleas=\r\nure world and earning money and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Sitting in pleasure world and earning money is NOT synonymous \n&gt; to &quot;e=\r\nnjoying all world pleasures&quot;. One may be sitting in pleasure \n&gt; world, earn=\r\ning money and engaging externally in various activities, \n&gt; but the mind ma=\r\ny be established in peace and bliss.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A realized person is NOT ide=\r\nntified by the actions he/she engages \n&gt; in. Just as an electric fan contin=\r\nues to turn for a few minutes even \n&gt; after the electricity is turned off, =\r\na realized person who is still \n&gt; in a body continues to engage in actions =\r\nbased on the previous flow. \n&gt; After King Janaka realized Self, he continue=\r\nd as the king of Mithila \n&gt; and did all royal duties. After Krishna made Ar=\r\njuna realize Self, \n&gt; Arjuna fought a war and killed his gurus, brothers, g=\r\nrandfather etc.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One who has not yet realized Self will distinguis=\r\nh between various \n&gt; objects of this dual world and view some as good and s=\r\nome as bad. \n&gt; He/she will try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On =\r\nthe \n&gt; other hand, a realized person sees all people, objects and actions \n=\r\n&gt; of this universe as the same Self and sees no reason to either be \n&gt; attr=\r\nacted to or repelled from anything. His/her actions and \n&gt; inactions are th=\r\nus not based on the principles of attraction and \n&gt; repulsion. They are bas=\r\ned on the previous flow.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Renouncing wife, children, job, money et=\r\nc is an attempt to find \n&gt; true mental renunciation. Renouncing external ob=\r\njects can promote \n&gt; mental renunciation, but not guarantee it. On the othe=\r\nr hand, one \n&gt; can remain in the midst of the material world and all the ex=\r\nternal \n&gt; objects and yet have a perfectly stable, peaceful and blissful mi=\r\nnd \n&gt; that is not attracted to or repelled from any of the objects one is \n=\r\n&gt; surrounded by. For all you know, a big film star like Rajinikanth, \n&gt; who=\r\n makes millions of dollars per movie, surrounded by glamour, \n&gt; money and a=\r\ndulation, may be more detached at the mental level than \n&gt; many yogis in Hi=\r\nmalayas. It is probably true in the case of \n&gt; Rajinikanth.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When =\r\none stays away from objects that may attract one, it is \n&gt; relatively easy =\r\nto overcome attraction temporarily. Whether one can \n&gt; retain that renuncia=\r\ntion when one comes in contact with the objects \n&gt; again or not is a questi=\r\nonmark. On the other hand, to be in contact \n&gt; with the objects that may at=\r\ntract one and yet maintain mental \n&gt; detachment and mental renunciation is =\r\ntougher. It is the true test.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is not out of place to mention a=\r\n small story.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami lived for about 300 years and did un=\r\nbelievable \n&gt; austerities in Kashi. When Ramakrishna Paramahamsa met him in=\r\n Kashi, \n&gt; he remarked to his sishyas that Trilinga Swami was Shiva Himself=\r\n and \n&gt; a fully realized being. Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was not \n&gt;=\r\n with him on that pilgrimage and he made a point to force \n&gt; Narendranath t=\r\no go to Kashi later to have a darshan of Trilinga \n&gt; Swami!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Lahir=\r\ni Mahashaya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was the \n&gt; guru of Para=\r\nmahamsa Yogananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a householder \n&gt; and had a high-pay=\r\ning job. Yet he realized Self. Trilnga Swami spoke \n&gt; little, but he once s=\r\npoke a few words in Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s praise. \n&gt; He said, &quot;The state of mi=\r\nnd I achieved by renouncing everything, \n&gt; Lahiri achieved it while being a=\r\n householder, being in the middle of \n&gt; everything. I bow to him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *         *         *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer=\r\n doesnt make one to \n&gt; certify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiri=\r\ntual.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; anybody. However, those who know some =\r\n\n&gt; astrology can give their views on charts that are shared and \n&gt; discusse=\r\nd publicly. If some people see those views as \n&gt; a &quot;certificates&quot;, it is th=\r\neir perception.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *         *         *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Self-realization =\r\ncan be consistently defined. However, \n&gt; spirituality is tough to define. I=\r\nt will mean different things to \n&gt; different people.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The goal of =\r\nall spiritual journeys is to realize Self, at some \n&gt; time or the other. Ho=\r\nwever, most spiritual journeys of this age do \n&gt; NOT end in Self-realizatio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is limited ego that binds one to a limited existence like a=\r\n \n&gt; body and stops one from realizing the all-pervading true Self. While \n&gt;=\r\n a self-realized person&#39;s ego is completely killed, it is possible to \n&gt; ma=\r\nke partial progress. There are many people, who overcome ego to \n&gt; various =\r\nextents and realize to various degrees that body is \n&gt; temporary and it is =\r\nnot the true self. One can do so by following \n&gt; many spiritual paths, like=\r\n the path of knowledge, the path of \n&gt; devotion, the path of pranayama, the=\r\n path of hatha yoga, the path of \n&gt; work and service etc. One who overcomes=\r\n ego to some extent, using \n&gt; any path, is making some spiritual progress. =\r\nWhen the ego is \n&gt; completely subdued, one realizes the true Self. This rea=\r\nlization is \n&gt; the same irrespective of the path followed. However, interme=\r\ndiate \n&gt; steps look and feel different based on the path.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Enough =\r\nof my 2 cents for tonight...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do Ganap=\r\nathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Prashant ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my v=\r\niew, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to \n&gt; certify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrsons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many factors =\r\nwhich one over looks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and in true sense ....what is the rea=\r\nl spiritualism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...go=\r\n and do tapasya in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world and earni=\r\nng money and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarun\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0230_01C89CE2.4683E4D0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3314&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n Sir,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; &gt; But What a real spiritualism is sti=\r\nll yet \nto defined....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I will try more.

One \nmay be sit=\r\nting in pleasure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world, earning money and engaging externally \nin =\r\nvarious activities, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but the mind may be established in peace and \n=\r\nbliss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A realized person is NOT identified=\r\n by \nthe actions he/she engages &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in. Just as an electric fan contin=\r\nues to \nturn for a few minutes even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; after the electricity is turne=\r\nd off, a \nrealized person who is still &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a body continues to enga=\r\nge in actions \nbased on the previous flow. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; After King Janaka reali=\r\nzed Self, he \ncontinued as the king of Mithila &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and did all royal d=\r\nuties. After \nKrishna made Arjuna realize Self, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Arjuna fought a wa=\r\nr and killed his \ngurus, brothers, grandfather etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; One who has \nnot yet realized Self will distinguish between vario=\r\nus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; objects of this \ndual world and view some as good and some as b=\r\nad. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He/she will try to \nstay away from so-called bad actions. On t=\r\nhe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; other hand, a realized \nperson sees all people, objects and act=\r\nions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of this universe as the \nsame Self and sees no reason to eith=\r\ner be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; attracted to or repelled from \nanything. His/her actions and=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; inactions are thus not based on the \nprinciples of attraction and=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; repulsion. They are based on the previous \nflow.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbs=\r\np; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Renouncing wife, children, job, money etc \nis an attempt t=\r\no find &lt;BR&gt;&gt; true mental renunciation. Renouncing external \nobjects can =\r\npromote &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental renunciation, but not guarantee it. On the \nother h=\r\nand, one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can remain in the midst of the material world and all \nth=\r\ne external &lt;BR&gt;&gt; objects and yet have a perfectly stable, peaceful and \n=\r\nblissful mind &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that is not attracted to or repelled from any of the=\r\n \nobjects one is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; surrounded by. For all you know, a big film star =\r\nlike \nRajinikanth, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who makes millions of dollars per movie, surrou=\r\nnded by \nglamour, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; money and adulation, may be more detached at the=\r\n mental level \nthan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; many yogis in Himalayas. It is probably true i=\r\nn the case of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajinikanth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When =\r\none stays away from \nobjects that may attract one, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; relativel=\r\ny easy to overcome \nattraction temporarily. Whether one can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; retain=\r\n that renunciation when \none comes in contact with the objects &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aga=\r\nin or not is a questionmark. \nOn the other hand, to be in contact &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nwith the objects that may attract \none and yet maintain mental &lt;BR&gt;&gt; det=\r\nachment and mental renunciation is \ntougher. It is the true test.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is not out of \nplace to mention a small story.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami \nlived for about 300 years a=\r\nnd did unbelievable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; austerities in Kashi. \nWhen Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa met him in Kashi, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; he remarked to his \nsishyas that Trilinga =\r\nSwami was Shiva Himself and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a fully realized \nbeing. Narendranath =\r\n(Swami Vivekananda) was not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with him on that \npilgrimage and he ma=\r\nde a point to force &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narendranath to go to Kashi \nlater to have a d=\r\narshan of Trilinga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Lahiri=\r\n Mahashaya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nguru o=\r\nf Paramahamsa Yogananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a householder &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and \nh=\r\nad a high-paying job. Yet he realized Self. Trilnga Swami spoke &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nl=\r\nittle, but he once spoke a few words in Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s praise. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n He \nsaid, &quot;The state of mind I achieved by renouncing everything, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Lahiri \nachieved it while being a householder, being in the middle of &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; \neverything.

However, those who know \nsome &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; astrology can give their views on charts that are shared and \n&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; discussed publicly. If some people see those views as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a \n&quot;certi=\r\nficates&quot;, it is their perception.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Self-realization can=\r\n be consistently defined. However, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nspirituality is tough to defin=\r\ne. It will mean different things to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \ndifferent people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The goal of all spiritual \njourneys is to realize Sel=\r\nf, at some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time or the other. However, most \nspiritual journeys of=\r\n this age do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; NOT end in Self-realization.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; It is limited ego that binds one to a limited existence \nlike a &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; body and stops one from realizing the all-pervading true Self. \nWhi=\r\nle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a self-realized person&#39;s ego is completely killed, it is possib=\r\nle \nto &lt;BR&gt;&gt; make partial progress. There are many people, who overcome =\r\nego to \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; various extents and realize to various degrees that body i=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \ntemporary and it is not the true self. One can do so by followi=\r\nng &lt;BR&gt;&gt; many \nspiritual paths, like the path of knowledge, the path of =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; devotion, the \npath of pranayama, the path of hatha yoga, the path=\r\n of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; work and service \netc. One who overcomes ego to some extent, u=\r\nsing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; any path, is making \nsome spiritual progress. When the ego is=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; completely subdued, one \nrealizes the true Self. This realization=\r\n is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the same irrespective of \nthe path followed. However, intermed=\r\niate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; steps look and feel different \nbased on the path.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Enough of my 2 cents for \ntonight...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbs=\r\np; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n=\r\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=\r\nam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A=\r\n \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Sri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n--------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Prashant ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt \nmake one to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ce=\r\nrtify any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good \nand spiritual.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many \nfactors which on=\r\ne over looks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and \nin true se=\r\nnse ....what is the real spiritualism.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...go and do tapasya \nin&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world and earning \nm=\r\noney and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; \n&gt; Tarun&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0230_01C89CE2.4683E4D0--\r\n\n"}}
