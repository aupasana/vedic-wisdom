I recommen=\r\nd preferring normal devatas to astra devatas (deities who personify weapons=\r\n).\n=C2=A0\nDevatas like Mahasudarshana and Pratyangira are personifications =\r\nof weapons. Their sadhanas are akin to taking a weapon and using it. When o=\r\nne takes a weapon, one can either do a ceremonial pooja to it and put it ba=\r\nck or actually use it to solve problems. Though homas and poojas to astra d=\r\nevatas were akin to the latter in old days, they are akin to the former now=\r\n-a-days. In the old days, detached sadhakas of a high caliber existed in th=\r\ne priest class and they used to do homas and poojas to astra devatas like M=\r\nahasudarsana and Pratyangira and produced results quickly. Though most prie=\r\nsts of today are only capable of doing an aayudha pooja rather than using t=\r\nhe aayudha, they nevertheless instinctively go for these poojas based on th=\r\ne old habits. However, based on the changed capabilities, one should change=\r\n the strategy.\n\nJust as a son who is troubled by bullies at school is bette=\r\nr off complaining to mother or father and let them take care of the problem=\r\n, instead of taking the weapon of mother or father and trying to use it one=\r\nself, my humble opinion is that worship of deities who hold those weapons i=\r\ns better today than worship of deities personifying weapons, to solve serio=\r\nus problems.\n\nFor countering black magic, I suggest doing Rahu-Ketu homam o=\r\nr Chandi homam or Narasimha homam. Narasimha homam with &quot;ugram veeram&quot; mant=\r\nra may be a good idea. For removing black magic, homam or worship of Dattat=\r\nreya is also a good idea.\n\nIf you want the specific material result of remo=\r\nving black magic, maintain physical purity around you when you do homam. Of=\r\nfer black sesame seeds in homam. If you have a pomegranate tree near you, o=\r\nffering pomegranate flowers in homam is a good idea. Put a full lime (green=\r\n) everyday as poornaahuti and make sure it burns fully by putting enough fu=\r\nel (wood/coconut/ ghee) along with it. You may need to offer more ghee a fe=\r\nw times as poornaahuti burnas, to make it burn fully. Also, in the sankalpa=\r\n of the homam, you may add &quot;maamuddishya kR^itebhyaH abhicaaraadi prayogebh=\r\nyo bhaavita pIDaayaaH upashamanaarthaM&quot; (in ITrans transliteration) after &quot;=\r\nso and so devataa prasaada siddhyartham&quot; that appears in the Sankalpa in th=\r\ne manuals.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Fri, 1/22/10, prm7782 &lt;prm7782@yahoo. com=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: prm7782 &lt;prm7782@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] which =\r\nhomam to choose?\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Friday, January 2=\r\n2, 2010, 5:05 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nWhich homam works best for getting rid of black=\r\n magic?
