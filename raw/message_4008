As guided by you and Raj=\r\narshi I started reciting the Chandi Path every day (a few chapters at first=\r\n, then end to end recently) and by the blessings of the mother I am now abl=\r\ne to complete the entire recitation within 2 hours. I am planning to start =\r\ndoing Chandi Homam regularly(at least once a month) starting this Sunday, m=\r\nother willing. I pray to the mother and Request your well wishes along with=\r\n all the other Chandi sadhakas in this group to help me in successfully com=\r\nplete this great task.\n\nComing to the Chandi Homam Manual I had the followi=\r\nng queries:-\n1) In the poornahuti Section here, it seems to be a shortened =\r\none compared to the Ganapathi Homam. Is there any specific reason why we ha=\r\nve left out the &quot;poornamidhah purnamidham ---purnamevavahshistye&quot; mantra ?\n=\r\nAlso shoudnt we add the navarna mantra and add &quot;poornahutim samarpayami&quot; li=\r\nke in Ganapathi Homam?\n\n2) Also there is no Tarpanam mentioned in the Chand=\r\ni Homam. Any reason why so?\n\nEagerly waiting for your replies.\n\nThanks and =\r\nRegards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
