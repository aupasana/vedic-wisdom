This came from the \ncontext of Rajarshi&#39;s comments on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \nRamakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding their attitude towards Tantra). He \ncompared them with Vimalananda and said their spiritual caliber was of \nthe scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was 2 power 16. He also talked about \nthe hierarchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 \ncents of musings on that.\n\n-------------------------------\nMeasuring Spiritual Caliber\n\nRajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple of days \nback on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \nflowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \nwhich is a better flower. They have different properties like color, \nsize, shape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative \nvalues depend on the purpose and they cannot be quantified universally. \nHow can any sane person then say that spiritual caliber of different \npeople can be compared and quanitified? The field of duality has \ninfinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi has infinite aspects \nto it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a person as one \nnumber and compare them.\n\nBefore one even attempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist \nin scriptures for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \nwhere Vishnu is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where \nShiva is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \nsupreme. And so on. None of them is absolute. All of them are relative \nand for specific purposes, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are \npeople who take them as absolute and argue that so and so thing taught \nby Vishnu is superior to so and so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \nknow that none of the hierarchies is absolute.\n\nOne who has the nerve to think that one can compare the wisdom of \nJnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakrishna \nParamahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi Sai, \nspiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya, \ndetachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath \nMaharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, \nis a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific \nlimited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \nanother Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \non. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \nYou should just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \nof them that you like the most.\n\nVimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from specific perspective. More \nimportantly, his words should make one realize that there is always \nscope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery over the field \nof duality) while one is still embodied. One should never rest and \naspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to \njudge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements like \n&quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and thinking \nthat something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have \nsaid that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise.\n\nEven if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume \nthat you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \nRamakrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \nper Vimalananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \nOr may be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \nthe details we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \nstature based on his own classification?\n\nYou said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n= say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably made this statement based on \nwhat you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the sake of argument, it is \nnot even 100% clear whether he was a real person or an imagined \ncharacter. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!) left the latter \noption open in the preface of his Aghora book!\n\nIf we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a \nsimpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \none&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \ntold Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \nback, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \none more birth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \nthe other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \nwaiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \nAbhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda!\n\nAgain, please note that this is just one definition. One can have many \ndefinitions. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \nhierarchies and say that &quot;X is weightier than Y and so what he said must \nbe more correct&quot;.\n\nPeople with lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \nto be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \nare doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \nbooks. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as \nabsolute. Written words are always relative and never absolute. \nDiscriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully \nusing experencial realization later on.\n\nMore importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we should \nnot commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments of greats \nwho did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us.\n-------------------------------\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
