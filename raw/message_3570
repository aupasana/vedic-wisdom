It is a different path from most others which=\r\n call the world as maya and body consciousness as something to be forgotten=\r\n or gotten rid of. \n\nOur physical body as such is not plastic enough. The n=\r\nature of Universe or the expression of consciousness (Divine Mother) is con=\r\nstant change / progress. So the body has to die and soul housed in a new fo=\r\nrm as time progresses. All Rishis / Naths do not live for ever in the same =\r\nmaterial body as ours. Either their body is transformed or they will have t=\r\no lose their body after some time. By power of yoga one can prolong existin=\r\ng body into several centuries or even few thousand years, but that body wil=\r\nl still be mortal. The necessary condition for that is the matter that form=\r\ns the body regaining its consciousness and becomes totally fluid - a body o=\r\nf light can be immortal as it can modify itself as per the flow of the guid=\r\ning consciousness. So there will not be a necessity to break that form and =\r\ncreate another new form. It can simply transform. That is the essense (atle=\r\nast in my understanding) of what Sri Aurobindo refers to as physical immort=\r\nality. He and\n the Mother have explained it more clearly in some other plac=\r\nes but I am not able to find it now. \n\nAs per Sri Aurobindo, there has been=\r\n few being who might have attained Supramental descent and even partial tra=\r\nnsformation personally but not the full supramental transformation. Besides=\r\n, as per him, unless the transformation is collective, individual transform=\r\nation is not perfect. \n\nSupramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja=\r\n Samadhi. In Sahaja Samadhi, one consciously functions from a state of Brah=\r\nman, but body still is unconscious for most part, subject to laws of nature=\r\n and they remain mostly detached from the body consciousness (Eg. Ramana Ma=\r\nharishi). A person in Sahaja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk=\r\n. His/her body will also be transformed to some extent to host the immense =\r\nshakthi and vibration of the enlightened person, but that is a far cry from=\r\n what Sri Aurobindo calls as Supramental transformation. \n\nHowever, in Supr=\r\namental transformation, the matter of the body _also_ is transformed to exp=\r\nress the Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness. There are lots of other things too =\r\nother than body transformation. \n\nIf you have time and are interested, I wo=\r\nuld suggest you read &quot;Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness&quot; by S=\r\natprem. It is a not a large book but may take a loong time to read and assi=\r\nmilate. It very lucidly and clearly delineates different stages of consciou=\r\nsness from a very practical standpoint, starting with body consciousness to=\r\n vital, mental, intellectual and higher regions of consciousness. It is a u=\r\nnique biography which deals not with mundane life details of the subject, b=\r\nut his journey through consciousness and while doing that explains various =\r\nfiner stages and aspects of consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biogr=\r\naphies of other Masters are written in that way, it would be amazing. \n\nWha=\r\nt ever I said on this topic is _very crude_ and does not do justice to the =\r\ntopic at all. I really mean it. I have oversimplified for the sake of the p=\r\nost. This topic needs a very subtle and sublime treatment stemming at least=\r\n in part from corresponding inner experiences & realizations which I am not=\r\n capable of at present. The best I can do is point to those that have done =\r\nit. Once &quot;Sri Aurobindo or adventure of Consciousness&quot; is read, then all of=\r\n Sri Aurobindo&#39;s works and what he says about Supramental descent and trans=\r\nformation can be comprehended more easily. Alternately one can start with t=\r\nhe works of M.P. Pandit as well. Shri. Pandit&#39;s writings are very lucid, pr=\r\nofound and illuminating.\n\nBTW, I read with interest your thread &quot;Rama Nam S=\r\natha Hai&quot;. Thanks for sharing.\n\nWarm regards,\nShiva.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Shiva,\n&gt;=\r\n =E0=B8=A2=C2=A0\n&gt; Here is a quote from Sri Aurobindo&#39;s own writings on Sup=\r\nramental Descent mentioned in his book on Integral Yoga.\n&gt; =E0=B8=A2=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;The change of consciousness is a necessary thing and without it there co=\r\nuld be no physical siddhi.

If these are=\r\n to remain the descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a chang=\r\ne of consciousness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divin=\r\ne, the Overmind is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supr=\r\namental Descent is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, v=\r\nital and body. This would imply as=E0=B8=A2=C2=A0a final result the disappe=\r\narence of the unconsciousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to=\r\n death or disease. That would mean it would not be subject to ordinary proc=\r\nesses by which death comes. If a change in the body had to be made, it woul=\r\nd be by the will of the inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical\n&gt;=\r\n immortality. If someone wanted to live 1000 years or more, then supposing =\r\none had the complete siddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be no im=\r\nmortality of the body without supramentalization. &quot;\n&gt; =E0=B8=A2=C2=A0\n&gt; Aga=\r\nin at another place Sri Aurobindo states that immoratlity is not the aim of=\r\n Supramental Descent, but one of the possibilities.\n&gt; =E0=B8=A2=C2=A0\n&gt; I d=\r\nid not quite understand, what exactly is this Supramental Descent, if it ha=\r\ns nothing to do with physical immortality. Because, connecting the and upli=\r\nfting the ordinary mind to the state of divinity and functioning from that =\r\nsphere is something that most self realized Yogis do. Then how is &quot;Supramen=\r\ntal Descent&quot; so unique?\n&gt; =E0=B8=A2=C2=A0\n&gt; Again if, as we see from the ab=\r\nove writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken off, that woul=\r\nd mean also a transformation of the body. \n&gt; =E0=B8=A2=C2=A0\n&gt; Well, the Na=\r\nths(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane.

Immediately upon my\n&gt; &gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual a=\r\ntmosphere of the place. On August\n&gt; &gt; 15th of that year, I had my first dar=\r\nshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of\n&gt; &gt; three times in a year that he ga=\r\nve darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother\n&gt; &gt; to be powerful spiritual p=\r\nersonalities, as they seemed to have the ability\n&gt; &gt; to work on the develop=\r\nment of their disciples in a silent and invisible\n&gt; &gt; manner. All of Aurobi=\r\nndo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his or the\n&gt; &gt; Mother&#39;s power as=\r\n spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kap=\r\nali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; &gt; disciple of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni=\r\n. As he was now and then\n&gt; &gt; visiting Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe t=\r\no me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; &gt; ashrama. His intriguing descriptions, along w=\r\nith the reading of B. V.\n&gt; &gt; Narasimhaswami&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, i=\r\ns what prompted my first visit\n&gt; &gt; to Ramanasramam in 1933.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before=\r\n this second visit to Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagavan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; biograp=\r\nhy. In it I found a passage relating to the possibility of changing\n&gt; &gt; one=\r\n&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it to the Maharshi. He\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntold me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What of that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIn Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulated and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into town we had to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it was totally\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, informality and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the same time elevating.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally permitted to=\r\n visit all\n&gt; &gt; other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Maharsh=\r\ni and Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the power=\r\n to undo years\n&gt; &gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo w=\r\nere effecting on the\n&gt; &gt; psyche of their followers. In other words, they co=\r\nnsidered the Maharshi too\n&gt; &gt; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was aware of =\r\nthis and once when I was alone\n&gt; &gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of tha=\r\nt place. They are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I had been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those year=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; they showered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the spir=\r\nitual\n&gt; &gt; path. My gratitude and regard for them compelled me to obtain the=\r\nir\n&gt; &gt; permission and blessings before leaving. This turned out to be much =\r\nmore\n&gt; &gt; difficult than I imagined.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo Ashram, it was th=\r\ne practice of the disciples who had doubts or\n&gt; &gt; questions to write them i=\r\nn the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the\n&gt; &gt; letters were daily col=\r\nlected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with the\n&gt; &gt; Mother during the=\r\n nights and promptly answer them in writing. Sometimes we\n&gt; &gt; would see the=\r\n lights burning all night as they were engaged in this work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Upon =\r\nmy return from Ramanasramam I wrote a letter stating my desire to\n&gt; &gt; recei=\r\nve their blessings and permission to live at Ramanasramam. In the\n&gt; &gt; lette=\r\nr to Aurobindo I wrote that since your yoga begins with\n&gt; &gt; Self-realizatio=\r\nn, kindly permit me to go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes\n&gt; &gt; only Self-r=\r\nealization, a state I have not attained, or may not even be\n&gt; &gt; worthy of a=\r\nttaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but negative in\n&gt; &gt; regards t=\r\no my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-realization and the\n&gt; &gt; supra=\r\n-mental state can be simultaneously developed and achieved here. There\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nis no need for you to go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was extremely disappointed at h=\r\nis response and consequently became\n&gt; &gt; frustrated, restless and discourage=\r\nd. I soon began to have sleepless nights\n&gt; &gt; and felt distraught. I then wr=\r\note a second letter to Aurobindo with the same\n&gt; &gt; request. Again I was den=\r\nied permission. It took a long five months and a\n&gt; &gt; third letter before Au=\r\nrobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their\n&gt; &gt; permission and b=\r\nlessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and\n&gt; &gt; they saw no =\r\nother recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final lette=\r\nr to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\n&gt; &gt; follow a path in which y=\r\nou can achieve only partial realization, we give you\n&gt; &gt; our blessings, tho=\r\nugh we believe it would be better if you stayed on here\n&gt; &gt; and pursued you=\r\nr sadhana where both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was the ru=\r\nle in Aurobindo Ashram that any letter written to or received\n&gt; &gt; from Auro=\r\nbindo should not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this\n&gt; &gt; rul=\r\ne, I burnt all my letters, except the final letter I received from\n&gt; &gt; Auro=\r\nbindo. This I kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Settli=\r\nng at Sri Ramanasramam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During the early years there were no houses=\r\n anywhere near the ashram, as it\n&gt; &gt; was mostly jungle or forest. I eventua=\r\nlly found an upstairs room in a\n&gt; &gt; brahmin&#39;s house near the Arunachala Tem=\r\nple in town. For my meals I would\n&gt; &gt; sometimes cook small items in my room=\r\n, sometimes obtain food from somewhere\n&gt; &gt; outside, and somehow manage with=\r\nout feeling inconvenienced.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m=\r\n., walk to the ashram, stay in the\n&gt; &gt; hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., re=\r\nturn to my room, come back again to the\n&gt; &gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there=\r\n until 8 p.m. It went on like this during the\n&gt; &gt; first year. If possible, =\r\nI would always sit close to Bhagavan so I could\n&gt; &gt; hear all of his preciou=\r\ns utterances.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Auro=\r\nbindo, decided that the\n&gt; &gt; Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness.=\r\n Consequently, one day he\n&gt; &gt; travelled to Pondicherry and while there wrot=\r\ne a note to Aurobindo\n&gt; &gt; describing who he was, what he wanted from life (=\r\nSelf-realization) and where\n&gt; &gt; he was then residing (Sri Ramanasramam) . C=\r\nohen later showed me the reply he\n&gt; &gt; got from Aurobindo. It said, in brief=\r\n, that all his aspirations could be\n&gt; &gt; fulfilled at Sri Ramanasramam, wher=\r\ne he was then living.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I remember during my second visit to Ramanas=\r\nramam the Maharshi was one day\n&gt; &gt; reading a lengthy book review from a new=\r\nspaper. The book being reviewed was\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The rev=\r\niewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of\n&gt; &gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s=\r\n devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take\n&gt; &gt; great interest in the r=\r\neview and would occasionally stop reading and comment\n&gt; &gt; on what he had ju=\r\nst read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded\n&gt; &gt; reading it, =\r\nsomeone who was aware that I had that very book with me, said to\n&gt; &gt; Bhagav=\r\nan, &quot;This man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nith him.&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; look at it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed=\r\n it over to Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. H=\r\ne kept on reading it well\n&gt; &gt; into the night, with the help of a small oil =\r\nlamp, until he finished it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I came into the hall the next day=\r\n he began discussing the book with me,\n&gt; &gt; telling me that a certain term u=\r\nsed in the book might look like something\n&gt; &gt; new, but it is actually the e=\r\nquivalent of this other term used in such and\n&gt; &gt; such ancient text, etc. L=\r\nike this, he went on discussing and comparing\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy fo=\r\nr some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy bo=\r\nth intellectually and also from the standpoint of\n&gt; &gt; experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOne evening I said to Bhagavan that the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n teachings is that it professes that immortality of the body can be achieve=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan made no comment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The next day, as soon as I walked=\r\n into the hall and sat down, Bhagavan\n&gt; &gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;I=\r\nn Kumbhakonam there was one yogi, C. V. V.\n&gt; &gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to =\r\nall, his doctrine of the immortality of the\n&gt; &gt; body. He was even so bold a=\r\ns to declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a\n&gt; &gt; distinguished public and spiritua=\r\nl personality in India) would have to come\n&gt; &gt; to him to learn how to make =\r\nher body immortal. But, before he had a chance\n&gt; &gt; to meet Dr. Annie Besant=\r\n, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illustrated his\n&gt; &gt; point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On=\r\n another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ramanasramam, I\n&gt; &gt; appr=\r\noached Bhagavan when no one was in the hall and showed him that last\n&gt; &gt; le=\r\ntter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to give it to him to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwriting=\r\n, as\n&gt; &gt; it was very illegible and only those who have studied it for somet=\r\nime could\n&gt; &gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After=\r\n looking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\neturned it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; to the sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which yo=\r\nu can\n&gt; &gt; achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and =\r\nsaid,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, an=\r\nd if it is\n&gt; &gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This was the final=\r\n blow that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this\n&gt; &gt; letter, like a=\r\nll the rest. And because of all the discussions I had had with\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan=\r\n I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, having a clear\n&gt; &gt; und=\r\nerstanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts and distractions\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then knew that I understood and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the foundation work had been done. The purpose of all our discussions =\r\nwere\n&gt; &gt; served and so they stopped automatically.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe the m=\r\nost unique characteristic of Bhagavan was the power of his\n&gt; &gt; presence. Mu=\r\nch of what he taught had already been transmitted to the masses\n&gt; &gt; down th=\r\nrough the ages. In Bhagavan we found a being that was surcharged with\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe Reality to such an extent that coming into his presence would effect a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; dramatic change in us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sources:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a) http://www.arunacha=\r\n la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmay-jun\n&gt; &gt; b) http://www.arunacha la.org/=\r\nnewslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmar-apr\n&gt; &gt; c) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslett=\r\ne rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-aug\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=\r\n=93`&quot;=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0&#39; =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=98=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD =E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9D=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=87=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=81=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=\r\n=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=E2=80=94 =E0=B8=B1=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD =E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B8=B0=E0=B8=93=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=EF=\r\n=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9F\n&gt; &gt; =E0=B8=B1=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9A=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=\r\n=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=\r\n=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=82=\r\n=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0&#39;=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=\r\n=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD =\r\n=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=8C=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&quot;=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=\r\n=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0&#39;=\r\n=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=\r\n=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0&#39;\n&gt; &gt; =E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9A=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=E2=80=94=E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=E2=80=94 =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=A2=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=\r\n=B8=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=81=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=\r\n=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0`\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8.=\r\n Get it NOW! http://downloads. yahoo.com/ in/internetexplo rer/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n      Your Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8.

It is a diff=\r\nerent path from most others which call the world as maya and body conscious=\r\nness as something to be forgotten or gotten rid of. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our physical bo=\r\ndy as such is not plastic enough. The nature of Universe or the expression =\r\nof consciousness (Divine Mother) is constant change / progress. So the body=\r\n has to die and soul housed in a new form as time progresses. All Rishis / =\r\nNaths do not live for ever in the same material body as ours. Either their =\r\nbody is transformed or they will have to lose their body after some time. B=\r\ny power of yoga one can prolong existing body into several centuries or eve=\r\nn few thousand years, but that body will still be mortal. The necessary con=\r\ndition for that is the matter that forms the body regaining its consciousne=\r\nss and becomes totally fluid - a body of light\n can be immortal as it can m=\r\nodify itself as per the flow of the guiding consciousness. So there will no=\r\nt be a necessity to break that form and create another new form. It can sim=\r\nply transform. That is the essense (atleast in my understanding) of what Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo refers to as physical immortality. He and the Mother have expla=\r\nined it more clearly in some other places but I am not able to find it now.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As per Sri Aurobindo, there has been few being who might have atta=\r\nined Supramental descent and even partial transformation personally but not=\r\n the full supramental transformation. Besides, as per him, unless the trans=\r\nformation is collective, individual transformation is not perfect. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSupramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja Samadhi. In Sahaja Sama=\r\ndhi, one consciously functions from a state of Brahman, but body still is u=\r\nnconscious for most part, subject to laws of nature and they remain mostly =\r\ndetached from the body consciousness\n (Eg. Ramana Maharishi). A person in S=\r\nahaja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk. His/her body will als=\r\no be transformed to some extent to host the immense shakthi and vibration o=\r\nf the enlightened person, but that is a far cry from what Sri Aurobindo cal=\r\nls as Supramental transformation. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, in Supramental transform=\r\nation, the matter of the body _also_ is transformed to express the Sat-Chit=\r\n-Ananda consciousness. There are lots of other things too other than body t=\r\nransformation. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have time and are interested, I would suggest=\r\n you read &quot;Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness&quot; by Satprem. It =\r\nis a not a large book but may take a loong time to read and assimilate. It =\r\nvery lucidly and clearly delineates different stages of consciousness from =\r\na very practical standpoint, starting with body consciousness to vital, men=\r\ntal, intellectual and higher regions of consciousness. It is a unique biogr=\r\naphy which deals not with\n mundane life details of the subject, but his jou=\r\nrney through consciousness and while doing that explains various finer stag=\r\nes and aspects of consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biographies of =\r\nother Masters are written in that way, it would be amazing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What ev=\r\ner I said on this topic is _very crude_ and does not do justice to the topi=\r\nc at all. I really mean it. I have oversimplified for the sake of the post.=\r\n This topic needs a very subtle and sublime treatment stemming at least in =\r\npart from corresponding inner experiences &amp; realizations which I am not=\r\n capable of at present. The best I can do is point to those that have done =\r\nit. Once &quot;Sri Aurobindo or adventure of Consciousness&quot; is read, then all of=\r\n Sri Aurobindo&#39;s works and what he says about Supramental descent and trans=\r\nformation can be comprehended more easily. Alternately one can start with t=\r\nhe works of M.P. Pandit as well. Shri. Pandit&#39;s writings are very lucid, pr=\r\nofound and\n illuminating.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, I read with interest your thread &quot;Ram=\r\na Nam Satha Hai&quot;.

If these are to remain the descent of the supramental is hardly necessa=\r\nry - for a change of\n consciousness which would mean mental - spiritual uni=\r\non with the Divine, the Overmind is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is suf=\r\nficient. The Supramental Descent is necessary for the dynamic action of the=\r\n Truth in mind, vital and body. This would imply as=E0=B8=A2&nbsp;a final r=\r\nesult the disappearence of the unconsciousness of the body; it would no lon=\r\nger be subject to death or disease. That would mean it would not be subject=\r\n to ordinary processes by which death comes. If a change in the body had to=\r\n be made, it would be by the will of the inhabitant. This would be the esse=\r\nnce of physical&lt;BR&gt;&gt; immortality. If someone wanted to live 1000 years o=\r\nr more, then supposing one had the complete siddhi, it would not be impossi=\r\nble. There can be no immortality of the body without supramentalization. &quot;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; =E0=B8=A2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Again at another place Sri Aurobindo states=\r\n that immoratlity is not the aim of Supramental Descent, but one of the pos=\r\nsibilities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n =E0=B8=A2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I did not quite understand, wh=\r\nat exactly is this Supramental Descent, if it has nothing to do with physic=\r\nal immortality. Because, connecting the and uplifting the ordinary mind to =\r\nthe state of divinity and functioning from that sphere is something that mo=\r\nst self realized Yogis do. Then how is &quot;Supramental Descent&quot; so unique?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =E0=B8=A2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Again if, as we see from the above writings, a=\r\n total transformation is what is being spoken off, that would mean also a t=\r\nransformation of the body. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =E0=B8=A2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well, the Naths=\r\n(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane.

Immediately upon my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the place. On Augu=\r\nst&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 15th of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo.=\r\n This was one of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; three times in a year that he gave darshan. I=\r\n found Sri Aurobindo and Mother&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to be powerful spiritual perso=\r\nnalities, as they seemed to have the ability&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to work on the de=\r\nvelopment of their disciples in a silent and invisible&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; manner.=\r\n All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his or the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhile I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; disciple of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; visiting Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharsh=\r\ni and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ashrama. His intriguing descriptions, along with the=\r\n reading of B. V.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Narasimhaswami&#39; s biography of the Maharshi=\r\n, is what prompted my first visit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to Ramanasramam in 1933.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Before this second visit to Ramanasramam I once aga=\r\nin read Bhagavan&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; biography. In it I found a passage relating=\r\n to the possibility of changing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt abou=\r\nt this and addressed it to the Maharshi. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Cer=\r\ntainly. One can change his guru. What of that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nIn Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulated and&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into town =\r\nwe had to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam=\r\n it was totally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling =\r\nof freedom, informality and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spontaneity. Everything was so nat=\r\nural and at the same time elevating.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, in Au=\r\nrobindo Ashrama,\n disciples were generally permitted to visit all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Maharshi and Sri&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the power t=\r\no undo years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Auro=\r\nbindo were effecting on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; psyche of their followers. In othe=\r\nr words, they considered the Maharshi too&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; powerful an influenc=\r\ne. Bhagavan was aware of this and once when I was alone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with h=\r\nim he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. They are afraid of me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I ha=\r\nd been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; they showered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the =\r\nspiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; path. My gratitude and regard for them compelled me =\r\nto obtain their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; permission and blessings before leaving. This =\r\nturned out\n to be much more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult than I imagined.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo Ashram, it was the practice of the discipl=\r\nes who had doubts or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; questions to write them in the form of a =\r\nletter to Sri Aurobindo. All the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; letters were daily collected =\r\nand taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mother during t=\r\nhe nights and promptly answer them in writing. Sometimes we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wo=\r\nuld see the lights burning all night as they were engaged in this work.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote a letter s=\r\ntating my desire to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; receive their blessings and permission to =\r\nlive at Ramanasramam. In the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that =\r\nsince your yoga begins with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me=\r\n to go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; only Self-realization=\r\n, a state I have not attained, or may not even be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; worthy of\n a=\r\nttaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but negative in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nregards to my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-realization and the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; supra-mental state can be simultaneously developed and achieve=\r\nd here. There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was extremely disappointed at his response and consequently b=\r\necame&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; frustrated, restless and discouraged. I soon began to ha=\r\nve sleepless nights&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and felt distraught. I then wrote a second=\r\n letter to Aurobindo with the same&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; request. Again I was denied=\r\n permission. It took a long five months and a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; third letter bef=\r\nore Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; p=\r\nermission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; they saw no other recourse but to grant my request.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final letter to me he wrote, &quot;Since\n you are=\r\n determined to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; follow a path in which you can achieve only par=\r\ntial realization, we give you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our blessings, though we believe=\r\n it would be better if you stayed on here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and pursued your sad=\r\nhana where both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nIt was the rule in Aurobindo Ashram that any letter written to or received&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; from Aurobindo should not leave the ashram premises. So, to co=\r\nmply with this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rule, I burnt all my letters, except the final =\r\nletter I received from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Aurobindo. This I kept with the view of=\r\n showing it to Bhagavan.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Settling at Sri Ramanas=\r\nramam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; During the early years there were no house=\r\ns anywhere near the ashram, as it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was mostly jungle or forest.=\r\n I eventually found an upstairs room in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; brahmin&#39;s house near=\r\n the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; sometime=\r\ns cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashr=\r\nam, stay in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my=\r\n room, come back again to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there =\r\nuntil 8 p.m. It went on like this during the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; first year. If po=\r\nssible, I would always sit close to Bhagavan so I could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hear a=\r\nll of his precious utterances.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; S. S. Cohen, afte=\r\nr repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yog=\r\ni from Pondicherry must have some greatness. Consequently, one day he&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; travelled to Pondicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; describing who he was, what he wanted from life (Self-realizat=\r\nion) and where&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he was then residing (Sri\n Ramanasramam) . Cohe=\r\nn later showed me the reply he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; got from Aurobindo. It said, in=\r\n brief, that all his aspirations could be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fulfilled at Sri Ram=\r\nanasramam, where he was then living.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I remember =\r\nduring my second visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; reading a lengthy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed w=\r\nas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri =\r\nand the editor of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M.=\r\n Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; great interest in the review =\r\nand would occasionally stop reading and comment&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on what he had=\r\n just read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nreading it, someone who was aware that I had that very book with me, said t=\r\no&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhagavan, &quot;This man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and h=\r\ne has that book&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with him.&quot;\n Bhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;O=\r\nh, is that so? Let me have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; look at it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over to Bhaga=\r\nvan.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He kept o=\r\nn reading it well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; into the night, with the help of a small oil=\r\n lamp, until he finished it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When I came into th=\r\ne hall the next day he began discussing the book with me,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tell=\r\ning me that a certain term used in the book might look like something&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; new, but it is actually the equivalent of this other term used in s=\r\nuch and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; such ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussi=\r\nng and comparing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhaga=\r\nvan thoroughly understood&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellec=\r\ntually and also from the standpoint of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One evening I\n said to Bhagavan that the major attraction o=\r\nf Aurobindo&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; teachings is that it professes that immortality =\r\nof the body can be achieved.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhagavan made no comment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat=\r\n down, Bhagavan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam=\r\n there was one yogi, C. V. V.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all,=\r\n his doctrine of the immortality of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body. He was even so b=\r\nold as to declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; distinguished publi=\r\nc and spiritual personality in India) would have to come&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to hi=\r\nm to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he had a chance&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illust=\r\nrated his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On another day, no=\r\nt too long after settling near Sri Ramanasramam, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; approached =\r\nBhagavan when no one\n was in the hall and showed him that last&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to give it to him =\r\nto&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s=\r\n handwriting, as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it was very illegible and only those who have=\r\n studied it for sometime could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it to m=\r\ne. Let me try.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After looking into it and realiz=\r\ning he could only make out a few words, he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; returned it and ask=\r\ned me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to th=\r\ne sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and =\r\nsaid,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realiz=\r\nation, and if it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This was the final blow that silenced all my doubts. I th=\r\nen destroyed\n this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; letter, like all the rest. And because of a=\r\nll the discussions I had had with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfect=\r\nly established in his teachings, having a clear&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; understanding =\r\nof where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts and distractions&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then knew that I underst=\r\nood and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the foundation work had been done. The purpose of all =\r\nour discussions were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; served and so they stopped automatically.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bha=\r\ngavan was the power of his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; presence. Much of what he taught ha=\r\nd already been transmitted to the masses&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; down through the ages=\r\n. In Bhagavan we found a being that was surcharged with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the Re=\r\nality to such an extent that coming into his presence would effect a&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;\n dramatic change in us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sources:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a) &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.arunacha/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.arunacha&lt;/A&gt; la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmay-jun=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; b) &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.arunacha/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://www.arunacha&lt;/A&gt; la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; c) &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.arunacha/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.arunacha&lt;/A&gt; la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-aug&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`&quot;=E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0&#39; =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=98=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=\r\n=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD =E0=B8=B1=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9D=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=87=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=A2=E0=B8=81=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=E2=80=94 =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=\r\n=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD =E0=B8=B1=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=\r\n=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=\r\n=B8=93=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=EF=BF=BD=E0=\r\n=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9F&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n =E0=B8=\r\n=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9A=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=\r\n=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=\r\n=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=\r\n=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=\r\n=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0&#39;=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=\r\n=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=\r\n=BD =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=8C=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&quot;=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=\r\n=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=\r\n=B0&#39;=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=\r\n=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0&#39;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9A=E0=B8=B1=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=\r\n=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=\r\n=E2=80=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=E2=80=94 =E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=\r\n=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=\r\n=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=EF=BF=BD=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=\r\n=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=82=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0=EF=BF=BD=\r\n=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B9=82=E2=80=A2=E0=B8=81=E0=B8=B1=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=94=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=\r\n=E2=80=93`=E0=B8=B0=E0=B8=9E=E0=B8=B1=E2=82=AC=E0=B9=82=E2=80=93&#39;=E0=B8=B0`=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Your Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimiz=\r\ned IE8.
