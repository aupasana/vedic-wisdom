Ujjain is also famous for =\r\nRaja Bharathat Hari \ncave.\n&gt; Raja Barathari is considered as one of the 9 N=\r\naths from the Nath \n&gt; Sampradaya. He meditated for a long time and then he =\r\nwent south to\n&gt; Devas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop of b=\r\nlood \nfrom \n&gt; Sati when Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse feel in Devas to=\r\no. And \n&gt; in the same place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A lo=\r\nt \nof \n&gt; great Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating there, =\r\n\n&gt; starting with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai and \nthen\n=\r\n&gt; Sheelnath Maharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th \n&gt; centu=\r\nry. Over and above the temple now there is Sheelnath maharaj \n&gt; Dhuni Sanst=\r\nan and also Swami VishnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s Ashram located \nin \n&gt; the valley of=\r\n the hill where Mother Chamunda temple is situated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mother in this tem=\r\nple manifested many times and gave guidance and \n&gt; darshan to all of the ab=\r\nove saints. I am sure there are others who \n&gt; benefited too.\n&gt; \n&gt; They all =\r\nstayed at the Temple in devas. It is said even today many \n&gt; Mahatmas in So=\r\noksma sareer come to pray Chamunda Devi on a regular \n&gt; basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om S=\r\nhaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
