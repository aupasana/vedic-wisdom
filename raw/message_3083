Narasimha,\n    I was giving an explanation from my understanding=\r\n, but it was still at my mental level. The actions of an englightened maste=\r\nr established in Sahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concept=\r\ns of how things should be. \n\n For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of =\r\nthe highest order, ran away from the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Ma=\r\nthura instead of fighting and defeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself year=\r\ns later would advice Arjuna against dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a=\r\n satisfying intellectual answer to it if people raise questions?\n\nSri Aurob=\r\nindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: If Krish=\r\nna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in itself!=\r\n An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more com=\r\nplete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the orig=\r\ninal to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.\n\nAnother instance that co=\r\nmes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big=\r\n nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanimity. Sri Rama=\r\nna was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can intellectually argue th=\r\nat it was his dharma to protect the ashram and inmates from the thieves. \n\n=\r\nBesides, there were certain things that I did not want to put in an public =\r\nemail. \n\nSome clues - AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million people meditati=\r\nng and doing sudarhsn Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There we=\r\nre several threats from certain militants from one community about planting=\r\n bombs or disrupting it in other ways police security provided was not suff=\r\nicient for that sized gathering.\n\nThe concerned debate where lot of SIMI me=\r\nmbers were among the participants happened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 200=\r\n6.\n\nSome people believe Sri Sri&#39;s presence in the event changed the heart o=\r\nf some miscreants.\n\nMany does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings =\r\nwith the future head of state of a superpower few minutes before the meetin=\r\ng was to happen. Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained=\r\n logically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty =\r\nabout an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot cont=\r\nain them in our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is mu=\r\nch higher.\n\nAs the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental under=\r\nstanding, we can maintain a respectable silence about it. \n\nI do not expect=\r\n my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I have said everything I h=\r\nad to say. \n\nIn hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to gi=\r\nve an intellectual explanation for something that I myself have not yet int=\r\nellectually understood.\n\nI did want to object to some statements saying Sri=\r\n Sri did not know what do say or was confused. It was a judgement of those =\r\nwithout any knowledge or understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does=\r\n not understand Sri Krishna might judge him differently for several of His =\r\nacts which could not be intellectually explained. Having observed him in pe=\r\nrson with questions several times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can =\r\nconfidently say that it was not true. \n\nBest regards, \n-Siva. \n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

After all, opponent in a debate is different from a &quot;question=\r\ner&quot; or a disciple seeking spiritual direction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The topic of the mee=\r\nting was something like &quot;Concept of God in\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism and Islam&quot;.

They had the knack of steering the debate in a direct=\r\nion that they wanted - a direction that would help establish sanatana dharm=\r\na. They did not tolerate adharma and ignorance with &quot;polite words&quot;.

In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfoun=\r\nded! How is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively o=\r\nn several scriptures, who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Real=\r\nization and learning, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old=\r\n without anybody teaching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in variou=\r\ns forums across the world on all topics under the sun shy away from explain=\r\ning some simple questions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer=\r\n is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / =\r\nGod is not an article of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Trut=\r\nh to those that are ready. He is not interested in anything else. He answer=\r\ns only when there is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he=\r\n would say some polite words and let it pass, however big the occasion may =\r\nbe. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting were answered el=\r\naborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? Th=\r\ne topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and I=\r\nslam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of t=\r\nhe very thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were =\r\nready to benefit from it from the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n************\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of inte=\r\nrest to everyone, especially those among us that are intellectually curious=\r\n about spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices =\r\n&quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes=\r\n in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri =\r\nwill only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but=\r\n his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are rec=\r\neptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading on=\r\ne mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to =\r\nTruth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Wor=\r\nds are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of word=\r\ns is to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, th=\r\nere is no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immens=\r\ne blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri o=\r\nr someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being inste=\r\nad of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable examples o=\r\nf very simple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big in=\r\ntellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. S=\r\nometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign i=\r\ngnorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it=\r\n would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an ill=\r\niterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at leas=\r\nt a small glimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowled=\r\nge can be very dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept and w=\r\nill actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dang=\r\nerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s e=\r\nmpty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc.=\r\n, stand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jai=\r\n Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajars=\r\nhi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasionally visit t=\r\nhis forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the below email f=\r\nrom Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and=\r\n as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few =\r\nthings to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are severa=\r\nl paths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritual=\r\nistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where t=\r\nhe path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it in any way inferio=\r\nr to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit =\r\npath&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The pe=\r\nrsonality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiates more =\r\nand more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience,=\r\n AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yo=\r\nga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as =\r\nit is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for =\r\ncleansing and settling of the mind and preparing for meditation and doing o=\r\nther spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the=\r\n right attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old p=\r\natterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the b=\r\nody (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salu=\r\ntations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under th=\r\nis category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the prana=\r\nyams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living=\r\n course, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of =\r\nNarada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat G=\r\nita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the =\r\nabove. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publi=\r\ncly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! B=\r\nesides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learni=\r\nng and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to b=\r\necome Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises o=\r\nn Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhaj=\r\nans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder wh=\r\ny AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at=\r\n every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experiences =\r\nthat Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Sama=\r\ndhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every step =\r\nof the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get necess=\r\nary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in person=\r\n and several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inn=\r\ner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the various A=\r\nOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowle=\r\ndge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious inne=\r\nr communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the s=\r\nenior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high orde=\r\nr capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation=\r\n. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels=\r\n of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having=\r\n achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or R=\r\namana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are=\r\n in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its co=\r\nurses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teach=\r\ners nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proc=\r\needs go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the f=\r\null time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth i=\r\nn property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neith=\r\ner needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went=\r\n through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Know=\r\nledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be =\r\nrevealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers =\r\nhave faced danger to their lives by going without any help or guidance to a=\r\nreas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Pale=\r\nstine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as t=\r\nheir aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL course=\r\ns for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that those th=\r\nat paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It is=\r\n Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course beca=\r\nuse they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing sev=\r\neral AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people took courses f=\r\nor free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural di=\r\nsaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AO=\r\nL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does n=\r\not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my unders=\r\ntanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teacher=\r\ns and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and e=\r\nxpress the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one=\r\n follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
