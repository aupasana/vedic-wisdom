Only very adva=\r\nnced sadhakas will be able to identify\n&gt; rnas / karmic debts and know how/w=\r\nhere/why they are to be paid off. The rest\n&gt; of us have to follow dharma, w=\r\nhich includes standing up for what is right\n&gt; and righteous and not being d=\r\nefeatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; have written off the wron=\r\ngs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; Krishna urged him to =\r\ntake up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; mercy. The webs of k=\r\narma are too intricate and complex and delicate to be\n&gt; comprehended unless=\r\n one has reached certain very very high levels of\n&gt; spiritual attainment, a=\r\nnd even then, it will only be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; S/He who is unlimite=\r\nd (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; knows best how to=\r\n dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Aditiji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun co=\r\nuld do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; Arjun was a great sadhaka himself.\n&gt; Wha=\r\nt he did was sort of simple. He did so much sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; =\r\ndeity began to occupy him day and night. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; =\r\nThat in turn gave him the rarest of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n=\r\n&gt; the time of the battle, because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only=\r\n\n&gt; one who knows how to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; =\r\nyourself can you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, at the time of the ba=\r\nttle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; the Viswharoopa somethi=\r\nng crazy happened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; course Krishna was pre=\r\nsent even before, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; properly. this was Kri=\r\nshna&#39;s lila or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; Arjun have treated=\r\n him as a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; playing tricks on Him=\r\n, but the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, now once A=\r\nrjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; Krishna in=\r\n his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; who destr=\r\noyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; This is why at the end of the battle when all the Pand=\r\navas went to ask the\n&gt; person who had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarsh=\r\nana but who was still\n&gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... about who w=\r\nas responsible for the\n&gt; Pandava&#39;s victory.........\n&gt; All that man said was=\r\n that at the beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; Sudarshana start out f=\r\nrom one end of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; that destruction, it=\r\n would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; And the blood whic=\r\nh was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun was lucky=\r\n, He had God incarnate at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; so fortunate.=\r\n For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; blood and=\r\n pus (I left my thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; years ago=\r\n).\n&gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think =\r\nhe was\n&gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; \n&gt; Easiest thing to do =\r\nis Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; freely admitted to the=\r\n Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n&gt; fool and knew nothing=\r\n at all. She taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; Whatever you ever do i=\r\nn life, just try and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; that you have with anyb=\r\nody, give whatever you can, turn away nobody from\n&gt; your door, who knows wh=\r\nen God will come to test you?\n&gt; \n&gt; This does not mean that one is fatalisti=\r\nc and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; that terrific sadhana is useful, nay eve=\r\nn necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhana and a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-remov=\r\nes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; cha Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being), are es=\r\nsential. Before I met\n&gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were basical=\r\nly sadhakas themselves, I\n&gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind y=\r\nourself, how will you lead\n&gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen Go=\r\nd yourself face to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (=\r\nbecause a deity has a different time\n&gt; space frame which runs in thousands =\r\nof years which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; eye) by waiting with patience, th=\r\nen where will God go? God has to come, He\n&gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Love\n&gt; Ma=\r\nnish\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Feb 27, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charte=\r\nr.net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you see the old mail quoted by Hem=\r\nanth below, it will answer your\n&gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just because a group =\r\nof people think something is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt; does not free them =\r\nfrom karma.

As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s=\r\n dharma becomes clearer to one. The sense of dharma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; condit=\r\nioned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Secondly, even doing =\r\none&#39;s true dharma does not mean one does not incur\n&gt; &gt; karma.

Krishna clearly says in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagava=\r\nd Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; el=\r\nse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Following the path of dharma basically means enga=\r\nging in the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to per=\r\nson, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on wh=\r\nat nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have be=\r\nen in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying wi=\r\nth the action, who you affected in\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the ac=\r\ntions that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process=\r\n, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nf, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrson\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on on=\r\ne&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to =\r\nspread the message\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debt=\r\ns, nature wants a person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world, =\r\nthat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies a=\r\nnd karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; money and=\r\n construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weig=\r\nht.\n&gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization des=\r\ntroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone f=\r\nor it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilit=\r\nate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other=\r\n side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna =\r\nwas born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;=\r\ns sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, accord=\r\ning to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new time a=\r\nnd place. He was born to renounce material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aristocra=\r\ntic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generat=\r\nions to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oth=\r\ners. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is=\r\n one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words say=\r\ning &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the=\r\n light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been t=\r\nhere in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility w=\r\nas very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. =\r\nHe became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ksha=\r\ntrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; la=\r\nter. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; varn=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As =\r\none\n&gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells yo=\r\nu to know\n&gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there a=\r\nre not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual dh=\r\narma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult.=\r\n If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of=\r\n us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but=\r\n it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds whi=\r\nch tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We should ma=\r\nke the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\necide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; do=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; More than foll=\r\nowing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actions wi=\r\nthout identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accumulati=\r\nng new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identificat=\r\nion with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we shou=\r\nld leave the\n&gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what=\r\n will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama kar=\r\nma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego an=\r\nd purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind w=\r\nill work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive=\r\n feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly =\r\nand follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but=\r\n not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if o=\r\nne is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dhar=\r\nma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little attac=\r\nhment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intell=\r\nect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words=\r\n of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from =\r\nthem. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one =\r\nsurrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the m=\r\naster to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When A=\r\nrjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; gurus\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified =\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about =\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =\r\nplace to do\n&gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed =\r\nupon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother =\r\nfor him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know w=\r\nho one is, what\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one =\r\ncan err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is=\r\n an elevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, suc=\r\nh a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomlin=\r\ne is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decla=\r\nre that as the dharma.

In the\n&gt; &gt; beginning, he may sti=\r\nll distract you and make it more difficult to read.\n&gt; &gt; But, it is possible=\r\n that he also likes the book and starts enjoying the book\n&gt; &gt; along with yo=\r\nu and stops distracting you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If meditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is like the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n friend and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like the distraction=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; caused by the friend, then aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getti=\r\nng the\n&gt; &gt; friend to read the book along with you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, as I said, there are no guarantees.

The idea is\n&gt; &gt; that one is not =\r\nbound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symboli=\r\nc stories of wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explain how one =\r\ncan fight and overcome various\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses that typically bind one in Ma=\r\nayaa. Reciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; regular basis will promote the fighti=\r\nng spirit within one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong in understanding Maay=\r\naa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; fight/overcome it at the same time.

One\n&gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight and o=\r\nvercome it.

It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One =\r\nof the names\n&gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=82 Aghora (aghori) does=\r\n not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as imperman=\r\nent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind o=\r\nn what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations=\r\n of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone di=\r\nes, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; carrying the dead =\r\nbody to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; is true and e=\r\nverything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; that life=\r\n and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; But=\r\n the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and=\r\n want\n&gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This th=\r\ning that\n&gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful ar=\r\ne temporary\n&gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on=\r\n temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone =\r\nattacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we t=\r\nell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt; temporary illusio=\r\nns. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; temporary illusion=\r\ns&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s min=\r\nd thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; rejects all *impermane=\r\nnt manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; them by classifyin=\r\ng them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; about them wit=\r\nh attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; permanen=\r\nt. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedant=\r\na says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; An aghora=\r\n pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; illusi=\r\nons and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; question=\r\ns why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; fece=\r\ns is eaten.=C3=82 But, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point.=\r\n For\n&gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a p=\r\nerson&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;fec=\r\nes&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the =\r\nmind will not be\n&gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with ce=\r\nrtain properties and\n&gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thin=\r\nking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions rea=\r\nlly. He chants\n&gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I=\r\n am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may mere=\r\nly be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats,=\r\n his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty=\r\n laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) =\r\nand waver from the focus on the\n&gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling th=\r\nemselves the same\n&gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thou=\r\nght and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation =\r\nwhere failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. That can in fact w=\r\nork as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of=\r\n a person who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consum=\r\ning Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from =\r\nfailing to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the =\r\nmind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other=\r\n food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; the mind fails to ab=\r\nsorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; be so disgusting=\r\n. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; experience may=\r\n act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accompli=\r\nshed by\n&gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Ag=\r\nhora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; sadhana=\r\n, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce c=\r\nelibacy and keep the mind\n&gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a =\r\nformula for overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may stil=\r\nl come and distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there=\r\n is no guarantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to bi=\r\nte one after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; fascination some minds may =\r\nhave for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora =\r\nwill take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; cause and remov=\r\ne fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; sex as two =\r\ndifferent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; combine th=\r\nem into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; an agh=\r\nora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhis japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to=\r\n do\n&gt; &gt; japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. H=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically o=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the =\r\nhead\n&gt; &gt; may not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ndenser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but\n&gt; &gt; they ma=\r\ny now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time\n&gt; &gt; in =\r\nmeditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the pers=\r\non&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based=\r\n on prior experiences and the\n&gt; &gt; thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora someti=\r\nmes tries to break down some of\n&gt; &gt; these structures by engaging in certain=\r\n practices that undermine those\n&gt; &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. I=\r\nt is also\n&gt; &gt; possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice me=\r\nrely for sex\n&gt; &gt; and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instea=\r\nd of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one wa=\r\ns not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82 Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stake=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and wh=\r\nat is\n&gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absor=\r\nb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war pla=\r\nn. However, it\n&gt; &gt; is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aver=\r\nsion. More\n&gt; &gt; dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on=\r\n a wrong\n&gt; &gt; understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=\r\n=82 Aghora stands\n&gt; &gt; for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* a=\r\nttract some people\n&gt; &gt; pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets=\r\n of Aghora and\n&gt; &gt; Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to acc=\r\nelerates how one\n&gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failur=\r\ne very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, =\r\nthe following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual\n&gt; &gt; paths and=\r\n explains the basic reality.

My performing a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY a=\r\nre doing\n&gt; &gt; Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now.
