To me, Ramakrishna&#39;s words and the Mother&#39;s words are not that different=\r\n. When he lived, Ramakrishna essentially carried out the Mother&#39;s will.\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \nRamakrishna&#39;s disciples were spiritual giants with imp=\r\neccable backgrounds and pedigree. Still each of them needed really serious =\r\nsadhana to find Self again. That is the nature of rebirth and Kali yuga. Th=\r\ney all were lucky to have Ramakrishna&#39;s company. Ramakrishna taught the hig=\r\nhest spiritual truths in simple words to them, made their thinking clear an=\r\nd inspired them so much. They had clarity from Ramakrishna&#39;s influence and =\r\nmeditated for 4-5 hours everyday and sometimes more. STILL, they needed one=\r\n or two decades of such serious sadhana to become liberated again.\n \nWhen o=\r\nne is able to meditate for 5 hours everyday, that may be sufficient and the=\r\nre may not be a need for homam. But lifestyles have changed in the last 100=\r\n years. If one is unable to meditate for 4-5 hours everyday, fire ritual is=\r\n a great option. In other words, there may not have been a compelling need =\r\nfor a homam movement 100 years back, but it may be there now.\n \nWhen Ramakr=\r\nishna lived, intelligent young Indians were being indoctrinated with wester=\r\nn thinking and started to look at Hinduism as primitive. Some of them were =\r\nalso attracted by the impersonal philosophy of Brahmo samaj and detested id=\r\nol worship. Ramakrishna did two things: (1) To those attracted by the imper=\r\nsonal philosophy, he showed the magic of surrendering to a deity such as Ka=\r\nli or Krishna and demonstrated true bhakti, (2) He had his sishyas such as =\r\nVivekananda propagate the non-dualistic Advaita philosophy in the west and =\r\nin India. This two-pronged approach countered the intellectual onslaught on=\r\n Hinduism and kept many intelligent young minds from running away from Hind=\r\nuism.\n \nTimes are different now and needs are different.
