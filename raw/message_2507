There remains a big controversy in this\ndecision. Sometimes it happen=\r\ns that Tithi is changed after few hours\nfrom sunrise as per Sun Moon distan=\r\nce. I will give one example. My\nmother expired in 1999 on Ashtami tithi as =\r\nper calendar. This tithi was\nupto 5-35 evening as per real calculation of S=\r\nun Moon distance. My\nmother expired at 23.25 hours at night on Ashtami tith=\r\ni when actually\nNavami tithi was started from 5.35 hours. Which day I shoul=\r\nd fix for\nShraddha and death anniversary ? Ashtami or Navami ? ( I am doing=\r\n\nShraddham on Navami ).\n\n2.Some say that Tithi of actual death moment shoul=\r\nd be taken for\nShraddha day and one openion is that Day of funeral ceremony=\r\n should be\ntaken as Shraddha day. If one expires on Saptami late evening an=\r\nd if\nfuneral is done on Ashtami morning, Ashtami should be taken as Shraddh=\r\na\nTithi. But I am not convinced with this second openion as sometimes\nfuner=\r\nal is done after so many days, how this funeral day is acceptable?\n\nKindly =\r\ngive some light on these confusions.
