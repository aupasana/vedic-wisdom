All the sages, saints, prophets, world- =\r\nteachers, incarnations, great men, have had their own Gurus, however great =\r\nthey might have been. Svetaketu learnt the nature of Truth from Uddalaka, M=\r\naitreyi from Yajnavalkya, Bhrigu from Varuna, Narada from Sanatkumara, Nach=\r\niketas from Yama, Indra from Prajapati; and several others humbly went to w=\r\nise ones, observed strict Brahmacharya, practised rigorous discipline, and =\r\nlearnt Brahma-vidya (the science of God) from them.\n\nLord Krishna sat at th=\r\ne feet of His Guru Sandeepani. Lord Rama had Guru Vasishtha who gave Him Up=\r\nadesha (spiritual advice). Lord Jesus sought John to be baptised by him on =\r\nthe banks of the river Jordan. Even Devas (celestial beings) have Brihaspat=\r\ni as their Guru. Even the greatest among the divine beings sat at the feet =\r\nof Guru Dakshinamurti.\n\nA neophyte must have a personal Guru first. He cann=\r\not have God as Guru to begin with. He must have a pure mind. He must have e=\r\nthical perfection. He, must be intensely virtuous. He must be above body-co=\r\nnsciousness. Then alone can he have God as Guru.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
