Th=\r\ne hundred years are taken up by karma. Then, when will one find time for ac=\r\nquiring knowledge before his death? The arguments of the karma-kandins are =\r\nnot sound. For there cannot be any motive or desire to act when there is th=\r\ne knowledge of the highest truth. He does not find any use in the performan=\r\nce of karma. When one gets a desire to know the atman which is free from al=\r\nl the faults of samsara, one does not find any benefit out of actions which=\r\n he has done or which he has to do. If you say that he does it because it i=\r\ns so enjoined although he sees no good in it, we say it cannot be, for he h=\r\nas known the atman which is beyond all injunctions. One who knows Brahman c=\r\nannot be bound by injunctions and rules. Even the Veda is born of him, so h=\r\ne cannot be commanded by the Veda to do any karma. None can be directed by =\r\nhis own words proceeding from his own knowledge. A wise master cannot be di=\r\nrected by an ignorant servant. \n\n\n"}}
