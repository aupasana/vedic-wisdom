Of course you do!  Who doesn&#39;t have=\r\n friends?  \nTo even pose such a question would seem silly to many of us.  A=\r\ns \nhuman beings, most of us are social by nature, and we need to express \no=\r\nur need for relationship in the form of our many friends and loved \nones.  =\r\nMost of us even have one or two people who we would call our \nvery best fri=\r\nends =96 people whom we trust completely, and who we know \nare always there=\r\n for us in times of trouble.  \n\nWhile almost all of us can say that we have=\r\n truly good friends, \nhowever, the truth of the matter is that most of us h=\r\nave no real \nknowledge about who our truly best of friend really is.  The v=\r\nery \nbest friend that we have is the same one whom we tend to ignore the \ne=\r\nasiest.  Indeed, most of us spend much of our lives running away \nfrom our =\r\nvery best friend as fast as our little feet can take us.  \nThat very best f=\r\nriend in your life is Bhagavan: God.  It is God who \nis not only your very =\r\nbest of friends, but who is responsible for the \nfriends that you do have n=\r\now.  \n\nAccepting the reality that God has given us the gift of friendship i=\r\nn \nour lives, I want to pose an interesting question to you.\n\nThink of the =\r\nvery closest friend that you have in this world.  This \nperson cares about =\r\nyou and would do anything for you, right?  Of \ncourse he would.  Well, this=\r\n is my question:  Do you have any friend \nor loved one in the world, includ=\r\ning even your very best friend, who \nyou can say will never abandon you?  D=\r\no you have a friend who, in \nfact, will look after you and follow you as yo=\r\nu traverse lifetime \nafter lifetime, sometimes being in male bodies and som=\r\netimes in \nfemale bodies, sometimes in the body of a slug or sometimes in t=\r\nhe \nbody of a king; who will be there as a silent witness seeing you in \nyo=\r\nur best of times, but also seeing you when you&#39;re at your very \nworst?  If =\r\nyou answer this question honestly, you know that there is \nabsolutely no on=\r\ne =96 however much they may truly love you =96 who would \nbe willing to do =\r\nthis for you.  No one.  \n\nYet you do have such a friend.  God as Antaryamin=\r\n (the Inner Witness) \npatiently and lovingly accompanies us as we journey f=\r\nrom one life to \nanother.  Bhagavan (God) doesn&#39;t ever judge us or abandon =\r\nus.  Rather \nGod chooses to reside ever-present within our hearts as the si=\r\nlent \nwitness of our actions, emotions, and thoughts, observing us in our \n=\r\ngood times, and at our very cruelest and most selfish times.  Yet, \neven mo=\r\nre so than the most loving parent we could ever imagine, God \nnever gives u=\r\np on us.  Instead, He waits patiently and lovingly, our \nTrue Friend, yearn=\r\ning for us to come to the realization that we are \nnever alone.  He waits f=\r\nor us to quiet our mind, to still our \nuncontrolled desire for selfish purs=\r\nuits, and to turn to Him and His \nloving embrace.  \n\nTo know this Eternal F=\r\nriend, we must cultivate love and devotion \n(bhakti), for this is all that =\r\nGod asks of us:  that we make Him the \npriority in our lives, and that we t=\r\nry to love our very Best Friend \nas He loves us.  This friend has written u=\r\ns a letter of love called \nthe Bhagavad Gita.  Read Bhagavan&#39;s letter to yo=\r\nu, love Him, and live \nHis Dharma daily.  Thus you will know more joy, more=\r\n peace, more \nfulfillment, and more bliss than any human friend can ever gi=\r\nve you.  \nYou will directly experience the love of Bhagavan.  \n\n\nThe Author=\r\n:\nDr. Frank Morales (Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya) has been a \npracticing =\r\nAmerican Hindu for over 30 years.
