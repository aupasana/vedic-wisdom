The turiya asrama name of this upasaka is\nShri Bhaskarananda Saraswati who happens to be the devi upasaka in\nthe lineage of Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati (Tembe Maharaj).  There\nis no whereabouts of this great upasaka but I got some of the\nwonderful manuscripts related to Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya and Yoga\nGayatri Upasana, its process of meditation and the process of Shat\nChakra Bhedana.\n\n  Though the presentation of entire contents of the manuscripts is\nnot possible for me as the manuscripts runs into 150 pages, here is\nan attempt of mine to highlight some of the important points which\nmay be useful to the upasakas.  However, this should be learnt from\nsadguru hailing from sat-sampradaya.\n\n  The 3 charitas of sapthasati are the symbolic representation of 3\nknots or grandhis namely brahma grandhi, Vishnu grandhi and rudra\ngrandhi.  The chit-AbhAsa (false identification of the sthula,\nsukshma and karana dehas to be �?oone�?Ts own self�?�).  This\n�?~chidAbhAsa�?� is of 3 types: karmaja, sahaja and bhramaja.\n\n  Brahma grandhi is the identification of oneself with sthula deha\n(sthula deha abhimana).   The sthula and sukshma deha tAdAtmyata\n(false identification of oneself with gross and subtle body). This is\nKarmaja Chidabhasa. The annihilation of pUrvajanma vAsanAs in the\nform of �?oMala�?� or �?odirt�?� is Brahma Grandhi Bhedana.\n\n  Vishnu Grandhi is the identification of oneself with sukshma deha\n(sukshma deha abhimana).    AntahkaraNa-chidAbhAsa-tadAtmyata is the\nSahaja ChidAbhAsa.  Annihilation of manO-vikshEpa is the Vishnu\nGrandhi Bhedana.\n\n  Rudra Grandhi is the identification of oneself with Karana deha\n(chidAbhAsa adhishTAna chaitanya tAdAtmyata).  This is Bhramaja\nChidabhasa.  The dawn of sva-svarupa jnana when the avarana dosha\n(veil of ignorance in the form of Avidya) is removed is the Rudra\nGrandhi Bhedana.\n\n  So, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra Grandhis are the 3 episodes or charitas of\nChandi Sapthasati.  The sumedha rishi of Sapthasathi is the Rishi\nHaritayana who was initiated into Srividya by Shri Parashurama.\nParashurama inturn was initiated by Sage Dattatreya.\n\n  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswathi explaining the inner significance of\nSapthsati says that �?osavarni�?� is the surya sakti,\n�?osvArochisha�?� is the svarga-sambandha-jyoti,\n�?ochaitravamshasamudbhavah�?� is the being born and re-born as\ndifferent species (chitra vichitra janma), �?okshitimandala�?� is the\ngross physical body or sarira, �?osuratha�?� is the jiva who is\ninterested in 3rd purusharta ie., kama and �?oSamadhi�?� is the jiva\nwho is interested in 4th purushartha ie., moksha.\n\n\n  Vishnu-karna-mala is the �?omala�?� or �?odirt�?� or �?ocovering�?�\naround the chidAkasa (Vishnu-karna).  During the dissolution, Vishnu\nis one with Yogamaya and hence Chit swarupa.  Karna is the sruti\n(ear) whose tanmatra is sound.  So, Madhu and Kaitabha are the Mala /\nDirt that covers the Nirmala Chidakasa.  Madhu is the Ananda Lakshana\nand Kaitabha is the �?omyriad of insects�?� in the form of Sanchita\nKarma.  The Brahma which is symbolic representation of Manas (Mind)\npraises the Mahamaya to annihilate the Madhu-Kaitabha in the form of\nSanchita Karma.  Waking up of Vishnu is the MahAprANa in Action.\n\n  So, annihilitation of   Madhu-Kaitabha is the removal of Karmajata-\ntadAtmyata in the form of brahmagrandhi bhedana (Vasana Kshaya).\n\n  The Madhyama Charita indicates the Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana which is\nof the form of Sahaja Chidabhasa.  Mahishasura represents Rajo Guna\nin the form of Krodha (anger).\n\n  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati also describes a �?oSecret Upanishad\nVidya�?� which is embedded in Madhyama Charita.  This is called\n�?oJyotishmati Vidya�?�.  The Nada which the Devi makes is the\nAnahata Dhwani and the Simha (lion) vahana is the Himsa dharma which\nthe sadhaka has to adopt during the upasana. The Jiva with Himsa\nBhava should annihilate his Jiva-bhava.  The vyashti prana of the\nJiva dissolves in Samasti Prana.  When this is achieved, the Sukshma-\ndeha abhimana drops off.  This is Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana.  This is\nthe victory over sahaja-chidAbhAsa.\n\n  Though among the 5 kosas, the Jiva has penetrated till Vijnana-maya\nKosa, he still faces the lack of BrahmAnubhUti which is only through\nAparOksha Jnana.  With the dawn of Aparoksha Jnana, the last knot is\nremoved which is Rudra Grandhi.  With the removal of veil of\nignorance, the avarana drops in the form of Bhramaja ChidAbhAsa.\n\n  Chanda denotes mUlAvidya; munda denotes tUlAvidya; dhUmralOchana\ndenotes bhrAnti, raktabIja denotes bhOga lAlasa (bhOga vAncha);\nshumbha denotes ahamkara; nishumbha denotes mamakara. The 8 armies of\nshumbha-nishumbha denotes:\n  ghriNa, lajja, bhaya, shanka, jugupsa, kula, shIla, jAti.  These 8\ntendencies are 8 pAsAs (ashta-pAsa).  To remove these 8 pasas, the 8\nvidya murtis come forth in the form of Brahmi, �?�..etc.\n\n  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati explains wonderfully the Chandi\nNavakshari Mantra taking the pramana from Damara Tantra and Shri\nBhaskara.  Chamunda is the destroyer of Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya.\n\n  There are 3 devatas in Urdhwa Amnaya.  They are Viccheswari,\nHamseshwari, Samvartheshwari.  Vicche is the address to this Urdhwa\nAmnaya Devata �?oViccheshwari�?� which is the �?overy auspicious\ndeity�?� and �?oever intent in giving liberation out of\ncompassion�?�.  This is the �?ochitkala rupa parama Ardra dEvta�?�\nwhich bestows the �?opralaya jnana�?� to the upasaka.  Moreover,\n�?ovicche�?� is vit+cha+I which implies �?ochit�?�, �?osat�?� and\nAnanda rupa of the Chamunda which is tri-shati rupini as Mahakali\n(aim), Mahalakshi (hrim) and Mahasaraswati (klim).  To such Chamunda\nwho destroys the Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya, I bow.\n\n\n  This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya given by Paramahamsa\nParivrajakacharya Bhaskarananda Saraswathi who hails from Datta\nSampradaya.\n\n  With regards,\n  sriram\n\n\n"}}
