Krishnaswamy Iyer\n\nA touring Educational Officer once met His Holiness and said,\n\n&quot;I have occasions of being in constant touch with young boys, mostly\nBrahmanas, studying in schools which I have to inspect. I have found that\neven the boys who perform their sandhya do so more as a form than as real\nworship. I shall be very grateful if Your Holiness would give me some\nvaluable hints which I could convey to them&quot;\n\n*Acharya: *I am very glad to see that you are not content with mere official\nroutine of inspection but desire to utilise the occasion for the betterment\nof the boys. It will be well if all educationists, inspecting officers or\nteachers, realise that they have been entrusted with the very grave\nresponsibility of training up young men in the most impressionable period of\ntheir lives. In my opinion they are really to blame if they confine their\nattention only to the prescribed text books and neglect the spiritual side\nof the young generation.\n\nI always keep that end before me and I don&#39;t miss any opportunity of talking\nto the boys and giving them some useful advice. It is mainly with a view to\ndo that work better that i request Your Holiness to give some practical\nsuggestions.\n\n*Acharya: *Even if the boys to whom you propose to convey such suggestions\nmay not benefit by them, you will certainly be benefited.\n\nCertainly.\n\n*Acharya: *You may therefore, for the present, ignore the boys and ask such\nquestions the answers to which are likely to be useful to you.\n\nThe first question which suggests itself to me is with reference to the\nsandhya worship. What is the deity or upasya devata in the sandhya Worship?\n\n*Acharya: *Before we consider that, please tell me what you understand\nordinarily by the sandhya worship?\n\nBy sandhya worship we mean the worship of the rising Sun, the setting Sun or\nSun in the mid heavens.\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so. Comprehensively speaking, you mean worship of the Sun?\n\nYes.\n\n*Acharya: *You tell me that sandhya is the worship of the Sun and yet you\nask me what is worshipped in the sandhya. Don&#39;t you think it is an\nunnecessary question?\n\nPut so, it may seem an unnecessary question, but my real question is, what\nis the Sun that is worshipped?\n\n*Acharya: *What do you understand ordinarily by the Sun?\n\nWe mean the bright celestial orb in the sky.\n\n*Acharya: *Then it is that bright celestial orb that is worshipped.\n\nBut that orb is, according to science, mere inert matter in a state of high\ncombustion and is certainly not worthy of being worshipped by intelligent\nbeings like ourselves. It can neither hear our prayers nor respond to them.\nI cannot believe that our ancestors were so ignorant as to address their\nprayers to a mere burning mass of matter\n\n*Acharya: *I quite agree with you. They could never have been so foolish.\n\nWhat then did they see in the Sun to justify their prayers being addressed\nto it?\n\n*Acharya: *You said just now that addressing of prayers to inert matter\ncannot be justified by reason.\n\nYes.\n\n*Acharya: *What then must be the nature of the entity to which a prayer is\naddressed?\n\nThe primary condition is that it must not be mere inert matter, but must be\nendowed with intelligence.\n\n*Acharya: *And the second condition?\n\nThat it must be able to hear our prayers and be powerful enough to answer\nthem.\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so. If our ancients were not fools and yet addressed their\nprayers to the Sun, their conception of the Sun must have been quite\ndifferent from that of mere inert matter, in a state of high combustion.\n\nYes, they must have also postulated of it intelligence, the capacity to hear\nus and the ability to help us.\n\n*Acharya: *The &#39;us&#39; including not only all those who are now living to raise\ntheir hands in prayer to the Sun, but also the generations, past and future,\ninfinite in number though they may be?\n\nOf course.\n\n*Acharya: *The entity that is worshipped as the Sun is therefore one whose\nintelligence or ability knows no limitation of space or time.\n\nIt must be so.\n\n*Acharya: *You have now got your answer to the question as to who is\nworshipped in the sandhya? It is an intelligent Being, omniscient and\nomnipotent in the matter of hearing and responding to its votaries.\n\nYour Holiness then means that it is a deva who has his habitation in the\nsolar orb?\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so. He has not only his habitation there, but the solar orb\nitself is his physical body.\n\nYour Holiness means that the deva enlivens the solar orb, just as we do our\nphysical bodies?\n\n*Acharya: *Just so.\n\nIf then he is embodied just like us, how does he happen to have such high\nintelligence or power as to merit our obeisance?\n\n*Acharya: *He attained that status by virtue of the appropriate karma and\nupasana done by him in a previous life.\n\nDoes Your Holiness mean that he was at one time just like ourselves and that\nhe attained that status by his endeavour?\n\n*Acharya: *Yes.\n\nThen he is no more than a jiva, which I aIso am. Why should a Jiva make\nprostration before another Jiva, howsoever superior?\n\n*Acharya: *Why should your son or pupil respect you and why should you show\nrespect to your superior officers? Are not both of you jivas?\n\nNo doubt we are. But we respect our superiors as it is in their power to\nhelp us or injure us, if they so desire.\n\n*Acharya: *That is a very low kind of respect. Anyhow, taking even that kind\nof respect, we must respect Surya devata if it is in his power to help us or\ninjure us, if he so desires.\n\nOf course.\n\n*Acharya: *Being a jiva as much as your superior officers, he will help you\nif you appeal to him for help or injure you if you ignore or despise him. In\nyour own interest then, you are bound to worship him and secure his\ngoodwill.\n\nBut 1 need not court the favour nor fear the displeasure of my superior\nofficer, if I carry out the duties of my office faithfully.\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so.\n\nIf I preserve that attitude, there is no reason why I should propitiate my\nsuperior officer\n\n*Acharya: *Certainly not.\n\nSimilarly, if l carry out strictly the duties enjoined on me by the sastras,\nI need not propitiate any other jiva, be he the highest devil.\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so.\n\nThen, should I not give up the worship of Surya devata?\n\n*Acharya: *Certainly you may, unless of course such a worship is part of the\nduties enjoined on you by the Sastras.\n\nHow can that be?\n\n*Acharya: *It is true that an honest and strict officer in performing the\nduties of his office need not mind the pleasure or the displeasure of his\nimmediate superior. But the mere fact that he thinks it necessary or\nobligatory to perform those duties properly, shows that he has as the\nultimate end the pleasure, or avoidance of the displeasure of a still higher\nofficer who is superior to him as well as to his immediate superior. Even if\nhe has no personal acquaintance with that higher officer, he always has in\nthe background of his mind an undefined power, call it the King or the\nGovernment, when he performs the duties of his office. And that power has\nthe ability to benefit him by a recognition of his services or to punish him\nby taking note of his delinquencies. Further, that power rules both him and\nhis immediate superior officer. If therefore that power requires him to\nbehave in a particular manner towards his superior officer, he cannot afford\nto disobey that injunction, for if he disobeys, not only does he incur the\ndispleasure of that officer but also of the higher power.\n\nThat is so.\n\n*Acharya: *Similarly, if a power which rules both you as well as Surya\ndevata requires you to conduct yourself in a particular manner towards that\ndeva, you cannot afford to neglect that injunction, but must conform to it\nor take the risk of incurring the displeasure of that deva as also of the\nhigher power.\n\nIt is no doubt so. But in that case, in prostrating myself before Surya\ndevata, I shall be really worshipping the higher power even when my worship\nmay seem addressed to the Surya.\n\n*Acharya: *What of that?\n\nIf I am able to conceive of such a higher power who rules even the Surya,\nthat power is really the worshipped entity although to all appearances the\nworship is addressed to the Surya only.\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so.\n\nBut Your Holiness said that it, was Surya devata who was worshipped?\n\n*Acharya: *Yes. It is correct so far as persons who are not able to conceive\nof a higher power are concerned. To those however who can conceive of that\npower, He is the real upasya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He\nenlivens and ensouls not only the Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and\ninhabits not only the solar orb but all things. He is the cosmic personality\nwho is the soul of all things.\n\nI suppose just as we have the sense of I &#39;in our physical bodies, so does\nthat cosmic personality has the sense of &quot;I&quot; in the entire cosmos.\n\n*Acharya: *He has.\n\nIf so, the difference between Him and me lies not in the presence or the\nabsence of the sense of &#39;I&#39; but only in the degree, the range or the\nmagnitude of that sense. Mine is restricted, His is extended.\n\n*Acharya: *It is so.\n\nif it is the sense of &quot;I&quot; that is responsible for the concept of a Jiva, he\nmust be as much a jiva as myself\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so. In fact He is called the First Born.\n\nThen, even if this higher power happens to belong to the category of Jivas,\njust like myself, the same objection which I mentioned against the worship\nof Surya devata holds good in his case also.\n\n*Acharya: *What then would you like to worship?\n\nA transcendent power which is not a jiva.\n\n*Acharya: *Have it then that it is such a transcendent power that is\nworshipped in the sandhya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lord, or the\nantaryami, the inner ruler.\n\nBut I have heard it mentioned that the terms Lord&#39; and Ruler&#39; are only\nrelative terms which are used in regard to Him when we want to describe Him\nin relation to the universe, which is &#39;lorded over &#39;or &#39;ruled&#39; by Him.\n\n*Acharya: *Yes, it is so.\n\nIt cannot be that we can have no conception of him apart from his\nrelationship of some sort to the universe. His relationship to the universe\ncan at best be only an extraneous circumstance. In His essence, He must have\nan independent existence quite unrelated to anything else.\n\n*Acharya: *You are right. We call that unrelated essential existence\nBrahman.\n\nIf it is so, that must be the real object of worship rather than the\nrelative aspect called lshwara.\n\n*Acharya: *It is even as you say. It is really the unqualified Brahman that\nis worshipped in the sandhya.\n\nI cannot really understand Your Holiness. You first said that it was the\nsolar orb that was the objector worship, but when I pointed out that it was\nonly inert matter, you said that it was Surya devata that was the object of\nworship; when again I pointed out that he was only a limited jiva like\nmyself, you said it was Hiranyagarbha, the cosmic soul, that was the object\nof worship: when once again I pointed out that he was after all a jiva,\nhowever cosmic his sense of &#39;I&#39; may be, you said that lswara the Lord and\nRuler of the universe was really the object of worship; and lastly when I\nsaid that even he is but a relative aspect of Brahman, you said that the\nobject of worship was Brahman itself\n\n*Acharya: *I did say so.\n\nBut I fail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.\n\n*Acharya: *Where is the difficulty?\n\nThe object in a particular worship can be only one. How can it be the solar\norb or the deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Iswara or Brahman at the\nsame time?\n\n*Acharya: *I never said that it was the solar orb or the devil and so on.\n\nDoes Your Holiness mean to say then that the object of worship is the solar\norb and the devil and Hiranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?\n\n*Acharya: *Nor did I say anything of that sort.\n\nHow then am I to understand Your Holiness&#39; statements?\n\n*Acharya: *When did I tell you that the upasya was Surya?\n\nWhen I mentioned that the physical mass of burning matter cannot be the\nobject of worship.\n\n*Acharya: *Before you mentioned it, I said that it was even that mass that\nwas the upasya.\n\nYes.\n\n*Acharya: *I never mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an\nalternative. To one who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is\nthe physical mass; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as\nan object of worship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever\none, but its exact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping\naspirant. The upasya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil\ndoes not satisfy the enquiring devotee. We say then that it is\nHiranyagarbha. When even such a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we\ntell the devotee that he is really worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When\nhe begins to feel that even the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential\nnature, we tell him that it is the infinite Brahman itself that is really\nworshipped. Where is the difficulty?\n\nDoes Your Holiness then mean that it is not possible to definitely say what\nthe object of worship in the sandhya is except with reference to the mental\nequipment or intellectual advancement of the worshipper?\n\n*Acharya: *How can there be an object of worship if we ignore the\nworshipper? The nature of the worshipped necessarily depends upon the nature\nof the worshipper.\n\nHow?\n\n*Acharya: *Take me for example. All of you show me respect. But the object\nof respect, though it is, roughly speaking, myself, does differ with each\none of you. Ordinary people respect me and like to see me surrounded by\nglittering paraphernalia; their attention and respect are claimed by those\narticles rather than by my personality. Such people will show the same\nrespect to others who have similar paraphernalia. Their homage is not\ntherefore really paid to me but only to the paraphernalia. Some others\nrespect me for the position that I hold or for the Asrama in which I am.\nSuch people will equally respect others who are or may come to be in such a\nposition or in such an Asrama, their homage is therefore not paid to me but\nto my position or to the Asrama. And some others may not care what position\nI hold or in what Asrama I am, but give me homage wherever I go and however\nI may be; their object of respect is my physical body. A few others will not\nmind if my body is dark or ugly or even diseased, but will nevertheless give\nme homage if by purity of mind and character or by the power of my intellect\nand learning or by any spiritual merit that I may possess I command their\nrespect. Very few indeed will respect me for the spark of divine\nintelligence which inheres in me, as it does in all of you.\n\nOf course it is not possible to say that all the devotees that approach Your\nHoliness are of the same mental equipment.\n\n*Acharya: *Quite so. But, ordinarily all these people, whether they really\ntender homage to the paraphernalia or to my status and Asrama or to my body\nor to my mind or to my intellect or to the divine spark in me, prostrate\nbefore me to show their respect. Can you tell me, apart from any reference\nto the several devotees, to whom or to what they prostrate?\n\nIt is no doubt very difficult to answer\n\n*Acharya: *Similarly, with every kind of worship. Externally viewed, there\nwill be no appreciable difference between the one who respects me for the\nparaphernalia and another who respects me for the divine spark in me.\nExternally viewed, there will similarly be no appreciable difference between\nthe devotee who in his blind faith is content to address his prayers to the\nluminous Sun and another who turns to it as a visible symbol of the infinite\nBrahman. The question as to what is the upasya in the sandhya worship can\ntherefore be answered only in this way.\n\nI now understand how in the simple worship of the Sun all possible stages in\nspiritual perception have been provided for\n\n*Acharya: *It is not only this, for you will find if you consider the matter\nstill further, that all the three ways known as karma, bhakti and Gyana have\nbeen given places in the daily worship, but that is a different matter.\nSimple as the sandhya worship seems to be, it is sufficient to help us on to\nthe highest stages. It is as useful to the highest aspirant as it is to the\nbeginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value or to neglect it\nin practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Jul 16, 2011 at 11:00 PM, Ananda Kishora Dadi &lt;varaha_2000@...\n&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt;      Who is the deity for Gayatri mantra, if we use it in Homa?\n&gt;\n&gt;     How to use this great mantra in Homam, if it is correct to use it in\n&gt; homam?\n&gt;\n&gt;     Who is deity for all mighty SUN?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank youu,\n&gt; Ananda\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--bcaec5215f7318877d04a83dbc24\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New =\r\nRoman&#39;; font-size: medium; &quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple=\r\n-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; font-size: me=\r\ndium; &quot;&gt;The Sandhya Worship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-s=\r\npan&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; font-size: medium; &quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;author&quot;&gt;By Sri Chandrashekara Bharati Swamigal=A0&lt;br&gt;C=\r\nompiled by Sri R.

They could never have been s=\r\no foolish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What then did they see in the Sun to justify=\r\n their prayers being addressed to it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i=\r\n&gt;You said just now that addressing of prayers to inert matter cannot be jus=\r\ntified by reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya=\r\n:=A0&lt;/i&gt;What then must be the nature of the entity to which a prayer is add=\r\nressed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary condition is that it must not be me=\r\nre inert matter, but must be endowed with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;And the second condition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That it =\r\nmust be able to hear our prayers and be powerful enough to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. If our ancients were not fools=\r\n and yet addressed their prayers to the Sun, their conception of the Sun mu=\r\nst have been quite different from that of mere inert matter, in a state of =\r\nhigh combustion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, they must have also postulated =\r\nof it intelligence, the capacity to hear us and the ability to help us.&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;The &#39;us&#39; including not only all =\r\nthose who are now living to raise their hands in prayer to the Sun, but als=\r\no the generations, past and future, infinite in number though they may be?&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;The =\r\nentity that is worshipped as the Sun is therefore one whose intelligence or=\r\n ability knows no limitation of space or time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must =\r\nbe so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;You have now got your answer=\r\n to the question as to who is worshipped in the sandhya? It is an intellige=\r\nnt Being, omniscient and omnipotent in the matter of hearing and responding=\r\n to its votaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Holiness then means that it is=\r\n a deva who has his habitation in the solar orb?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ach=\r\narya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. He has not only his habitation there, but the solar o=\r\nrb itself is his physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Holiness means t=\r\nhat the deva enlivens the solar orb, just as we do our physical bodies?&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Just so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If then he =\r\nis embodied just like us, how does he happen to have such high intelligence=\r\n or power as to merit our obeisance?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;He attained that status by virtue of the appropriate karma and upasana do=\r\nne by him in a previous life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Your Holiness mean t=\r\nhat he was at one time just like ourselves and that he attained that status=\r\n by his endeavour?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he is no more than a jiva, which I aIso am. Why should a Jiva=\r\n make prostration before another Jiva, howsoever superior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Why should your son or pupil respect you and why shou=\r\nld you show respect to your superior officers? Are not both of you jivas?&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No doubt we are. But we respect our superiors as it is=\r\n in their power to help us or injure us, if they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;That is a very low kind of respect. Anyhow, taking e=\r\nven that kind of respect, we must respect Surya devata if it is in his powe=\r\nr to help us or injure us, if he so desires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of cours=\r\ne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Being a jiva as much as your super=\r\nior officers, he will help you if you appeal to him for help or injure you =\r\nif you ignore or despise him. In your own interest then, you are bound to w=\r\norship him and secure his goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 1 need not co=\r\nurt the favour nor fear the displeasure of my superior officer, if I carry =\r\nout the duties of my office faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;=\r\n/i&gt;Quite so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I preserve that attitude, there is no r=\r\neason why I should propitiate my superior officer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;=\r\nAcharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if l carry out=\r\n strictly the duties enjoined on me by the sastras, I need not propitiate a=\r\nny other jiva, be he the highest devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=\r\n=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, should I not give up the worship=\r\n of Surya devata?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Certainly you may, =\r\nunless of course such a worship is part of the duties enjoined on you by th=\r\ne Sastras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ac=\r\nharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is true that an honest and strict officer in performing the=\r\n duties of his office need not mind the pleasure or the displeasure of his =\r\nimmediate superior. But the mere fact that he thinks it necessary or obliga=\r\ntory to perform those duties properly, shows that he has as the ultimate en=\r\nd the pleasure, or avoidance of the displeasure of a still higher officer w=\r\nho is superior to him as well as to his immediate superior. Even if he has =\r\nno personal acquaintance with that higher officer, he always has in the bac=\r\nkground of his mind an undefined power, call it the King or the Government,=\r\n when he performs the duties of his office. And that power has the ability =\r\nto benefit him by a recognition of his services or to punish him by taking =\r\nnote of his delinquencies. Further, that power rules both him and his immed=\r\niate superior officer. If therefore that power requires him to behave in a =\r\nparticular manner towards his superior officer, he cannot afford to disobey=\r\n that injunction, for if he disobeys, not only does he incur the displeasur=\r\ne of that officer but also of the higher power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That =\r\nis so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Similarly, if a power which ru=\r\nles both you as well as Surya devata requires you to conduct yourself in a =\r\nparticular manner towards that deva, you cannot afford to neglect that inju=\r\nnction, but must conform to it or take the risk of incurring the displeasur=\r\ne of that deva as also of the higher power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no =\r\ndoubt so. But in that case, in prostrating myself before Surya devata, I sh=\r\nall be really worshipping the higher power even when my worship may seem ad=\r\ndressed to the Surya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;What of that?&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I am able to conceive of such a higher power who ru=\r\nles even the Surya, that power is really the worshipped entity although to =\r\nall appearances the worship is addressed to the Surya only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Your Holiness sa=\r\nid that it, was Surya devata who was worshipped?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ach=\r\narya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Yes. It is correct so far as persons who are not able to concei=\r\nve of a higher power are concerned. To those however who can conceive of th=\r\nat power, He is the real upasya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He enl=\r\nivens and ensouls not only the Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and inhab=\r\nits not only the solar orb but all things. He is the cosmic personality who=\r\n is the soul of all things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose just as we have=\r\n the sense of I &#39;in our physical bodies, so does that cosmic personalit=\r\ny has the sense of &quot;I&quot; in the entire cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0=\r\n&lt;/i&gt;He has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\nIf so, the difference between Him and me =\r\nlies not in the presence or the absence of the sense of &#39;I&#39; but onl=\r\ny in the degree, the range or the magnitude of that sense. Mine is restrict=\r\ned, His is extended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if it is the sense of &quot;I&quot; that is responsible for=\r\n the concept of a Jiva, he must be as much a jiva as myself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. In fact He is called the First Born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, even if this higher power happens to belong to the c=\r\nategory of Jivas, just like myself, the same objection which I mentioned ag=\r\nainst the worship of Surya devata holds good in his case also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;What then would you like to worship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A transcendent power which is not a jiva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;=\r\nAcharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Have it then that it is such a transcendent power that is wo=\r\nrshipped in the sandhya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lord, or the a=\r\nntaryami, the inner ruler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I have heard it mentio=\r\nned that the terms Lord&#39; and Ruler&#39; are only relative terms which a=\r\nre used in regard to Him when we want to describe Him in relation to the un=\r\niverse, which is &#39;lorded over &#39;or &#39;ruled&#39; by Him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Yes, it is so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It cannot=\r\n be that we can have no conception of him apart from his relationship of so=\r\nme sort to the universe. His relationship to the universe can at best be on=\r\nly an extraneous circumstance. In His essence, He must have an independent =\r\nexistence quite unrelated to anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Achary=\r\na:=A0&lt;/i&gt;You are right. We call that unrelated essential existence Brahman.=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is so, that must be the real object of worship r=\r\nather than the relative aspect called lshwara.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ach=\r\narya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is even as you say. It is really the unqualified Brahman tha=\r\nt is worshipped in the sandhya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot really underst=\r\nand Your Holiness. You first said that it was the solar orb that was the ob=\r\njector worship, but when I pointed out that it was only inert matter, you s=\r\naid that it was Surya devata that was the object of worship; when again I p=\r\nointed out that he was only a limited jiva like myself, you said it was Hir=\r\nanyagarbha, the cosmic soul, that was the object of worship: when once agai=\r\nn I pointed out that he was after all a jiva, however cosmic his sense of &=\r\n#39;I&#39; may be, you said that lswara the Lord and Ruler of the universe =\r\nwas really the object of worship; and lastly when I said that even he is bu=\r\nt a relative aspect of Brahman, you said that the object of worship was Bra=\r\nhman itself&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;I did say so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I fail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Where is the difficulty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The object in a particular worship can be only one. How can it be the=\r\n solar orb or the deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Iswara or Brahman =\r\nat the same time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;I never said that=\r\n it was the solar orb or the devil and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Your=\r\n Holiness mean to say then that the object of worship is the solar orb and =\r\nthe devil and Hiranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Nor did I say anything of that sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How then am I to understand Your Holiness&#39; statements?&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;When did I tell you that the upasya w=\r\nas Surya?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned that the physical mass of =\r\nburning matter cannot be the object of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acha=\r\nrya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Before you mentioned it, I said that it was even that mass that =\r\nwas the upasya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=\r\n=A0&lt;/i&gt;I never mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an alter=\r\nnative. To one who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is the=\r\n physical mass; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as an =\r\nobject of worship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever o=\r\nne, but its exact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping aspi=\r\nrant. The upasya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil does=\r\n not satisfy the enquiring devotee. We say then that it is Hiranyagarbha. W=\r\nhen even such a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we tell the devotee=\r\n that he is really worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When he begins to f=\r\neel that even the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential nature, we tel=\r\nl him that it is the infinite Brahman itself that is really worshipped. Whe=\r\nre is the difficulty?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Your Holiness then mean th=\r\nat it is not possible to definitely say what the object of worship in the s=\r\nandhya is except with reference to the mental equipment or intellectual adv=\r\nancement of the worshipper?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;How can=\r\n there be an object of worship if we ignore the worshipper? The nature of t=\r\nhe worshipped necessarily depends upon the nature of the worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Take me for exam=\r\nple. All of you show me respect. But the object of respect, though it is, r=\r\noughly speaking, myself, does differ with each one of you. Ordinary people =\r\nrespect me and like to see me surrounded by glittering paraphernalia; their=\r\n attention and respect are claimed by those articles rather than by my pers=\r\nonality. Such people will show the same respect to others who have similar =\r\nparaphernalia. Their homage is not therefore really paid to me but only to =\r\nthe paraphernalia. Some others respect me for the position that I hold or f=\r\nor the Asrama in which I am. Such people will equally respect others who ar=\r\ne or may come to be in such a position or in such an Asrama, their homage i=\r\ns therefore not paid to me but to my position or to the Asrama. And some ot=\r\nhers may not care what position I hold or in what Asrama I am, but give me =\r\nhomage wherever I go and however I may be; their object of respect is my ph=\r\nysical body. A few others will not mind if my body is dark or ugly or even =\r\ndiseased, but will nevertheless give me homage if by purity of mind and cha=\r\nracter or by the power of my intellect and learning or by any spiritual mer=\r\nit that I may possess I command their respect. Very few indeed will respect=\r\n me for the spark of divine intelligence which inheres in me, as it does in=\r\n all of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it is not possible to say that=\r\n all the devotees that approach Your Holiness are of the same mental equipm=\r\nent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. But, ordinarily all th=\r\nese people, whether they really tender homage to the paraphernalia or to my=\r\n status and Asrama or to my body or to my mind or to my intellect or to the=\r\n divine spark in me, prostrate before me to show their respect. Can you tel=\r\nl me, apart from any reference to the several devotees, to whom or to what =\r\nthey prostrate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no doubt very difficult to answ=\r\ner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Similarly, with every kind of wors=\r\nhip. Externally viewed, there will be no appreciable difference between the=\r\n one who respects me for the paraphernalia and another who respects me for =\r\nthe divine spark in me. Externally viewed, there will similarly be no appre=\r\nciable difference between the devotee who in his blind faith is content to =\r\naddress his prayers to the luminous Sun and another who turns to it as a vi=\r\nsible symbol of the infinite Brahman. The question as to what is the upasya=\r\n in the sandhya worship can therefore be answered only in this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now understand how in the simple worship of the Sun all po=\r\nssible stages in spiritual perception have been provided for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is not only this, for you will find if you consi=\r\nder the matter still further, that all the three ways known as karma, bhakt=\r\ni and Gyana have been given places in the daily worship, but that is a diff=\r\nerent matter. Simple as the sandhya worship seems to be, it is sufficient t=\r\no help us on to the highest stages. It is as useful to the highest aspirant=\r\n as it is to the beginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value =\r\nor to neglect it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;O=\r\nn Sat, Jul 16, 2011 at 11:00 PM, Ananda Kishora Dadi &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:varaha_2000@...&quot;&gt;varaha_2000@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;b=\r\norder-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size=\r\n:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0W=\r\nho is the deity for Gayatri mantra, if we use it in=A0Homa?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0=A0=A0 How to use this great mantra in Homam, if it is=A0corr=\r\nect to use it in homam?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0=A0=A0 Who is deity fo=\r\nr all mighty SUN?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank youu,=A0&lt;/div&gt;Ananda \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--bcaec5215f7318877d04a83dbc24--\r\n\n"}}
