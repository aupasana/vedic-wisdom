Even great jn=\r\naanis are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; occasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand un=\r\nmanifested non-dual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the=\r\n dual world fully ever. She is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; capable of deluding even the greate=\r\nst sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one ventures into duality.=\r\n She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She &lt;BR&gt;&gt; does and why She=\r\n does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with He=\r\nr is to surrender to Her power *fully*.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the other =\r\nhand we are all a part of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW, though we are all =\r\npart of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In the non-dua=\r\nl field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hav=\r\ne differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide what &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krish=\r\nna is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of=\r\n the dual world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 ka=\r\nlas, He can do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; things in the dual world that are impossib=\r\nle for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Realizing the non-dual Self is something th=\r\nat is possible for anyone, but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there are limits imposed on what th=\r\nings one can do in the dual world, based &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the force of previous =\r\nconditioning. Thus, all are the same at one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (non-dual) level and a=\r\nll are different at another (dual) level.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But it is tough =\r\nto know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; point hol=\r\nds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; should be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; same, but because we have no surefire way to know who is what.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagannath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 P=\r\nM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; || Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. W=\r\ne 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Pa=\r\ntel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore d=\r\naily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only =\r\nabout Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore=\r\n he suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call=\r\n me. I shall have to go now=E2?=9D. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a p=\r\nlane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also =\r\nhappened. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by =\r\nBus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through =\r\nbus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bu=\r\ns station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; punctur=\r\ned&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishan=\r\ndev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. On=\r\ne day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2?Ts house befo=\r\nre Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de=\r\neply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussio=\r\nn with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea.=\r\n As my duty was to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I h=\r\nave&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wi=\r\nfe was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with=\r\n me a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy should you take such a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dec=\r\nision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Ka=\r\nli at Calcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Sai=\r\nnt but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; g=\r\nive&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Sh=\r\nri Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you ar=\r\ne doing Gayatri Mantra=E2?=9D--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments =\r\nwere right at her place as people in general not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I=\r\n have taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence o=\r\nf Mr. Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel h=\r\nad told me that Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples t=\r\no test him before accepting him. I also decided to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nest Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have als=\r\no not seen him. He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe th=\r\nat my selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2?=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2?oHow it is possible? I do=\r\nn=E2?Tt believe.=E2?=9D-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nprayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2?~I want to test your existenc=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in th=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what =\r\nhappened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just=\r\n come to my home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried t=\r\no sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my =\r\nblanket and told me that-=E2?o Go to your friend=E2?Ts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ho=\r\nuse. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I w=\r\nill show you his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; house=E2?=9D&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you =\r\nwant? Why you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him i=\r\nn such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget=\r\n that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I wi=\r\nll&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it sometime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive o=\r\nn the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earth.
