It is a bad idea to do a \ndifferent homam everyday.\n\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa used to say &quot;if you want, dig deep in one place. \nDon&#39;t dig one foot in one place, another foot in another place and so on&quot;.\n\nPick one deity and one homam and do it continuously for a few months \natleast. It will do something then.\n\nAmavasya is good for worshipping Kaali or Mahalakshmi. Especially \nDeepavali/Diwali is a great day to worship Mahalakshmi. So Her homam is a \ngood idea.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 24, 2008 3:31 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Doing Homa\n\n\n&gt; Greetings\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any guideline for days in week coorelating to do homa for a\n&gt; particular god/goddess.\n&gt; Also the time of the day too.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Diwali is coming in a couple of days, any recommendations for homam\n&gt; along with auspicious time, anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n\n\n"}}
