At one stage, you said &quot;Ahamkara isn&#39;t th=\r\ne dominant cause of I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies&quot;, while I was saying aha=\r\nmkara=3DI-ness. Now, you wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  =3D A=\r\nSMITA   =3D Physical Egotism\n&gt; &gt;   ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D MANAS   =\r\n =3D Astral attachments\n&gt; &gt;   CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D CHITTA   =3D =\r\nCausal Perceptions\n&gt;  \n&gt; So you are acknowledging that I-ness and ahamkara =\r\nare synonyms and referring to ahamkara at astral and causal planes. It is g=\r\nood that you are slowly converging!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I did n=\r\not want to divert from the upanishadic terminology of 19 ideas of individua=\r\nlized consciousness. So I stuck to the term ahamkaara and ignored your refe=\r\nrences to Patanjali. Now that there is some convergence on &quot;ahamkaara&quot;, let=\r\n me address &quot;asmita&quot; mentioned in Patanjali yoga sutras.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; identifica=\r\ntion of the seer with the instrument of\n&gt; &gt; seeing i.e. Physical senses.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; You are assuming that physical senses or physical body is the only inst=\r\nrument of seeing (or experiencing).\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, mind can see, hear, feel=\r\n and experience things even when it is not working with a physical body and=\r\n physical senses. For example, one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; something in a dream wi=\r\nthout the physical eyes seeing anything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, a yogi in deep meditat=\r\nion may see, hear, feel or experience something without the involvement of =\r\neyes, ears and other physical senses.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If such a yogi identifies with =\r\nthe instrument of that experience, i.e. the mind, that too is asmita as per=\r\n Patanjali&#39;s yoga sutra that you quoted. Just as I had an issue earlier wit=\r\nh your limiting of ahamkaara to physical body, I also have an issue with yo=\r\nur limiting of asmita to physical body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, identification with phys=\r\nical body *as well as* identification with mind block one from yoga (commun=\r\nion) with true Self. Both are due to ahamkaara as defined by upanishads. Bo=\r\nth are due to asmita as defined by Patanjali.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.=\r\norg\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; Dear=\r\n Utpalji and Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    If any of you is offended due to my bei=\r\nng explicit with words - it also shows that you people have a lot of scope =\r\nin learning of new ideas!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The second statement says something ra=\r\ndical.

Here is the reason.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    In my first mail (#2704) itself i=\r\nt is explicitly written, that Patanjali has used the exact word &quot;asmita&quot; fo=\r\nr Egoism - which is the I-ness (Ahamkara) in Physical body consciousness - =\r\nthat causes identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing i.e. P=\r\nhysical senses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanakty=\r\norekatmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with t=\r\nhe instrument of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Patanjali has used Asmita inst=\r\nead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   PATANJALI has not used the word AHAMKARA a=\r\nnywhere in his PRECISE AND ESTEEMED sanskrit dissertation on YOGA - he has =\r\nchosen to use the word ASMITA everywhere. E.g.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.  vitarka vichara=\r\nnandasmita rupanugamat samprajnatah -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                  SASMITA SAM=\r\nADHI\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2.

In any case, what is called as Ahamkara in 24 principles of =\r\nSankhya is actually Asmita, which can be very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The idea stated by me was on firm grounds - with reference to Pat=\r\nanjali Sutras and the words of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi. An=\r\nd this idea is there in my first mail, though not the exact table: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  =3D ASMITA   =3D Physical Egotism\n&gt; &gt;   AST=\r\nRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D MANAS    =3D Astral attachments\n&gt; &gt;   CAUSAL I=\r\n-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D CHITTA   =3D Causal Perceptions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Also, on=\r\ne of the 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don&#39;t =\r\nhave sense of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness is this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sinc=\r\ne astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see, h=\r\near, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogi)... the s=\r\nense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body &gt; and hence doesn&#39;t c=\r\nreate Astral Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought t=\r\no sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while th=\r\ne consciousness is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; associated with the Physical Body sensory activit=\r\nies or has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Lastly, extending upon this id=\r\nea further, there are beings in the Astral cosmos who have never been in Ph=\r\nysical forms - We Physical beings are not the only ones in the cycles of cr=\r\neation. While they will still have the idea of &quot;Asmita&quot; in their causal bod=\r\nies, but they will always be repelled by the grosser-vibrations of Sensual =\r\nexperiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, and hence would not incur any Physic=\r\nal Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; &gt; [ TO ALL IN THE LIST ]  \n&gt; &gt;   - If the above=\r\n explanation resolves the issue, well and good.

My comments on that is:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innat=\r\ne power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal=\r\n and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other,=\r\n and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a per=\r\nson in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently d=\r\nue to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinate=\r\ns the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interac=\r\nt with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have prop=\r\nosed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, n=\r\not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRegards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness,=\r\n which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is aham=\r\nkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;=\r\ns idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone=\r\n says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if =\r\nsomeone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One=\r\n&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even tho=\r\nugh nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being use=\r\nd. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on =\r\nthe physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am b=\r\neing called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one=\r\n&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally=\r\n about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;=\r\nI&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see=\r\n&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happenin=\r\ng to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, the=\r\nre is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara o=\r\nr I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is =\r\nlimited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness ext=\r\nends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that de=\r\nities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have phys=\r\nical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I=\r\n am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would n=\r\not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas=\r\n of individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we us=\r\ne the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, bu=\r\nddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, i=\r\nnteracts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then mana=\r\ns interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various =\r\nthings. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to ty=\r\npe this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what =\r\nexists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of=\r\n I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor=\r\n mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized conscious=\r\nness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in dif=\r\nferent ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belo=\r\nng to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in =\r\nthe physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those wit=\r\nhout a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara =\r\nlike we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and bud=\r\ndhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the =\r\nsense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all =\r\nlayers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. W=\r\nhere did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line b=\r\netween the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense =\r\nof I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed =\r\nof the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (R=\r\nesurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamka=\r\nra including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a c=\r\nausal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists =\r\nas a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of th=\r\ne 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the res=\r\nt of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring a=\r\nnother idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere w=\r\nith the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces a=\r\nnd so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body=\r\n are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each ot=\r\nher. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness de=\r\nrived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their =\r\nfunctioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any w=\r\nay by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpes=\r\nt Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they di=\r\ndn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nindividualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Phy=\r\nsical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn=\r\n&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who c=\r\nan always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what =\r\nis &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness for a physic=\r\nal-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bod=\r\nied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consci=\r\nousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as =\r\nthe very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Howe=\r\nver, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is =\r\nwhy it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and rei=\r\nncarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Dev=\r\natas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in a=\r\nll their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladh=\r\nara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamk=\r\nara that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; o=\r\nr that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. D=\r\nevatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to=\r\n influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pre=\r\ntas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well=\r\n as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of =\r\nthe four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mi=\r\nnd) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. A=\r\ns per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19=\r\n ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions=\r\n of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ide=\r\nas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one o=\r\nr two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal=\r\n bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousn=\r\ness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at differen=\r\nt times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be =\r\ntermed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I=\r\n wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of A=\r\nhamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Su=\r\nbtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causa=\r\nl Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can b=\r\ne developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Mo=\r\nodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so =\r\non...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chi=\r\ntta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. Howev=\r\ner, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability t=\r\no act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an i=\r\nnflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required f=\r\nor That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nid=\r\nra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while=\r\n the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents th=\r\ne SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chi=\r\ntta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Sa=\r\ntva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on i=\r\ntself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its =\r\nown nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjal=\r\ni Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing.=\r\n Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bo=\r\ndied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste =\r\nand so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not t=\r\nake roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similar=\r\nly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is =\r\nassociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-=\r\nconsciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read aut=\r\nobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only=\r\n those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye A=\r\nstral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasi=\r\nng to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in th=\r\ne same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishna=\r\nsya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect whi=\r\nch comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen=\r\n or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivek=\r\nananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness t=\r\no Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bo=\r\ndied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7.
