If you understand that much, the rest in my mail does not matter =\r\nmuch.\n \nThe great Adi Shankara said &quot;bhaja govindam bhaja govindam bhaja go=\r\nvindam moodhamate, sampraapte sannihite kaale na hi na hi rakshati dunkrun =\r\nkarane&quot;.

One is saved only when one of the two happens. The former is v=\r\nery very difficult in this age. One gets a little bit of knowledge and then=\r\n pride increases. It is very difficult to maintain humility and achieve pur=\r\nity through knowledge alone.\n \nThe latter is an easier path in this age. Su=\r\nrrender to a deity and look at yourself as a servant of that deity. When th=\r\ne deity gives you something, do not let it increase your pride and think of=\r\n everything as a property of the deity and continue to look at yourself as =\r\na servant of the deity.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhatever path you choose, d=\r\no some sadhana practically and on a regular basis. Without that, it is diff=\r\nicult to progress.\n \nAlso, do not look at sadhana as an half hour or one ho=\r\nur or two hour thing. The meditation or pooja or homam or some other ritual=\r\n you do alone is not sadhana. Every thought and action is a part of your sa=\r\ndhana. Install a 24 hour surveillance camera to alert you when thieves call=\r\ned pride and ego enter the home called your heart. Constant contemplation t=\r\no control the mind should be as much a part of one&#39;s sadhana as meditation =\r\nor pooja or homam or a ritual.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n=\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \n  From: Ashwin Rawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monda=\r\ny, January 19, 2009 11:02 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Curious abou=\r\nt the real meaning of Bijaksharas: Still not satisfied\n\n        Dear Sir, \n=\r\n        The questions and answers both are beyond my reach.

You are correct that &quot;we are no longer \n          talking about ph=\r\nysical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental \n          ene=\r\nrgy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind&quot;.\n\n          Mind is the c=\r\nonnection between what you called external universe and what \n          you=\r\n called the deeper non-material universe. Mind has access to ALL realms \n  =\r\n        of experience, but it normally focuses on the physical/material rea=\r\nlm. \n          Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm of expe=\r\nrience through \n          effort, it is not easy.\n\n          Let me give a =\r\nsmall analogy.\n\n          If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic =\r\nbeing (who thinks all that \n          all of us think, who desires all that=\r\n all of us desire, who knows all that \n          all of us know, and who do=\r\nes all that all of us do) is like the bottommost \n          layer of ocean.=\r\n Various deities are like intermediate layers. Various \n          objects o=\r\nf the external material world that are perceived by our senses are \n       =\r\n   like the ripples on the surface of the ocean. Objects on the surface \n  =\r\n        perceive other objects on the surface around them. One&#39;s body and t=\r\nhe senses \n          attached to it are an object on the surface in the ana=\r\nlogy. When one&#39;s mind \n          identifies &quot;self&quot; with that body and its s=\r\nenses, it perceives objects as \n          perceived by those senses. When o=\r\nne successfully detaches mind from that \n          self-identity and identi=\r\nfies with another object in the ocean in a different \n          layer, one =\r\nmay perceive a different reality. An example was in yesterday&#39;s \n          =\r\nmail on mystical experiences.\n\n          Just as the ocean is vast and deep=\r\n and has infinite objects at infinite \n          depths, this universe has =\r\ninfinite possible self-identities. As one&#39;s \n          self-awareness is fo=\r\ncused on a specific object, one has specific \n          experience/percepti=\r\n on of self and &quot;others&quot;. When self-awareness changes to a \n          diffe=\r\nrent object, one has a different experience/percepti on of self and \n      =\r\n    &quot;others&quot;. However, this is theoretical discussion for most people, as t=\r\nhey \n          cannot imagine self-awareness changing. The self-awareness o=\r\nf most people is \n          focused on their body with its senses and their=\r\n experience/percepti on of \n          self is the body and &quot;others&quot; is vari=\r\nous objects as perceived through the \n          senses attached to that bod=\r\ny. But, it IS possible for one&#39;s self-awareness \n          to go from an ob=\r\nject on the ocean surface in the analogy to a layer in the \n          mdidl=\r\ne of the ocean or even a bottommost layer.\n\n          Repetition of a mantr=\r\na is only a tool for calming down the mental activity \n          that keeps=\r\n feeding this self-awareness. Mind is identifying with a physical \n        =\r\n  object made with gross matter (body). By keeping it busy with a particula=\r\nr \n          repetitive activity, you have a chance of cutting off its iden=\r\ntification \n          with that object. As an analogy, suppose a kid saw a =\r\nrope right next to him \n          and thought it was a snake and was scared=\r\n. You may tell him no, but still \n          the thought &quot;snake is next to m=\r\ne&quot; will keep scaring him. If you keep him \n          busy with an activity =\r\nthat he immerses in, the thought of snake next to him \n          may vanish=\r\n from his mind slowly.\n\n          Once the identification of mind with the =\r\nbody is cut off or weakened, mind \n          will have to identify with som=\r\nething else. Imagine a frog clinging to a rock \n          on an ocean surfa=\r\nce. If it is afraid of slipping and holds on the rock \n          tightly, i=\r\nts thoughts are on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking \n          a=\r\nbout rock and becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the=\r\n \n          rock. If it starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of so=\r\nmething else \n          on the way to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will dro=\r\np all the way to the \n          ocean bed. Though that is not a bad thing a=\r\nt all, the frog is afraid of it \n          and instinctively grabs somethin=\r\ng on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind \n          will get a hold of a=\r\nnother object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) \n          and develo=\r\np another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. \n         =\r\n In the example from last night, the perception of &quot;I&quot; was not the body, bu=\r\nt \n          a tiny particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberat=\r\ned with the \n          sound of a beejaakshara. The perception of &quot;others&quot; =\r\nwas millions of \n          particles of the same wave of energy engaged in =\r\nmaking the same sound and \n          aborbed in the same sound.\n\n          =\r\nLet me come back to what you wrote: &quot;if mantra is to have ANY enlightening =\r\n\n          effect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself. ... We are no l=\r\nonger \n          talking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of n=\r\non-material mental \n          energy - the mental equivalent of sound in th=\r\ne mind.&quot;\n\n          Mind or individualized consciousness is just a window t=\r\no the universe. If a \n          room has window on the east, you see what i=\r\ns on the east. If a room has \n          window on the west, you see what is=\r\n on the west. And so on. The sound of the \n          mantra IS resonating s=\r\nomewhere (actually, everywhere) in the universe. A \n          mind with a s=\r\ntrong self-identification with a body is bombarded by the sense \n          =\r\ninputs of that body, just as a room with an open window on the south is \n  =\r\n        filled with cold wind blowing from the south and bombarded by the \n=\r\n          floodlights installed outside on the south. You have to close tha=\r\nt window \n          and open window elsewhere to get something else. If sel=\r\nf-identification with \n          body is weakened, the bombardment of sense=\r\n inputs weakens and the window of \n          mind can open to the mantra th=\r\nat resonates in the universe.\n\n          When I said earlier that a vaccum =\r\nshould be created in the mind for the \n          mantra and the deity to fi=\r\nll, this is what I was referring to.\n\n          * * *\n\n          Different =\r\nobjects of the universe, including human beings and deities, are \n         =\r\n made up of gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each object of the \n  =\r\n        universe has different perceptions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. Each object=\r\n of the \n          universe has different energies, i.e. different abilitie=\r\ns to affect \n          interactions between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;.\n\n          Th=\r\ne energy of an object is the energy that brought that object into being. \n =\r\n         Deities are objects with tremendous energy. But one cannot get clo=\r\nse to a \n          deity unless one overcomes attachment to individualized =\r\nego and its \n          potential energy. One needs to convert that potentia=\r\nl energy into kinetic \n          energy that helps one break away from that=\r\n ego and approach a deity.\n\n          In the long run, none of those object=\r\ns is permanent. None of those energies \n          is permanent. In terms of=\r\n the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to an \n          object on th=\r\ne way to the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is to not \n         =\r\n view any object as &quot;I&quot; and not consider any energy as &quot;mine&quot;. The final go=\r\nal \n          is to drop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, =\r\nwithout any \n          sense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;.\n\n          * =\r\n* *\n\n          Please realize two fundamental things:\n\n          (1) The en=\r\nergy of the mantra is experienced *after* the sadhana is fruitful \n        =\r\n  and one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indirect tool for overcoming ego.=\r\n If \n          one thinks that he is doing a powerful mantra and its energy=\r\n will free him \n          from ego, one is mistakened. One MUST put in cons=\r\ncious effort with constant \n          contemplation to weed out ego and pri=\r\nde to make one&#39;s sadhana fruitful. \n          Mantra does not replace that =\r\nneed. Instead, it works hands in hand with that \n          and depends on t=\r\nhat.\n\n          (2) When one succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a =\r\nmantra, one \n          should not think that &quot;I did it&quot; or &quot;I created that =\r\nenergy in my mind&quot;. One \n          does not do anything (other than *undoin=\r\ng* what one did previously, viz \n          putting together of a complex an=\r\nd weird self-identity called a body with so \n          many things attached=\r\n to it and so many pre-conceived notions about the \n          world). The e=\r\nnergy of the mantra IS already there and resonating everywhere. \n          =\r\nWhen mind experiences that energy and fills with it, it is simply *tuning* =\r\n\n          to something pre-existing and not really creating something or d=\r\noing \n          something. It is like a radio tuning to a different channel=\r\n and one \n          listening to newer and better music or a driver driving=\r\n on a different \n          scenic road and viewing beautiful and better sce=\r\nnery.\n\n          * * *\n\n          &gt; If all repetitive chanting were equal, =\r\nmantra shastra would be\n          &gt; 1/2 a page of text, not more.\n\n        =\r\n  I never said they were equal. Perfect absorption into different mantras \n=\r\n          fills the mind with different kinds of enegies (associated with d=\r\nifferent \n          deities). So there is a lot of difference to chronicle.=\r\n In terms of my ocean \n          analogy, the possible experiences when one=\r\n is absorbed into a mantra are as \n          vast as an ocean.\n\n          B=\r\nut, the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlty absorbed into the mantra=\r\n \n          and a vacuum has to be created in the mind for the mantra and i=\r\nts deity to \n          fill. Other factors related to the specific details =\r\nin each mantra are \n          secondary. I want to de-emphasize all other t=\r\nhings and emphasize this \n          essential thing, i.e. control over ego.=\r\n\n\n          One wanting to drive a car on various roads needs a detailed bo=\r\nok giving all \n          the maps. But my point is that one should first le=\r\narn driving. What makes \n          one an expert driver going to various pl=\r\naces is not possession of thousand \n          maps but the basic driving sk=\r\nill. One not knowing driving will crash the car \n          even if he posse=\r\nsses thousand maps. One good at driving may manage without \n          maps =\r\ntoo. People emphasize complicated, mystified and nuanced knowledge and \n   =\r\n       forget the basic essence.\n\n          * * *\n\n          I want to cate=\r\ngorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are neither \n          n=\r\necessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress. One may \n   =\r\n       spend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anything.\n\n  =\r\n        If the basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despite =\r\nnot \n          knowing the nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally=\r\n to one who gets \n          some mastery over the essential factors.\n\n     =\r\n     The proof of the pudding is in eating it. Choose any mantra or beejaak=\r\nshara \n          and meditate on it silently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast=\r\n one hour). Sit \n          comfortably with the back, neck and head erect, =\r\neyes closed and mind as calm \n          as possible. Avoid all physical mov=\r\nement and remain as still as you can. If \n          you have an urge to mov=\r\ne, suppress it as long as you can and keep pushing \n          the limit eve=\r\nryday. Try your best to focus the mind on mantra. Do this \n          medita=\r\ntion sitting in the same place, facing the same direction and at \n         =\r\n around the same time everyday. Do this for one year and see for yourself i=\r\nf \n          it does something to you or not, despite not paying attention =\r\nto the \n          technicalities and nuances!\n\n          * * *\n\n          S=\r\nome nuances are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most =\r\n\n          people. For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti an=\r\nd keelaka of \n          the mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nya=\r\nasa. Those are all \n          relevant only to a person of a high level of =\r\nself-awareness, which is not \n          the case with most people.\n\n       =\r\n   Let me give an analogy. There may be some nuances related to how to lift=\r\n the \n          foot up and land the foot while running, to maximize the sp=\r\need. They are \n          irrelevant to a small baby who cannot yet walk and=\r\n only crawls. When the \n          baby learns how to walk and later how to =\r\nrun, those details will most likely \n          come to him naturally. Evem =\r\nwithout them, one will run fine, perhaps a \n          little\n          slow=\r\ner. Thus, there is no point in trying to learn the nuances of running \n    =\r\n      when one is still crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances =\r\nof \n          running may even make one&#39;s learning of walking very slow - i=\r\nt is a \n          distraction!\n\n          * * *\n\n          I answered whate=\r\nver questions I could answer and felt like answering.\n\n          What we ne=\r\ned today is not people who can discuss theory in detail and have \n         =\r\n an intellectual understanding of things. In fact, these things are beyond =\r\n\n          intellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana is far more import=\r\nant. Do not \n          wait till you get technicalities correct. Just start=\r\n sadhana as I mentioned \n          earlier and commit 1-2 hours of your tim=\r\ne everyday and see what happens.\n\n          What sanatana dharma and Vedic =\r\nwisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas \n          who *experience* mant=\r\nras at the highest level and yet remain free from pride \n          and ego =\r\nand become purified instruments of the Mother to carry out Her will \n      =\r\n    with actions of far-reaching consequences without a trace of ego in tho=\r\nse \n          actions. This is possible not by learning technicalities and =\r\nnuances, but by \n          developing devotion, surrender and conscious eff=\r\nort with constant \n          contemplation.\n\n          Best regards,\n      =\r\n    Narasimha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/=\r\nvedic- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home=\r\n.comcast. net\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJ=\r\nagan nath.org\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- - \n\n          ----- Original Message ----- \n          From: &quot;ve=\r\ndicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@ yahoo.com&gt;\n          To: &lt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n          Sent: Friday, January 16, 2009 1:49 PM\n      =\r\n    Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Curious about the real meaning of Bijakshar=\r\nas:\n          Still not satisfied\n\n          &gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n          =\r\n&gt; Thank you very much for your reply. I am still not satisfied with\n       =\r\n   &gt; the answer though, especially since I am sure I can get a lot more\n   =\r\n       &gt; out of you :-)\n          &gt;\n          &gt; See, the explanation that &quot;=\r\nrepetitive chanting calms/anchors the\n          &gt; mind&quot; is only a &quot;placebo&quot;=\r\n of an answer. It does not do any justice\n          &gt; to the obviously high=\r\nly nuanced mantra shastra. If all repetitive\n          &gt; chanting were equa=\r\nl, mantra shastra would be 1/2 a page of text, not\n          &gt; more. So thi=\r\ns explanation does nothing more than appease the\n          &gt; atheistic scie=\r\nntific mind, one that is unwilling to consider (let\n          &gt; alone accep=\r\nt) the non-material part of the universe.\n          &gt;\n          &gt; I am look=\r\ning for a deeper answer that addresses the above concerns.\n          &gt; Plea=\r\nse bear with me in reading the following paragraph in its\n          &gt; entir=\r\nety before replying - I know I am not presenting new\n          &gt; informatio=\r\nn to you, but merely presenting things as I know them, so\n          &gt; you m=\r\nay reply/correct my thinking as appropriate: More\n          &gt; specifically,=\r\n when I read Vivekacudamani, I am led to believe that\n          &gt; the manif=\r\nested universe is all and only the quintuplicated tattwas.\n          &gt; The =\r\ngross human being is no different (i.e. is also quintuplicated\n          &gt; =\r\ntattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deeper non-material\n      =\r\n    &gt; universe. In that deeper universe, which is the source of the\n       =\r\n   &gt; material universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other\n  =\r\n        &gt; things, the antahakarana, which has the\n          &gt; reflecting/co=\r\nnsider ing/theorizing mind that we are all so familiar\n          &gt; with. It=\r\n experiences the quintuplicated universe, yet is directly\n          &gt; part =\r\nof the unquintuplicated universe! At an even deeper level, even\n          &gt;=\r\n this subtle body is a manifestation of the causal body - mahat,\n          =\r\n&gt; which consists of the three gunas. The manifesting/ enlivening agent,\n   =\r\n       &gt; so to speak, is the non-dual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated\n   =\r\n       &gt; consciousness.\n          &gt;\n          &gt; Now, in the above scheme of=\r\n things, how do mantra and diety figure?\n          &gt; Spoken/chanted/ heard =\r\nmantra is nothing more than an &quot;energic&quot;\n          &gt; activity of the most e=\r\nxternal part of the universe i.e. the\n          &gt; quintuplicated tattwa uni=\r\nverse. Clearly this energic activity by\n          &gt; itself, *if* limited to=\r\n the quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,\n          &gt; clearly, we must =\r\naccept that if mantra is to have ANY enlightening\n          &gt; effect, mantr=\r\na must resonate in the mind itself, which is part of\n          &gt; the antaha=\r\nkarana. Right? Now, since mind itself is NON-material,\n          &gt; what doe=\r\ns resonate mean at the mind level? We are no longer talking\n          &gt; abo=\r\nut physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental\n         =\r\n &gt; energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.\n          &gt;\n       =\r\n   &gt; It is this non-material mental energy that I wish to understand when\n =\r\n         &gt; I ask about mantras and beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it=\r\n\n          &gt; tattwa, prana, chitta, ahamkara, manas, karma, what? Why do sp=\r\necific\n          &gt; harmonics of it correspond to specific dieties? What exa=\r\nctly *is* a\n          &gt; diety in terms of the above terminology? What is th=\r\ne cause-effect\n          &gt; relationship between harmonics of this energy an=\r\nd the disintegration\n          &gt; of the subtle and causal bodies.\n         =\r\n &gt;\n          &gt; Hope you appreciate the direction/thrust of my querying..\n  =\r\n        &gt;\n          &gt; Sincerely,\n          &gt;\n          &gt; Sundeep\n          =\r\n&gt;\n          &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I=\r\nt wanders from one place to another\n          &gt; very rapidly\n          &gt;&gt; a=\r\nnd gives varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadness\n          &gt; e=\r\ntc. When the\n          &gt;&gt; mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one =\r\ncan experience\n          &gt; the bliss of\n          &gt;&gt; finding the true Self.=\r\n The goal of all spiritual sadhana - japam,\n          &gt; homam,\n          &gt;&gt;=\r\n dhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - is to enable the mind\n       =\r\n   &gt; to become\n          &gt;&gt; calm.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; At first, one c=\r\nannot make the mind stable and calm. All one can do\n          &gt; it to tie\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; the monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still mo=\r\nves\n          &gt; around,\n          &gt;&gt; but its motion is restricted. Once it =\r\ngoes far, the thread tying\n          &gt; it to the\n          &gt;&gt; pole stops it=\r\n from going further away. Similarly, when one tries\n          &gt; to focus on=\r\n\n          &gt;&gt; a mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one constant=\r\nly\n          &gt; brings it\n          &gt;&gt; back to the mantra and thus one&#39;s min=\r\nd tries to stay on the mantra.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is an=\r\n anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries\n          &gt; to become\n      =\r\n    &gt;&gt; calm and stable.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; After trying enough, just=\r\n as monkey tied to a pole may stop\n          &gt; jumping around\n          &gt;&gt; =\r\nand fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop thinking\n        =\r\n  &gt; of so\n          &gt;&gt; many things and become absolutely calm and stable wh=\r\nile repeating\n          &gt; a mantra.\n          &gt;&gt; When all the thoughts ceas=\r\ne and some level of silence comes to the\n          &gt; mind, one\n          &gt;&gt;=\r\n experiences some level of bliss.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; * * *\n         =\r\n &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated b=\r\ny the\n          &gt; mind to aid\n          &gt;&gt; mind to stop wandering from one =\r\nthing to another thing. The goal\n          &gt; is to give\n          &gt;&gt; an anc=\r\nhor for the mind to focus on, instead of jumping everywhere.\n          &gt;&gt;\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; Various sound combinations can be used for this purpose. For\n  =\r\n        &gt; example, one\n          &gt;&gt; can even repeat &quot;I want to find true Se=\r\nlf&quot; constantly. Every\n          &gt; combination of\n          &gt;&gt; sounds is cap=\r\nable of making the mind calm after repeating it\n          &gt; enough. Sound\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; patterns making sense in various languages were used by some\n  =\r\n        &gt; saints and\n          &gt;&gt; messiahs from time to time in the past to=\r\n obtain bliss and those\n          &gt; sound\n          &gt;&gt; patterns are revered=\r\n as being sacred in various religions.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Compared t=\r\no long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are\n          &gt; easier to\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; focus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24\n       =\r\n   &gt; letters/syllables, a\n          &gt;&gt; part of the mind is responsible for =\r\nchanging from one letter to\n          &gt; another and\n          &gt;&gt; there is m=\r\nore mind activity even in a state of high mental focus\n          &gt; on the\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; mantra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly, the task is=\r\n\n          &gt; simpler for\n          &gt;&gt; the mind and it is easier for the min=\r\nd to shut down various tasks\n          &gt; of the\n          &gt;&gt; mind and becom=\r\ne close to being still and silent.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Various syllab=\r\nles can be used for this purpose. These syllables\n          &gt; are called\n  =\r\n        &gt;&gt; beeja aksharas.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; * * *\n          &gt;&gt;\n   =\r\n       &gt;&gt; Beeja means a seed. Beeja akshara means a seed syllable.\n        =\r\n  &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; When mind has absolutely no activity and becomes complete=\r\nly still\n          &gt; (i.e.\n          &gt;&gt; ceases to exist!), one realizes the=\r\n true Self (Aatman or Brahman).\n          &gt; When mind\n          &gt;&gt; has very=\r\n little activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still\n          &gt; exists, b=\r\nut in\n          &gt;&gt; a very high state of focus and calmness), one realizes d=\r\nifferent\n          &gt; pure\n          &gt;&gt; manifestations of cosmic being.\n    =\r\n      &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; When one meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the=\r\n above state\n          &gt; of high\n          &gt;&gt; mental focus and calmness, on=\r\ne&#39;s mind has no thoughts other than\n          &gt; the\n          &gt;&gt; repetition=\r\n of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a seed\n          &gt; corresponding to=\r\n a\n          &gt;&gt; deity. The energy of that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness w=\r\nhen\n          &gt; one&#39;s mind is\n          &gt;&gt; filled with that syllable and ha=\r\ns no other thoughts in it. In\n          &gt; other words,\n          &gt;&gt; each de=\r\nity is a personifications of the state of a mind that is\n          &gt; focuse=\r\nd on\n          &gt;&gt; the sound of a specific beeja with no other thoughts in i=\r\nt.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; * * *\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Of course, if =\r\none&#39;s mind has many thoughts while repeating a beeja\n          &gt; akshara\n  =\r\n        &gt;&gt; (or any mantra in general), one may experience a lot of emotions=\r\n\n          &gt; and things.\n          &gt;&gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly s=\r\ntill and calm with no thought\n          &gt; in it\n          &gt;&gt; (other than wh=\r\nat is needed for repeating that sound), we can say\n          &gt; that one&#39;s\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; individual ego has been replaced with that of a deity and the\n =\r\n         &gt; deity has\n          &gt;&gt; filled one&#39;s mind.\n          &gt;&gt;\n         =\r\n &gt;&gt; Thus, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one\n          &gt; ex=\r\nperience the\n          &gt;&gt; energy of a deity.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; * * =\r\n*\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Which syllables make one experience which energ=\r\ny was well-\n          &gt; understood and\n          &gt;&gt; catalogued by ancient H=\r\nindu sages nicely.\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; Many mantras other than beeja =\r\naksharas were also experiemented by\n          &gt; rishis,\n          &gt;&gt; who un=\r\nderstood the nature of energy experienced by one&#39;s mind when\n          &gt; on=\r\ne&#39;s\n          &gt;&gt; mind is completely filled with the sound of the mantra and=\r\n all\n          &gt; other\n          &gt;&gt; thoughts leave the mind.\n          &gt;&gt;\n =\r\n         &gt;&gt; So we need not experiment newly.

Mind has access to ALL realms &lt;BR&gt;of \n          e=\r\nxperience, but it normally focuses on the physical/material realm. \n       =\r\n   &lt;BR&gt;Though mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm of experience \n=\r\n          through &lt;BR&gt;effort, it is not easy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give a small \n =\r\n         analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic b=\r\neing \n          (who thinks all that &lt;BR&gt;all of us think, who desires all t=\r\nhat all of \n          us desire, who knows all that &lt;BR&gt;all of us know, and=\r\n who does all \n          that all of us do) is like the bottommost &lt;BR&gt;laye=\r\nr of ocean. Various \n          deities are like intermediate layers. Variou=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;objects of the \n          external material world that are perceived =\r\nby our senses are &lt;BR&gt;like \n          the ripples on the surface of the oce=\r\nan. Objects on the surface \n          &lt;BR&gt;perceive other objects on the sur=\r\nface around them. One&#39;s body and \n          the senses &lt;BR&gt;attached to it a=\r\nre an object on the surface in the \n          analogy. When one&#39;s mind &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nidentifies &quot;self&quot; with that body and its \n          senses, it perceives ob=\r\njects as &lt;BR&gt;perceived by those senses. When \n          one successfully de=\r\ntaches mind from that &lt;BR&gt;self-identity and \n          identifies with anot=\r\nher object in the ocean in a different &lt;BR&gt;layer, \n          one may percei=\r\nve a different reality. An example was in yesterday&#39;s \n          &lt;BR&gt;mail o=\r\nn mystical experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as the ocean is vast and \n          dee=\r\np and has infinite objects at infinite &lt;BR&gt;depths, this universe \n         =\r\n has infinite possible self-identities. As one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;self-awareness is \n   =\r\n       focused on a specific object, one has specific &lt;BR&gt;experience/percep=\r\nti \n          on of self and &quot;others&quot;. When self-awareness changes to a \n  =\r\n        &lt;BR&gt;different object, one has a different experience/percepti on of=\r\n \n          self and &lt;BR&gt;&quot;others&quot;. However, this is theoretical discussion =\r\nfor \n          most people, as they &lt;BR&gt;cannot imagine self-awareness chang=\r\ning. The \n          self-awareness of most people is &lt;BR&gt;focused on their b=\r\nody with its \n          senses and their experience/percepti on of &lt;BR&gt;self=\r\n is the body and \n          &quot;others&quot; is various objects as perceived throug=\r\nh the &lt;BR&gt;senses \n          attached to that body. But, it IS possible for =\r\none&#39;s self-awareness \n          &lt;BR&gt;to go from an object on the ocean surfa=\r\nce in the analogy to a \n          layer in the &lt;BR&gt;mdidle of the ocean or e=\r\nven a bottommost \n          layer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Repetition of a mantra is only a =\r\ntool for calming down \n          the mental activity &lt;BR&gt;that keeps feeding=\r\n this self-awareness. Mind \n          is identifying with a physical &lt;BR&gt;ob=\r\nject made with gross matter \n          (body). By keeping it busy with a pa=\r\nrticular &lt;BR&gt;repetitive activity, \n          you have a chance of cutting o=\r\nff its identification &lt;BR&gt;with that \n          object. As an analogy, suppo=\r\nse a kid saw a rope right next to him \n          &lt;BR&gt;and thought it was a s=\r\nnake and was scared. You may tell him no, \n          but still &lt;BR&gt;the thou=\r\nght &quot;snake is next to me&quot; will keep scaring him. \n          If you keep him=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;busy with an activity that he immerses in, the \n          thought of s=\r\nnake next to him &lt;BR&gt;may vanish from his mind \n          slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Onc=\r\ne the identification of mind with the body is cut \n          off or weakene=\r\nd, mind &lt;BR&gt;will have to identify with something else. \n          Imagine a=\r\n frog clinging to a rock &lt;BR&gt;on an ocean surface. If it is \n          afrai=\r\nd of slipping and holds on the rock &lt;BR&gt;tightly, its thoughts are \n        =\r\n  on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking &lt;BR&gt;about rock and \n      =\r\n    becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the \n        =\r\n  &lt;BR&gt;rock. If it starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of \n       =\r\n   something else &lt;BR&gt;on the way to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will \n    =\r\n      drop all the way to the &lt;BR&gt;ocean bed. Though that is not a bad thing=\r\n \n          at all, the frog is afraid of it &lt;BR&gt;and instinctively grabs so=\r\nmething \n          on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind &lt;BR&gt;will get a=\r\n hold of \n          another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;and develop \n          another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of &quot;I&quot;=\r\n and &quot;others&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;In \n          the example from last night, the perceptio=\r\nn of &quot;I&quot; was not the body, \n          but &lt;BR&gt;a tiny particle in a tremendo=\r\nus wave of energy that \n          reverberated with the &lt;BR&gt;sound of a beej=\r\naakshara. The perception of \n          &quot;others&quot; was millions of &lt;BR&gt;particl=\r\nes of the same wave of energy \n          engaged in making the same sound a=\r\nnd &lt;BR&gt;aborbed in the same \n          sound.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me come back to wha=\r\nt you wrote: &quot;if mantra is to \n          have ANY enlightening &lt;BR&gt;effect, =\r\nmantra must resonate in the mind \n          itself. ... We are no longer &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;talking about physical energy \n          (sound), we are talking of non-m=\r\naterial mental &lt;BR&gt;energy - the mental \n          equivalent of sound in th=\r\ne mind.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mind or individualized \n          consciousness is just a w=\r\nindow to the universe. If a &lt;BR&gt;room has \n          window on the east, you=\r\n see what is on the east. If a room has \n          &lt;BR&gt;window on the west, =\r\nyou see what is on the west. And so on. The \n          sound of the &lt;BR&gt;man=\r\ntra IS resonating somewhere (actually, everywhere) \n          in the univer=\r\nse. A &lt;BR&gt;mind with a strong self-identification with a \n          body is =\r\nbombarded by the sense &lt;BR&gt;inputs of that body, just as a room \n          w=\r\nith an open window on the south is &lt;BR&gt;filled with cold wind blowing \n     =\r\n     from the south and bombarded by the &lt;BR&gt;floodlights installed outside =\r\n\n          on the south. You have to close that window &lt;BR&gt;and open window =\r\n\n          elsewhere to get something else. If self-identification with &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;body \n          is weakened, the bombardment of sense inputs weakens and t=\r\nhe window of \n          &lt;BR&gt;mind can open to the mantra that resonates in t=\r\nhe \n          universe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I said earlier that a vaccum should be =\r\ncreated \n          in the mind for the &lt;BR&gt;mantra and the deity to fill, th=\r\nis is what I \n          was referring to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different obj=\r\nects of the \n          universe, including human beings and deities, are &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;made up of \n          gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each objec=\r\nt of the \n          &lt;BR&gt;universe has different perceptions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;othe=\r\nrs&quot;. Each \n          object of the &lt;BR&gt;universe has different energies, i.e=\r\n. different \n          abilities to affect &lt;BR&gt;interactions between &quot;I&quot; and=\r\n \n          &quot;others&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The energy of an object is the energy that bro=\r\nught \n          that object into being. &lt;BR&gt;Deities are objects with tremen=\r\ndous \n          energy. But one cannot get close to a &lt;BR&gt;deity unless one =\r\novercomes \n          attachment to individualized ego and its &lt;BR&gt;potential=\r\n energy. One \n          needs to convert that potential energy into kinetic=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;energy that \n          helps one break away from that ego and approach=\r\n a deity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the \n          long run, none of those objects is perma=\r\nnent. None of those energies \n          &lt;BR&gt;is permanent. In terms of the p=\r\nrevious ocean analogy, one may \n          cling on to an &lt;BR&gt;object on the =\r\nway to the ocean bed temporarily, but \n          the final goal is to not &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;view any object as &quot;I&quot; and not consider \n          any energy as &quot;mine&quot;.=\r\n The final goal &lt;BR&gt;is to drop down all the way \n          to the ocean bed=\r\n and stay there, without any &lt;BR&gt;sense of &quot;I&quot; and \n          &quot;others&quot; or &quot;e=\r\nnergy&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please realize two \n          fundamental thing=\r\ns:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced \n          *after* th=\r\ne sadhana is fruitful &lt;BR&gt;and one overcomes ego. The mantra \n          is a=\r\nn indirect tool for overcoming ego. If &lt;BR&gt;one thinks that he is \n         =\r\n doing a powerful mantra and its energy will free him &lt;BR&gt;from ego, one \n  =\r\n        is mistakened. One MUST put in conscious effort with constant \n    =\r\n      &lt;BR&gt;contemplation to weed out ego and pride to make one&#39;s sadhana \n  =\r\n        fruitful. &lt;BR&gt;Mantra does not replace that need. Instead, it works =\r\n\n          hands in hand with that &lt;BR&gt;and depends on that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) When=\r\n one \n          succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;should \n          not think that &quot;I did it&quot; or &quot;I created that energy in=\r\n my mind&quot;. One \n          &lt;BR&gt;does not do anything (other than *undoing* wh=\r\nat one did \n          previously, viz &lt;BR&gt;putting together of a complex and=\r\n weird \n          self-identity called a body with so &lt;BR&gt;many things attac=\r\nhed to it and \n          so many pre-conceived notions about the &lt;BR&gt;world)=\r\n. The energy of the \n          mantra IS already there and resonating every=\r\nwhere. &lt;BR&gt;When mind \n          experiences that energy and fills with it, =\r\nit is simply *tuning* \n          &lt;BR&gt;to something pre-existing and not real=\r\nly creating something or \n          doing &lt;BR&gt;something. It is like a radio=\r\n tuning to a different channel \n          and one &lt;BR&gt;listening to newer an=\r\nd better music or a driver driving on \n          a different &lt;BR&gt;scenic roa=\r\nd and viewing beautiful and better \n          scenery.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; If all repetitive chanting were \n          equal, mantra shastra would=\r\n be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1/2 a page of text, not \n          more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I never said th=\r\ney were equal. Perfect absorption into \n          different mantras &lt;BR&gt;fil=\r\nls the mind with different kinds of enegies \n          (associated with dif=\r\nferent &lt;BR&gt;deities). So there is a lot of \n          difference to chronicl=\r\ne. In terms of my ocean &lt;BR&gt;analogy, the \n          possible experiences wh=\r\nen one is absorbed into a mantra are as \n          &lt;BR&gt;vast as an ocean.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, the essence is this: Mind has to be \n          perfectlty absorbe=\r\nd into the mantra &lt;BR&gt;and a vacuum has to be created \n          in the mind=\r\n for the mantra and its deity to &lt;BR&gt;fill. Other factors \n          related=\r\n to the specific details in each mantra are &lt;BR&gt;secondary. I \n          wan=\r\nt to de-emphasize all other things and emphasize this &lt;BR&gt;essential \n      =\r\n    thing, i.e. control over ego.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One wanting to drive a car on \n   =\r\n       various roads needs a detailed book giving all &lt;BR&gt;the maps. But my =\r\n\n          point is that one should first learn driving. What makes &lt;BR&gt;one=\r\n an \n          expert driver going to various places is not possession of t=\r\nhousand \n          &lt;BR&gt;maps but the basic driving skill. One not knowing dr=\r\niving will \n          crash the car &lt;BR&gt;even if he possesses thousand maps.=\r\n One good at \n          driving may manage without &lt;BR&gt;maps too. People emp=\r\nhasize complicated, \n          mystified and nuanced knowledge and &lt;BR&gt;forg=\r\net the basic \n          essence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want to categoricall=\r\ny state that the \n          nuances of mantra shastra are neither &lt;BR&gt;neces=\r\nsary nor sufficient for \n          one to achieve spiritual progress. One m=\r\nay &lt;BR&gt;spend decades learning \n          the nuances and yet not achieve an=\r\nything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the basic essence \n          is paid attention to, one ca=\r\nn achieve despite not &lt;BR&gt;knowing the \n          nuances. In fact, the nuan=\r\nces may come naturally to one who gets \n          &lt;BR&gt;some mastery over the=\r\n essential factors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The proof of the \n          pudding is in eating=\r\n it. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara &lt;BR&gt;and \n          meditate on it si=\r\nlently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit \n          &lt;BR&gt;comfort=\r\nably with the back, neck and head erect, eyes closed and \n          mind as=\r\n calm &lt;BR&gt;as possible. Avoid all physical movement and remain \n          as=\r\n still as you can. If &lt;BR&gt;you have an urge to move, suppress it as \n       =\r\n   long as you can and keep pushing &lt;BR&gt;the limit everyday. Try your best \n=\r\n          to focus the mind on mantra. Do this &lt;BR&gt;meditation sitting in th=\r\ne \n          same place, facing the same direction and at &lt;BR&gt;around the sa=\r\nme time \n          everyday. Do this for one year and see for yourself if &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;it does \n          something to you or not, despite not paying attention=\r\n to the \n          &lt;BR&gt;technicalities and nuances!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some=\r\n nuances are \n          not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant =\r\nto most &lt;BR&gt;people. \n          For example, people religiously mention beej=\r\na, shakti and keelaka of \n          &lt;BR&gt;the mantra and do detailed anga nya=\r\nasa and kara nyaasa. Those are \n          all &lt;BR&gt;relevant only to a person=\r\n of a high level of self-awareness, \n          which is not &lt;BR&gt;the case wi=\r\nth most people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give an \n          analogy. There may be some=\r\n nuances related to how to lift the &lt;BR&gt;foot \n          up and land the foo=\r\nt while running, to maximize the speed. They are \n          &lt;BR&gt;irrelevant =\r\nto a small baby who cannot yet walk and only crawls. \n          When the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;baby learns how to walk and later how to run, those \n          details wi=\r\nll most likely &lt;BR&gt;come to him naturally. Evem without them, \n          one=\r\n will run fine, perhaps a &lt;BR&gt;little&lt;BR&gt;slower. Thus, there is no \n        =\r\n  point in trying to learn the nuances of running &lt;BR&gt;when one is still \n  =\r\n        crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances of &lt;BR&gt;running m=\r\nay \n          even make one&#39;s learning of walking very slow - it is a \n    =\r\n      &lt;BR&gt;distraction!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I answered whatever questions I =\r\n\n          could answer and felt like answering.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What we need today =\r\nis not \n          people who can discuss theory in detail and have &lt;BR&gt;an i=\r\nntellectual \n          understanding of things. In fact, these things are b=\r\neyond \n          &lt;BR&gt;intellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana is far m=\r\nore \n          important. Do not &lt;BR&gt;wait till you get technicalities corre=\r\nct. Just \n          start sadhana as I mentioned &lt;BR&gt;earlier and commit 1-2=\r\n hours of your \n          time everyday and see what happens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What s=\r\nanatana dharma and \n          Vedic wisdom need today is a handful of sadha=\r\nkas &lt;BR&gt;who *experience* \n          mantras at the highest level and yet re=\r\nmain free from pride &lt;BR&gt;and \n          ego and become purified instruments=\r\n of the Mother to carry out Her \n          will &lt;BR&gt;with actions of far-rea=\r\nching consequences without a trace of \n          ego in those &lt;BR&gt;actions. =\r\nThis is possible not by learning \n          technicalities and nuances, but=\r\n by &lt;BR&gt;developing devotion, surrender \n          and conscious effort with=\r\n constant &lt;BR&gt;contemplation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n          regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- ---------=\r\n -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri \n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n          target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spi=\r\nrituality: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n          Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. \n          net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSri Jagannath \n          Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijag=\r\nannath.org/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan =\r\n\n          nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- \n          --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: =\r\n\n          &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedicastrostudent%40ya=\r\nhoo.com&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedicastrostudent@ yahoo=\r\n.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: \n          &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogrou=\r\nps. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Friday, \n          January 16, 2009 1:49 PM&lt;BR&gt;Sub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Curious about \n          the real meaning of Bijak=\r\nsharas:&lt;BR&gt;Still not satisfied&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Dear Narasimhaji,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Thank you very much for your reply. I am \n          still not satisfie=\r\nd with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the answer though, especially since I \n          am sure I c=\r\nan get a lot more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; out of you :-)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          See, th=\r\ne explanation that &quot;repetitive chanting calms/anchors \n          the&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; mind&quot; is only a &quot;placebo&quot; of an answer. It does not do any \n          jus=\r\ntice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the obviously highly nuanced mantra shastra. If all \n      =\r\n    repetitive&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chanting were equal, mantra shastra would be 1/2 a \n=\r\n          page of text, not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; more. So this explanation does nothing =\r\nmore \n          than appease the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; atheistic scientific mind, one tha=\r\nt is \n          unwilling to consider (let&lt;BR&gt;&gt; alone accept) the non-ma=\r\nterial part \n          of the universe.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am looking for a =\r\ndeeper answer that \n          addresses the above concerns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Please =\r\nbear with me in reading \n          the following paragraph in its&lt;BR&gt;&gt; e=\r\nntirety before replying - I \n          know I am not presenting new&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n information to you, but merely \n          presenting things as I know them=\r\n, so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you may reply/correct my \n          thinking as appropriate: M=\r\nore&lt;BR&gt;&gt; specifically, when I read \n          Vivekacudamani, I am led t=\r\no believe that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the manifested \n          universe is all and only t=\r\nhe quintuplicated tattwas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The gross \n          human being is no d=\r\nifferent (i.e. is also quintuplicated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          tattwas), but his =\r\nconsciousness is the link to a deeper \n          non-material&lt;BR&gt;&gt; unive=\r\nrse. In that deeper universe, which is the \n          source of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n material universe, there is the subtle body, \n          which has, among o=\r\nther&lt;BR&gt;&gt; things, the antahakarana, which has \n          the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ref=\r\nlecting/consider ing/theorizing mind that we are all so \n          familiar=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with. It experiences the quintuplicated universe, yet \n          i=\r\ns directly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; part of the unquintuplicated universe! At an even \n     =\r\n     deeper level, even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; this subtle body is a manifestation of the =\r\n\n          causal body - mahat,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; which consists of the three gunas. =\r\nThe \n          manifesting/ enlivening agent,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so to speak, is the n=\r\non-dual \n          Brahman, or pure undifferentiated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          con=\r\nsciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now, in the above scheme of things, how \n      =\r\n    do mantra and diety figure?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spoken/chanted/ heard mantra is \n  =\r\n        nothing more than an &quot;energic&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; activity of the most externa=\r\nl \n          part of the universe i.e. the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; quintuplicated tattwa un=\r\niverse. \n          Clearly this energic activity by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; itself, *if* li=\r\nmited to the \n          quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cl=\r\nearly, we must \n          accept that if mantra is to have ANY enlightening=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; effect, \n          mantra must resonate in the mind itself, which =\r\nis part of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \n          antahakarana. Right? Now, since mind itse=\r\nlf is NON-material,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          what does resonate mean at the mind =\r\nlevel? We are no longer \n          talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about physical energy (s=\r\nound), we are talking of \n          non-material mental&lt;BR&gt;&gt; energy - th=\r\ne mental equivalent of sound in \n          the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is =\r\nthis non-material mental energy that I \n          wish to understand when&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; I ask about mantras and beejaksharas. \n          What is this energy=\r\n? Is it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tattwa, prana, chitta, ahamkara, \n          manas, karma, w=\r\nhat? Why do specific&lt;BR&gt;&gt; harmonics of it correspond \n          to speci=\r\nfic dieties? What exactly *is* a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; diety in terms of the \n          a=\r\nbove terminology? What is the cause-effect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; relationship \n          =\r\nbetween harmonics of this energy and the disintegration&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the \n   =\r\n       subtle and causal bodies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hope you appreciate the \n =\r\n         direction/thrust of my querying..&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Since=\r\nrely,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sundeep&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. \n          Rao&quot;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear \n          Sun=\r\ndeep,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite relevant and not at all \n      =\r\n    inappropriate. Let me give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the crux of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the \n       =\r\n   philosophy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The \n =\r\n         mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place to another&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \n          very rapidly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and gives varied emotions such as pri=\r\nde, \n          shame, anger, sadness&lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc. When the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind=\r\n becomes \n          nearly calm, steady and stable, one can experience&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; the bliss \n          of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; finding the true Self. The goal of =\r\nall spiritual \n          sadhana - japam,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; homam,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dhyana=\r\nm, contemplation and \n          various rituals - is to enable the mind&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; to become&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n          calm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; At firs=\r\nt, one cannot make the mind \n          stable and calm. All one can do&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; it to tie&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the \n          monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (man=\r\ntra). The monkey still moves&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          around,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; but its=\r\n motion is restricted. Once it goes far, \n          the thread tying&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; it to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; pole stops it from \n          going further away. S=\r\nimilarly, when one tries&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to focus \n          on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a mantr=\r\na and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one \n          constantly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n brings it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; back to the mantra and thus \n          one&#39;s mind tr=\r\nies to stay on the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus, \n          mantra =\r\nis an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to \n          b=\r\necome&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; calm and stable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; After \n         =\r\n trying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop&lt;BR&gt;&gt; jumping \n   =\r\n       around&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind =\r\n\n          may stop thinking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of so&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; many things and beco=\r\nme \n          absolutely calm and stable while repeating&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a \n       =\r\n   mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When all the thoughts cease and some level of \n     =\r\n     silence comes to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind, one&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; experiences some \n =\r\n         level of bliss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n          Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by =\r\n\n          the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind to aid&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind to stop wandering from =\r\none \n          thing to another thing. The goal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is to give&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; an \n          anchor for the mind to focus on, instead of jumping \n    =\r\n      everywhere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
