The highlighting is done by you, not in the a=\r\nctual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have used some basic grammer to=\r\n remove confusion. He did not. At the level of text, it is indefensible. Al=\r\nso, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari who are pashu, why not Nara=\r\ns who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in=\r\n the world.=C2=A0This explanation=C2=A0 that you found looks more like a ba=\r\nck engineering job to bail out.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nRegarding Rama self realizati=\r\non, I think I was unable to express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me =\r\ntry again. He is not really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized ma=\r\nn. Infact he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says =\r\nis that, (his opinion)=C2=A0God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be =\r\nworshipped. He descended in order to lead by example. That is why the text =\r\nis called Rama+ayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. On=\r\ne of principles.=C2=A0 Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Ma=\r\nhabharata, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot;. One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s=\r\n path. \n=C2=A0\nWhenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama=\r\n, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshippe=\r\nr and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama d=\r\nid. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel man=\r\n, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a life.\n=\r\nAn ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the life of=\r\n a great man.\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, even today lot of people advise that one sh=\r\nould try to become like Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth t=\r\no be like Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a =\r\nself realized=C2=A0saint of highest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=\r\n=C2=A0one who=C2=A0lived like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C2=A0men, fear=\r\nless and uncompromising and principled. If every=C2=A0person would constant=\r\nly think that Vivekanada was a saint=C2=A0who worked by the pwoer of a deit=\r\ny or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C2=A0=\r\nno one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C2=A0emulate his =\r\nway of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C2=A0the image he proje=\r\ncted was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0On the other hand=C2=A0you will never hear anyone advising tha=\r\nt one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=C2=A0=C2=A0That is imposs=\r\nible. He=C2=A0 was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nSimil=\r\nar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C2=A0Ramachandra incomparison to =\r\nSri Krishna. One can become Rama in actions but one can never=C2=A0become K=\r\nrishna. Therefore, my friend believes, one should not consider Rama as a Go=\r\nd to be worshipped, but as a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nHope I have put forth=C2=A0his idea clear.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of =\r\nconsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Tue, 15/12/09, vedic_patha=\r\nk &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@yahoo.=\r\ncom&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

It is =\r\nunderstandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that suc=\r\nh a great person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is =\r\nthe definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some mon=\r\nths back I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him o=\r\nn whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theo=\r\nlogical debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stoppe=\r\nd the debate because I was getting agitated and it would have affected our =\r\nfriendship. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he=\r\n will only mention that what he can support using logic. Therefore he never=\r\n generally discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and d=\r\nebate scriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)=C3=82=C2=A0but not =\r\nabout mysticism or sadhana or anything which=C3=82=C2=A0needs a belief syst=\r\nem. That is why most people know him only as a very rational, massively kno=\r\nwledgeable and uncorruptable=C3=82=C2=A0human being.=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0They have no clue about his meditations or anything. He never projects h=\r\nimself as spiritual and generally would not discuss God in public.\n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Therefore our discussion was also on those aspects which can be pr=\r\noved or disproved theologically=C3=82=C2=A0- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmik=\r\ni Ramayana=C3=82=C2=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; 1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. \n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debated from a spir=\r\nitual point if it is right or wrong=C3=82=C2=A0- but his personal opinion i=\r\ns that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather th=\r\nan worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He=\r\n could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right=\r\n from the place where he was=C3=82=C2=A0located when he first heard the new=\r\ns of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard wa=\r\ny of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more imp=\r\nortant to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; 3) He=\r\n considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of lang=\r\nauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (si=\r\nnce many rules of composition has been flouted) but a critics nightmare. Al=\r\nso, there is a line in there which equates women with animals or something =\r\nsimilar. He believes that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had =\r\na problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sent=\r\nence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped=\r\n as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there =\r\nto explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Kri=\r\nshna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than=\r\n Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; The above are me=\r\nrely his opinions, feel free to disagree. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nDear Utpal,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his=\r\n thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I have been out o=\r\nf touch with him since August, been busy myself. But will ask him. However =\r\nI don&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because as I explained above, he rare=\r\nly discusses/debates anything from a purely spiritual angle. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; It was only by chance that I found out one day about his meditations =\r\netc and then he confirmed them when asked.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I have seen him=\r\n debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific point of view - about why =\r\nthere is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat (not red meat). \n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; But I say, as Narasimha said, this person should not be taken a=\r\ns an ideal regarding food=C3=82=C2=A0 habits.

I met him about two years back. What first attract=\r\ned me to=C3=82=C2=A0 towards him was his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is=\r\n a maniac=C3=82=C2=A0when it comes to=C3=82=C2=A0honestly.=C3=82=C2=A0If so=\r\nmeone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harml=\r\ness=C3=82=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Theref=\r\nore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C3=82=C2=A0s=\r\npoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his=\r\n school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than En=\r\nglish, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is more=\r\n comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. S=\r\nince that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, o=\r\nne Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading the\n English=\r\n dictionary and\n&gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=82=C2=A0When I a=\r\nsked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C3=82=C2=A0equally=\r\n adept at both the languages so that one day he can take a really detached =\r\nview to judge the truth about=C3=82=C2=A0which is more comprehensive langua=\r\nge! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding o=\r\nut the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He h=\r\nas worked in different fields, from banking to education to journalism. He =\r\ndid not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, Englis=\r\nh, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learn=\r\ning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he was in co=\r\nllege, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a job he had ke=\r\npt the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed=\r\n to take the forms saw that blank space,\n he asked\n&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hear=\r\ning a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched =\r\nthe form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Because, he considered =\r\nhimself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. \n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All =\r\nhis friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His w=\r\nay to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He s=\r\nays he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That =\r\nwas at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in =\r\nthe evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked th=\r\ne priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just st=\r\nayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow =\r\nfelt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He=\r\n remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Then he s=\r\ntarted meditating at home, and it was there=C3=82=C2=A0that he got visions =\r\netc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who kn=\r\now him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hou=\r\nrs, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same p=\r\nosition for 3 days continuously.=C3=82=C2=A0 Only his wife and close relati=\r\nves know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for medi=\r\ntation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he =\r\nfelt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginat=\r\nes from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, me=\r\nn, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom a=\r\nnd bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=82=C2=A0He =\r\nconsiders Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=82=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal ma=\r\nn.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it el=\r\nevated\n Sri=C3=82=C2=A0Rama to the\n&gt; level of a God whereas the aim of the =\r\norginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=82=C2=A0n=\r\not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be=\r\n emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But=\r\n a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but o=\r\nne=C3=82=C2=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him ov=\r\ner this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a=\r\n human guru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days=\r\n. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Later he=\r\n had once=C3=82=C2=A0mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the peo=\r\nple around him in his past lives.

The highlighting i=\r\ns done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have=\r\n used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He did not. At the level of t=\r\next, it is indefensible. Also, if I go by your explanation, why only Naari =\r\nwho are pashu, why not Naras who are like pashus? There are more Naaras of =\r\nPashu nature than Naaris in the world.&nbsp;This explanation&nbsp; that you=\r\n found looks more like a back engineering job to bail out.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Regarding Rama self realization, I think I w=\r\nas unable to express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He i=\r\ns not really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he qu=\r\nite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his o=\r\npinion)&nbsp;God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He =\r\ndescended in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+=\r\nayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles=\r\n.&nbsp; Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, whic=\r\nh was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot;. One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to S=\r\nri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the wo=\r\nrshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like=\r\n Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a no=\r\nbel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a=\r\n life.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can =\r\nfollow the life of a great man.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Similarly, eve=\r\nn today lot of people advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda=\r\n, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future=\r\n. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized&nbsp;saint of highest=\r\n calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like&nbsp;one who&nbsp;lived like a lion =\r\namong sheep of ordinary&nbsp;men, fearless and uncompromising and principle=\r\nd. If every&nbsp;person would constantly think that Vivekanada was a saint&=\r\nnbsp;who worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his extreme spirituality =\r\nor the blessing of a great guru,&nbsp;no one will ever make an attempt to b=\r\ne inspired by him or&nbsp;emulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spirit=\r\nual giant, but&nbsp;the image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless =\r\nKarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;On =\r\nthe other hand&nbsp;you will never hear anyone advising that one should try=\r\n to lead a life like Ramarkishna.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is impossible. He&nbsp; w=\r\nas God incarnate leading a charmed life.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri&nbsp;Ramachandra incomparis=\r\non to Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actions but one can never&nbsp;be=\r\ncome Krishna. Therefore, my friend believes, one should not consider Rama a=\r\ns a God to be worshipped, but as a model to be followed. Like Vivekanada.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hope I have put forth&nbsp;his idea clear.&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;E=\r\nM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; C=\r\nOLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=\r\n=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---=\r\n On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 15/12/09, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORD=\r\nER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

It is understandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard=\r\n to believe that such a great person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask=\r\n him what really is the definition of God which differentiates Rama from Kr=\r\nishna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and =\r\ncharged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you,=\r\n these are all theoritical/ theological debates - nothing to do with actual=\r\n spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I was getting agitated=\r\n and it would have affected our friendship. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; W=\r\nhenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that what he=\r\n can support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spirituali=\r\nty with anyone per se. He will\n discuss and debate scriptures using exact q=\r\nuotations etc, (theology)=C3=82&nbsp;but not about mysticism or sadhana or =\r\nanything which=C3=82&nbsp;needs a belief system. That is why most people kn=\r\now him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;human being.=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;They have no clue about his=\r\n meditations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and genera=\r\nlly would not discuss God in public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore=\r\n our discussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved =\r\ntheologically=C3=82&nbsp;- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp; 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C3=82&nbsp;.. 3) The meri=\r\nts of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) T=\r\no the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debated from a spir=\r\nitual point if it is right or wrong=C3=82&nbsp;- but his personal opinion\n =\r\nis that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather t=\r\nhan worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. H=\r\ne could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, righ=\r\nt from the place where he was=C3=82&nbsp;located when he first heard the ne=\r\nws of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard w=\r\nay of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more im=\r\nportant to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodge=\r\npodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s=\r\n paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a critics =\r\nnightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with animals =\r\nor something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text because T=\r\nulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up\n co=\r\nmposing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama=\r\n is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri R=\r\nama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipp=\r\ned because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be=\r\n more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food ha=\r\nbits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have been out of touch=\r\n with him since August, been busy myself.

La=\r\nter someone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the wo=\r\nrld cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself t=\r\nwo thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every d=\r\nay he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one hour re=\r\nading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=82&nbsp;up volumes of Hind=\r\ni and English literature.=C3=82&nbsp;When I asked him why, he just said it =\r\nis because he wanted to be=C3=82&nbsp;equally adept at both the languages s=\r\no that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;which is more\n comprehensive language! As I said, he has an unc=\r\nompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything.=\r\n By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different field=\r\ns, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in mos=\r\nt places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, San=\r\nskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetr=\r\ny in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself=\r\n an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for rel=\r\nigion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that =\r\nblank space, he asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the c=\r\nlerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk=\r\n and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and =\r\nwriting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; So this gives a\n basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friend=\r\ns, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His=\r\n way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He s=\r\nays he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That =\r\nwas at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in =\r\nthe evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked th=\r\ne priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just st=\r\nayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow =\r\nfelt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He=\r\n remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=82&nbsp;that he =\r\ngot visions etc of Krishna.\n He does not say much about these, infact most =\r\npeople who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samad=\r\nhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same pla=\r\nce and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82&nbsp; Only his wife and=\r\n close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he =\r\nsits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone aske=\r\nd him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole uni=\r\nverse orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, th=\r\ne animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller th=\r\nan the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=82&nbsp;Lord Rama to =\r\nbe the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because =\r\nhe thinks it elevated Sri=C3=82&nbsp;Rama to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; level of a God whe=\r\nreas the aim of the orginal Valmiki\n Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an id=\r\neal man,=C3=82&nbsp;not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man =\r\nis someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to becom=\r\ne like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot =\r\nbecome Krishna, but one=C3=82&nbsp;can try to lead his life like Rama. I ha=\r\nve argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he doe=\r\ns not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust =\r\nmost Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later he had once=C3=82&nbsp;mentioned he knew the=\r\n relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His moth=\r\ner he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot=\r\n of time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;with those in=C3=82&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, discussing any=\r\nthing and everything with them, from Indian politics\n to Indian history, re=\r\nligion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who =\r\nwill be the future of this country.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He is am o=\r\nmnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had no=\r\nt asked his permission before mentioning him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n-Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS: I would=\r\n not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.

Do you know him as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of =\r\npath/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Did spec=\r\nific changes happened in his life after=C3=82&nbsp; he had these samadhi an=\r\nd visions.Any other special things about him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In the Gita =\r\nLord is saying\n whatever you do/eat offer it to me first. So he is offering=\r\n all these non-veg to Lord with devotion, Right?? Then prasdam all around??=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My curious questions are not against your acceptance of h=\r\nis exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is part of hidden violence. So=\r\nmebody is inflicting gruesome=C3=82&nbsp; pain and misery on animals and bi=\r\nrds on his behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is experiencing all t=\r\nhese exotic=C3=82&nbsp; visions, But no feeling of kindness towards birds a=\r\nnd animals.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Where did I go wrong? Simple dal/roti and do n=\r\not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; W=\r\nhen we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/arti=\r\ncle=C3=82&nbsp; about Dayamata who succeded=C3=82&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand=\r\n. Once she went to India and told a Spiritual Master that her progress has =\r\nstopped. Master said, you are eating eggs which she admitted that she was d=\r\noing=C3=82&nbsp;\n secretly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is very complex world. No=\r\n outright solutions for so many difficult questions. Followers of 3 faiths =\r\nwhich all originated in middle east are fighting each other all the time. S=\r\nometimes I think, from which part of Spiritual Sky these energies are comin=\r\ng,Are they also enemies there?? Their Gods said in their holy books that an=\r\nimals are their food. So they cannot even think about souls in animals or t=\r\nheir pain and emotions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then I have read stories about sev=\r\neral people, who follow these faiths and are non-veg and how they exexperie=\r\nnce=C3=82&nbsp; spiritual highs and other such phenomena. It is so difficul=\r\nt to comprehend.=C3=82&nbsp; Would they remain in the cycle of b/d=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp; till they learn about kindness???&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n LaxmiNarayan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Sat, 12/12=\r\n/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The INTERNET n=\r\now has a personality.
