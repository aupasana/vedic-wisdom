Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma Pravartaka \nAcharya) as the Resident Sch=\r\nolar and Acharya of our temple.  \n\nThroughout the long history of the Hindu=\r\n religious tradition, Hindu \ntemples have customarily had an officiating Ac=\r\nharya =96 or resident \nteacher =96 who was responsible for the education an=\r\nd spiritual \nguidance of the community, and for conducting spiritual teachi=\r\nng, \nclasses, and instruction.  It is in the spirit of this ancient Hindu \n=\r\ntradition that the Hindu Temple of Nebraska has created this office.  \n\nEve=\r\nn though Hindu temples have existed in America for many decades \nnow, this =\r\nappointment represents the first time in American history \nthat any of the =\r\nover 1000 existing Indian Hindu temples has \nofficially appointed an Achary=\r\na to over see their educational \nactivities.  While this is an ancient offi=\r\nce in India, it is a first \ntime occurrence in the West.  Moreover, it is a=\r\nlso a groundbreaking \ndevelopment that this first ever Acharya is not of In=\r\ndian origin, but \nis a practicing American Hindu of Italian and Spanish eth=\r\nnicity.  \n\nAbout Dr. Morales\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Mora=\r\nles) has been a \npracticing Hindu for the last 30 years.  After living the =\r\nlife of a \ncelibate Hindu monk for six years, Dr. Morales was initiated as =\r\na \nHindu priest in India in 1986.  Dr. Morales went on to earn a B.A. in \np=\r\nhilosophy & theology from Loyola University Chicago; and an M.A. and \nPh.D.=\r\n in Hindu Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \nToday, Sri Ach=\r\naryaji is recognized universally as one of the world&#39;s \nleading scholars on=\r\n Hinduism; as a highly authentic and traditional \nHindu Acharya; and as one=\r\n of the most dynamic, revolutionary, and \nfearless Hindu leaders on the wor=\r\nld scene.  He is the President-\nAcharya of the International Sanatana Dharm=\r\na Society.  His life is \nwholly dedicated to teaching Sanatana Dharma.  His=\r\n followers and \nsupporters number in the thousands and come from both the I=\r\nndian and \nnon-Indian communities.  \n\n\nFor further information about the Hi=\r\nndu Temple of Nebraska or the \nwork of Dr. Frank Morales, please visit us o=\r\nn the web or contact us \ndirectly:  \n\nHindu Temple of Nebraska, 13010 Arbor=\r\n Street, Omaha, Nebraska, 68144.\n\nwww.hindutemplenebraska.org\t\t\nwww.dharmac=\r\nentral.com\t\t\t\ninfo@...\n(402) 896-4294\n\n\n\n\n"}}
