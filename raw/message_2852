Both versions make sense to me, though &quot;tu&quot; seems a bit forced there.\n \nFor others, tvadharma = tu + adharma. It means one who destroys the path of adharma.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere are many ways in which I can make sense of &quot;svadharma-maarga-naashanam&quot;:\n \n(1) The word &quot;maarga&quot; not only means &quot;path&quot;, but also means &quot;search for something&quot;. Thus the whole expression can mean &quot;one who brings to an end the search for swadharma&quot;, i.e. one who clearly shows what one&#39;s dharma is.\n \n(2) The word &quot;maarga&quot; not only means the path you follow, but the track you leave behind. So the whole expression can mean &quot;one who erases the [kaarmik] track left behind by following one&#39;s dharma&quot;. This fits well with the next line which says &quot;karma-paasha-mocakam&quot;, i.e. one who liberates from the chain of actions-and-reactions.\n \n(3) The previous term is &quot;dharma-setu-paalakam&quot; and it means &quot;one who rules the bridge of dharma&quot;. If this samsaara (material world) is like an ocean, dharma is like a bridge that lets one cross the ocean without sinking. However, this is not a 1 mile or 2 mile long bridge. The ocean is infinite and so is the bridge. One can follow one&#39;s dharma forever and yet not reach the end, i.e. be liberated. At some stage, the idea that I am so and so and my dharma is so and so needs to be given up. Of course, this cannot happen forcibly. Giving up swadharma forcefully when one still has self-identification is not moksha, but adharma. However, when one is ready for liberation, one can give up the ideas of self and own dharma and become like a dry leaf being blown here and there by the air. Thus, this expression can mean &quot;one who makes one overcome the concepts of self, dharma etc and liberates one&quot;.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAadi Shankara may have strategically used some expressions to convery several shades of the meaning simultaneously. This Kaala Bhiaravaashtakam is one of the most beautiful compositions by the master philosopher-scholar-teacher-poet.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; As we have all come to expect from you, this is another nice gem. I\n&gt; have a minor question. The fifth verse of the kAla-bhairava-aShTakam\n&gt; in the manual reads: dharma-setu-pAlakam sva-dharma-mArga-nAshanam.\n&gt; \n&gt; In place of &#39;sva-dharma&#39; some internet versions read &#39;tvadharma&#39;,\n&gt; which gives the opposite meaning.
