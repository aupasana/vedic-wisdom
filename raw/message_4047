K=\r\neep doing it as regularly as you can. It can only purify your consciousness=\r\n further and further as you do it more and more.\n\nAs far as &quot;experiences&quot; a=\r\nre concerned, different people will have different experiences. Some people=\r\n with more intuitive and imaginative minds may have visions. Some people wi=\r\nth more logical and rational minds may experience a clarity of mind. But, o=\r\nverall, anyone doing homam on a regular basis will start to love fire, iden=\r\ntify with fire, experience some kind of calmness, bliss and vitality when w=\r\nith fire. The specific experiences and visions are not worth bothering much=\r\n about.\n\nOne person driving a hillside road may see beautiful scenery on th=\r\ne way. He may be charmed by it, keep watching, get stuck there and not reac=\r\nh the top of the hill. Another person driving the road on the other side of=\r\n the hill may not see any scenery, but keep driving and reach the top of th=\r\ne hill and enjoy a perfect view of everything from there.\n\nSimilarly, someo=\r\nne having visions and experiences may become either egoistic or attached an=\r\nd get stuck. Someone having no experiences whatsoever may keep doing sadhan=\r\na and oneday become self-realized.\n\nLike a mother serves each child what is=\r\n good for him/her, Devi can give experiences to some people in order to rei=\r\nnforce their faith. But pay little attention to such experiences and keep d=\r\noing sadhana. THAT is the key.\n\nHari&#39;s words are wise. It is a good idea to=\r\n keep one&#39;s experiences to oneself. Of course, as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa s=\r\naid on another occasion, one having climbed a wall and seen a beautiful hea=\r\nvenly place on the other hand, may want to come back and tell others about =\r\nit. If everyone who climbs the wall jumps on the other side and settles dow=\r\nn there, how will other people know about it? So some people need to do tha=\r\nt job (of coming back into the village and telling people). But realize tha=\r\nt one who does that job stands the chance of getting stuck and never going =\r\nback there. Secondly, one should consider talking about one&#39;s experiences t=\r\no others only after making some progress. Third, one should ensure that non=\r\ne of one&#39;s experiences cause pride in some way or the other.\n\nBest regards,=\r\n\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: ht=\r\ntp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@ gm=\r\nail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Girish,\n&gt; \n&gt; Congratulations on your first Chandi H=\r\nomam.
