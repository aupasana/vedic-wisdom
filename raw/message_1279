The first Homa i did was of &#39;108 MahaMrutunjaya Mantra&#39;.=\r\n The \ninformation and propagation came from &#39;Art of Living&#39;.\n\nIt is intrest=\r\ning Coincidence to note here which i realised yesterday:\n\nMAHA KAALI gave D=\r\narshan to Manishji on 3rd March 2006 and Instructed \nhim to start Homam mov=\r\nement. chain of events happened in that line \nand Narasimha (My Guru) took =\r\nthe task of propagating it.\n\nNow consider this - Sri Sri Ravishankar also s=\r\ntarted propagating \nHomam on Daily basis (15 minutes Agnihotra Homa, MahaMr=\r\nutunjay Homa \netc..) around the same time. AOL came out with a small book f=\r\nor \ndoing Homam everyday, they started supplying Homa Kundam and Cow-\ndung =\r\nblocks for fire rituals. I Purchased the Homa Kundam and \nCowDung Slices fr=\r\nom them when i was in Mumbai and did my couple of \nHomam for MahaMrutunjaya=\r\n Mantra. AOL has a giant numbers of \nfollowers all over the world and its o=\r\nbvious that many people are \ndoing Regulay Homam (As per AOL&#39;s way).\n\naroun=\r\nd the same time Narasimha came out with the first Manual and \nthat was Maha=\r\nGanapati Homa.\n\nThis tells me that, Homam is NOT without reasons. Some divi=\r\nne plan \nis strongly behind this movement which is evident by activities of=\r\n  \nManish & Narasimha, Ravishankar, Shri Maa and others who have \nstarted i=\r\nt on regular basis.\n\nThis were my thoughts. i suddenly realised a Yesterday=\r\n the \ncoincidence mentioned above and thought it proper to put in front of =\r\n\nall the list.\n  \nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Shree=\r\n Maa was referred to here. Someone sent me a few snippets \nfrom an \n&gt; inter=\r\nview posted on her website. Please see below.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesting that s=\r\nhe considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as \nher guru. It \n&gt; is interesting tha=\r\nt Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire \nceremonies and \n&gt; show what is =\r\ntruth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be \npeace&quot;. This \n&gt; is simila=\r\nr to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she \nappeared to \n&gt; him du=\r\nring Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n&gt; \n&gt; She told him that many people are =\r\nand will be born who will \nperform a short \n&gt; fire ritual on a regular basi=\r\ns, establish sanatana dharma and \npeace in the \n&gt; world and also make quick=\r\n spiritual progress individually in that \nprocess. \n&gt; Shree Maa&#39;s statement=\r\n about what Ramakrishna told her is along \nsimilar \n&gt; lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; My guru w=\r\nas also told by Mother that a few centres of regular \nChandi homam \n&gt; shoul=\r\nd be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done \n3 times a \n&gt;=\r\n day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous \nplaces and=\r\n \n&gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, \nthere =\r\nis no \n&gt; need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare \n=\r\nminimum \n&gt; offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times \nevery=\r\nday. When a \n&gt; few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to=\r\n a \nchain of \n&gt; events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nough not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam \neveryday for=\r\n \n&gt; 3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is \nfantas=\r\ntic! \n&gt; It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and \nb=\r\nrings \n&gt; deities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any =\r\n\ndivine \n&gt; presence these days, new places of divine presence may be create=\r\nd \nby pure \n&gt; souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in =\r\nthe \nworld.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi h=\r\nomam \nduring which \n&gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on s=\r\npreading \nhomam was \n&gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39;s birth anniversary and the tim=\r\ne of sankalpa \nwas within \n&gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha t=\r\nime of the birth \nanniversary. \n&gt; All of this was a coincidence and we were=\r\n unaware of this \nsignificance when \n&gt; we decided the muhurta. It is intere=\r\nsting to know that Ramakrishna \ndid \n&gt; mention fire ceremonies specifically=\r\n to somebody and that his \nwords are \n&gt; similar to the words of Mother.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as h=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now here i=\r\ns the very interesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; &gt; pasted for your =\r\nbenefit), from an interview found here\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/t=\r\naxonomy_menu/54/86\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was =\r\ntelling, &quot;You have to go \nnow for\n&gt; &gt; our country, and all other country, y=\r\nou have to go do fire \nceremonies\n&gt; &gt; and show what is truth, what is digni=\r\nty, and at that time the \nwhole\n&gt; &gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American \ndescent),\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her and all \nthat;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At a time wh=\r\nen journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at \nbest,\n&gt; &gt; he had trave=\r\nled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he \nstudied\n&gt; &gt; with a numbe=\r\nr of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi \nand\n&gt; &gt; the sacred fir=\r\ne ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of \nworship\n&gt; &gt; and meditation=\r\n, while undertaking great austerities in the \nprocess.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The=\r\ny undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire \nceremony\n&gt; &gt; and w=\r\norship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from the\n&gt; &gt; humble tem=\r\nple grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
