It n=\r\not only aggravates vaata heavily, but increases ama (toxic buildup) in the =\r\nsystem. Vaata is one big problem and ama is another, which mess up one&#39;s di=\r\ngestion and kill appetite. Once the digestive fire becomes weak, system goe=\r\ns haywire and all other problems arise. Vaata pacifying food and herbs in a=\r\nddition to a lifestyle that reduces toxic buildup may be helpful. Detoxific=\r\nation and things like panchakarma can be helpful.

Even on=\r\ne with normal psychotic issues may not be well served by the toxic combinat=\r\nions created by modern medicine, which I am afraid does not understand &quot;min=\r\nd&quot; as well as Ayurveda did. IMHO, ayurveda has better tools to treat proble=\r\nms of the mind. While herbs like Jataamaamsi, Shankhapushpi, Aswagandha etc=\r\n can do a good job of addressing the root causes of the instability in the =\r\nnervous system when administered properly, modern drugs only put &quot;band-aids=\r\n&quot; on the symptoms arising from those root causes.

But how i=\r\ns a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Feat=\r\nures of both include similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling t=\r\nhings that others cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hal=\r\nlucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangeme=\r\nnt- we have no diagnostic test. However most doctors are pretty good at det=\r\necting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, ps=\r\neudo-psychoses.... their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different fr=\r\nom the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patien=\r\nt.

Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful=\r\n in the kundalini patient?

See all the saints. You are un=\r\nlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all live=\r\nd lives of misery(when looked at by an external\n observer). However the int=\r\nernal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely th=\r\nat some great ones were completely unaware of their external problems.&gt; &gt;Wh=\r\nen Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I so=\r\nmetimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by th=\r\ne parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender=\r\n is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother s=\r\no it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they have =\r\nto learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother takes tim=\r\ne and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&gt; &gt;That results in =\r\nthe problem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges&quot; of energy may=C2=A0result=C2=A0in menta=\r\nl havoc.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are br=\r\nought up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air element wh=\r\nich is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in these\n people.&gt; &gt;So=\r\nme=C2=A0of the=C2=A0people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may=\r\n feel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and t=\r\nhink that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in th=\r\ne eye of the general public.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In gene=\r\nral, for any doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must =\r\nprecede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niy=\r\nama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleepi=\r\nng habits, sexual matters, travel.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all=C2=A0that mu=\r\nst be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is esse=\r\nntial as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totally calm V=\r\nata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases may b=\r\ne useful.&gt; &gt;Then institute small=C2=A0Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava gr=\r\nahas to be performed by the patient. That should really improve matters, as=\r\n\n Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked =\r\nout over one-two years.&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be=\r\n sufficient.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On Frida=\r\ny, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL&gt; STEP i=\r\nn overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an an=\r\nalogy. One\n wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this&gt; body-=\r\nmind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the pala=\r\nce over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occa=\r\nsionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for=\r\n out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In f=\r\nact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothin=\r\ng in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization with=\r\nout any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasi=\r\nshtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get somethi=\r\nng without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may hav=\r\ne deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enoug=\r\nh effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared=\r\n (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;As you\n do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific&gt; desires. Nat=\r\nure has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints =\r\non what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR&gt; OWN previous acti=\r\nons). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer =\r\nwant it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth =\r\none&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One =\r\nmay not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after=\r\n that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In ano=\r\nther &gt; case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be rebo=\r\nrn &gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy tha=\r\nt &gt; experience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various liv=\r\nes, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, com=\r\ning back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience give=\r\nn by a\n rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from havin=\r\ng it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire d=\r\nestined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0&gt; *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or =\r\npainful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it an=\r\nd it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it fr=\r\nom a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind =\r\ncomplex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are inc=\r\norrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete=\r\n realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind\n =\r\ncomplex, without being scared?&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Kun=\r\ndalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better =\r\nthan&gt; Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is st=\r\nill left in one&#39;s system.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic =\r\nnotion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried =\r\ndeeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one o=\r\nvercomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s b=\r\nody-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a =\r\ngreat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, i=\r\nf one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the wo=\r\nrld, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the wor=\r\nld now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any su=\r\nch notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some\n signs of progress =\r\nand yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened K=\r\nundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s wea=\r\nknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritu=\r\nal problems.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I =\r\nrecommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadha=\r\nna, overcome your&gt; weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again,=\r\n I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/th=\r\nings/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It=\r\n is a negative attachment.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &gt; whether you=\r\nr Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 inte=\r\nrnal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &gt; not. If your ab=\r\nility to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your K=\r\nundalini is fast asleep, you are still making\n progress. When you completel=\r\ny overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &gt; will automatically ascen=\r\nd to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surre=\r\nnder is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business with g=\r\nod. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare f=\r\nact.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, =\r\n&quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; -=\r\n all this is just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask =\r\ngod for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or ex=\r\npectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the q=\r\nualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s wa=\r\ny (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accept=\r\ning it gratefully. True surrender\n is thinking of Lord with fascination and=\r\n pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;If one with=\r\nout true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Ku=\r\nndalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god.=\r\n It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not=\r\n about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to m=\r\nouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Si=\r\nmilarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s&gt; protection! Go=\r\nd&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one sh=\r\nould run away from!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether thro=\r\nugh the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Rea=\r\nlize that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it whi=\r\nle you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything an=\r\nytime. Only detachment\n and a very light mental conditioning (very light de=\r\nsires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True =\r\nSelf. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising=\r\n Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regard=\r\ns,&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://w=\r\nww.vedicastrologer.org/&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;_____________=\r\n___________________&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursda=\r\ny, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini synd=\r\nrome&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly corre=\r\nct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the i=\r\nshtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and\n manth=\r\nra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc =\r\nwith the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a m=\r\nahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped=\r\n off .

In simpler words this translates into more detach=\r\nment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed=\r\n etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening\n happens, one has t=\r\no now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far m=\r\nore intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A =\r\ngood guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does -=\r\n it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities=\r\n, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, a=\r\nnd given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. The=\r\ny take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes=\r\n the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more&gt; vital. 4 - While =\r\nsomeday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti =\r\nawekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this=\r\n. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffici=\r\nent to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aur=\r\na of an individual, which protects us from\n various subtle influences and h=\r\nelps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various=\r\n reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can a=\r\nllow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances =\r\nof causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various poss=\r\niblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover,=\r\n even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right kn=\r\nowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often =\r\ndoing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.&gt; Sometimes it will have =\r\nresults, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is=\r\n a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens san=\r\na in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyakti=\r\nmApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam |=\r\n|[7:24]&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From:\n sunrise_1080 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Jus=\r\nt wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience=\r\n of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have bee=\r\nn involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontane=\r\nous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-=\r\nbody experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian ori=\r\ngin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she sea=\r\nrched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically=\r\n wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to dera=\r\nnged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as hav=\r\ning a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this h=\r\nas triggered interest and\n research into this topic in mainstream psychiatr=\r\ny. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine=\r\n, and as we have no treatments for deranged&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help=\r\n them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with t=\r\nhis lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened=\r\n. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the =\r\nderanged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is somethi=\r\nng she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her p=\r\nroblem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as =\r\nthe kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, =\r\nor give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samarita=\r\nns among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of=\r\n)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana=\r\n so as not to end\n up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the =\r\nbhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your ins=\r\ntrument&quot; and leave the kundalini&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.

Once the digestiv=\r\ne fire becomes weak, system goes haywire and all other problems arise. Vaat=\r\na pacifying food and herbs in addition to a lifestyle that reduces toxic bu=\r\nildup may be helpful. Detoxification and things like panchakarma can be hel=\r\npful.

But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psyc=\r\nhosis? Features of both include similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing=\r\n/smelling things that others cannot experience- in other words, what doctor=\r\ns call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or the result of kundalin=\r\ni derangement- we have no diagnostic test. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;However most doctors a=\r\nre pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseu=\r\ndo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend to be pretty sho=\r\nddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my head&quot; schizophreni=\r\nc or kundalini patient. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;About vata, most of our patients have sev=\r\nere problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable to sleep, uma=\r\nble to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try and help wi=\r\nth this with medication and lifestyle advice.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you. =\r\nin actual fact, that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited yo=\r\nu&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;However,&nbsp;the hold o=\r\nf the I ness on everything is so tremendous that its difficult to let go en=\r\nough that you can allow this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors who see thes=\r\ne &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because they are conditioned to th=\r\nink in words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God completely =\r\nanyway.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; This,&nbsp;combined with the fact that for&nbsp;most peopl=\r\ne, Kundalini is\n not wanted because these people&nbsp;want the objects whic=\r\nh God can give, not God Herself, means that the scope for misunderstanding =\r\nis tremendous.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but most are unable t=\r\no realise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unli=\r\nkely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived =\r\nlives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). However the intern=\r\nal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely that =\r\nsome great ones were completely unaware of their external problems.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sl=\r\neep.I sometimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the a=\r\nir by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s s=\r\nurrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the =\r\nmother so\n it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem with adult=\r\ns is that they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Div=\r\nine Mother takes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby=\r\n.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energ=\r\ny may&nbsp;result&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up wi=\r\nth the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air element which is unst=\r\nable anyway can cause serious instability in these people.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Som=\r\ne&nbsp;of the&nbsp;people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may =\r\nfeel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and th=\r\nink that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the=\r\n eye of the general public.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific probl=\r\nem:In general, for any doctor, the separation of the true from the false\n c=\r\nlaims must precede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini ris=\r\ne needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food hab=\r\nits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish =\r\nVata, all&nbsp;that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Co=\r\nntrol of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the =\r\nbody to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in diff=\r\nicult real cases may be useful.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homa=\r\ns to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That =\r\nshould really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two years.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;On F=\r\nriday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; STEP in ove=\r\nrcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from\n one&#39;s small dilapid=\r\nated house (this&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Sel=\r\nf) may first construct the palace over time and move into it when it is COM=\r\nPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still =\r\nunder construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini ri=\r\nse), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approac=\r\nh is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards=\r\n complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are n=\r\not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanti=\r\nng it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired=\r\n a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a r=\r\nesult, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically=\r\n may not even want it!) when it comes in this\n life.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;&gt; desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (beca=\r\nuse of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you wan=\r\nt LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one=\r\n may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very =\r\nsick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life fo=\r\nr health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any=\r\n knowledge or money. In another &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; case, one may deeply desire to ac=\r\nt in a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act=\r\n in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; experience. Basicall=\r\ny, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; som=\r\nething they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway=\r\n, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience=\r\n given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from h=\r\naving it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desi=\r\nre destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;WBR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful=\r\n, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I=\r\n went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I=\r\n went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would k=\r\nill it!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk,=\r\n glued to the mouse trap\n called this body-mind complex and scared of being=\r\n rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are in=\r\ncorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complet=\r\ne realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind =\r\ncomplex, without being scared?&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after m=\r\nost undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; Kunda=\r\nlini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in=\r\n one&#39;s system.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends=\r\n one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion=\r\n that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torm=\r\nent one. If one\n overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another=\r\n notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. =\r\na great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an =\r\nextreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul =\r\nwho rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who w=\r\nill rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deepl=\r\ny clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some s=\r\nigns of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with unde=\r\nsirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heav=\r\nily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;The\n best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini a=\r\nnd its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; weaknesses and improve=\r\n your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is n=\r\not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the ot=\r\nher side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; wh=\r\nether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resi=\r\nst 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &lt;WBR&gt;&gt=\r\n; not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progres=\r\ns. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. Wh=\r\nen you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; =\r\nwill automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;WBR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true s=\r\nurrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business wi=\r\nth god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and ba=\r\nre fact.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to=\r\n you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray=\r\n to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is=\r\n something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for=\r\n agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing onesel=\r\nf in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepti=\r\nng anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly pain=\r\nful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinki=\r\nng of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and\n during)=\r\n Death.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surren=\r\nder and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, o=\r\nne may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that=\r\n god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecti=\r\nng or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; exam=\r\nple above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s =\r\nconditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; protection! God&#39;s pro=\r\ntection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should ru=\r\nn away from!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or su=\r\nrrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is tempor=\r\nary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have\n and keep doing =\r\nyour best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and =\r\na very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can pro=\r\ntect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and=\r\n impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) =\r\nand stop Her from meeting True Self.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nWBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n--------&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;________________________________&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sast=\r\nry &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&quot; &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:ve=\r\ndic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;WBR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;b=\r\nut intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by=\r\n the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called =\r\ndhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entiti=\r\nes to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&n=\r\nbsp; Once we are under the protection\n of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the othe=\r\nr&nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various =\r\nelements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this =\r\ntranslates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, co=\r\nntrol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini aw=\r\nakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater =\r\nforce. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes c=\r\nare of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF=\r\n and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various=\r\n other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while s=\r\nome of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the indivi=\r\ndual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character an=\r\nd nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes ev=\r\nen more&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; vital. 4 - While\n someday or other every sadhaka will have=\r\n an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladie=\r\ns of psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by =\r\nwest today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is a=\r\nlso possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us fr=\r\nom various subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities,=\r\n can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional =\r\nlifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities insi=\r\nde the mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these=\r\n are very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to=\r\n list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly do=\r\nne, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many wh=\r\no claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent gu=\r\ness work.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all =\r\nthese to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, a=\r\ns the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards &nbs=\r\np;Rajarshi &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamaj=\r\nAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday=\r\n, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Kundalini syndrome&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbs=\r\np; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundal=\r\nini syndrome based\n on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doin=\r\ng a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someon=\r\ne who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini=\r\n since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of e=\r\nnergy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kunda=\r\nlini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We hav=\r\ne not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests norma=\r\nl)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we c=\r\nall mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwan=\r\nted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and resear=\r\nch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients a=\r\nre not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments fo=\r\nr deranged&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to =\r\nforcibly\n waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my fe=\r\neling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to ki=\r\nll herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so ba=\r\nd. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape fro=\r\nm. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one =\r\nwas to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve=\r\n the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength=\r\n to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for he=\r\nr, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering reall=\r\ny is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in =\r\nthis situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safes=\r\nt. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the ku=\r\nndalini&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.
