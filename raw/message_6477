As \nKali deepens, rishis have put locks on all procedures and mantras tha=\r\nt \ncan be misused. The knowledge has been intentionally corrupted.\n\nHowever=\r\n, when a person with enough tapassakti really desires, even an \nincorrect m=\r\nantra or a corrupt procedure can produce the desired result. \nOf course, th=\r\ne person will end up wasting tapassakti and/or accumulating \nundesirable ka=\r\nrmas, but that is a different matter.\n\nMost people who do sadhana today do =\r\nnot accumulate any shakti. Out of \nthe very few who accumulate shakti, a ve=\r\nry very very small portion \nretain it and grow it for an extended period, d=\r\no not get tempted by it, \ndo not use it for egoistic/selfish reasons and pu=\r\nt it to use for the \nincrease of universal dhaarma and progress further tow=\r\nards \nSelf-realization. Others who accumulate shakti put it to use for \nego=\r\nistic reasons, for themselves or somebody close to them or somebody \nwho pa=\r\nys them (or praises them), etc. Such people never become realized \nand get =\r\nstuck, but they do have the ability to produce small results due \nto the sh=\r\nakti accumulated through sadhana and austerities.\n\nIf you have not seen suc=\r\nh people, it does not mean they do not exist!\n\nOf course, it is not a great=\r\n idea to seek out such people, for all they \ncan do is to generate small re=\r\nsults that are temporary in nature. They \ncannot make you a better person o=\r\nr take you to god.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSecondly, fire is a totally differ=\r\nent ballgame compared to any other \nsadhana. Our scriptures say &quot;agnimukhaa=\r\n vai devaah (gods are accessible \nthrough fire)&quot; and such tradition existed=\r\n in so many religions and \ncultures. All this is not without reason.\n\nFire =\r\npurifies and fire is the greatest teacher. Merely spending time in \nfront o=\r\nf an external fire will increase the internal fire through \nresonance and p=\r\nurify one&#39;s thinking.\n\nEven if one does not do homam, merely spending 20 mi=\r\nnutes every day =E2=80=93 or \nan hour or two every week =E2=80=93 meditatin=\r\ng in front of a reasonable size \nfire with a sense of sacredness and revere=\r\nnce, can make a lot of \ndifference to one=E2=80=99s state of mind and make =\r\nit more focused, calm and \npeaceful over time. The proof of the pudding is =\r\nin eating it. One can \ntry it and see for oneself what it can do.\n\nI will n=\r\not guarantee material results (though several people in serious \ntroubles s=\r\nolved them by doing homam for a few months), but I can vouch \nthat one&#39;s me=\r\nntal condition will change through regular fire ritual.\n\nBest regards,\nNara=\r\nsimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n =\r\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  =\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n =\r\n                     Twitter ID: @homam108\n--------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\njyotishi&quot; &lt;raj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; IMHO, in this kaliyuga, just as sacred homa =\r\nand tapa give none or \n&gt; delayed or limited results, vashikaran etc too do =\r\nnot work.
