Liked your mail.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nFirstly, I am neither Manish nor Narasimha, but just another regular guy in=\r\n this forum. So whatever I type is from a rational understanding of the pro=\r\ncess and nothing more. It will not be worth much. Still, I felt like sendin=\r\ng some comments.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0The best part of your mail=C2=A0- IMHO - is t=\r\nhe consequent=C2=A0&quot;stillness within my existence&quot; that you described.=C2=\r\n=A0The effect a smashan=C2=A0bhoomi has on the human mind=C2=A0can be very =\r\nstrong and=C2=A0meditative.Most people would feel a little withdrawn after =\r\na visit to a samshan.=C2=A0In this world of duality, every place, person, o=\r\nbject has a different energy. The energy of a smashan is quite &quot;unique&quot;=C2=\r\n=A0 - for lack of better words - and it can help to focus the mind. Moreove=\r\nr it was your father&#39;s pyre, so that may have also worked subconsciously in=\r\n your mind to clam it down further.\n=C2=A0\nVisualizations are a good tool t=\r\nhat many people use in sadhana, but (in my opinion) nothing is more importa=\r\nnt or a better parameter of sadhana than the degree of focus and calmness=\r\n=C2=A0your mind achieves. Even when you do a homa at home, the best part of=\r\n the homa is the meditation when the purnahuti burns. So therefore, do not=\r\n=C2=A0keep your focus too much on visions or images your mind draws up. The=\r\ny are mostly a product of our conditioned mind. You may not always be able =\r\nto know the real cause of why your mind shows you something. For a vision t=\r\no be a value and accuracy, one must have a very egoless personality. The I-=\r\nness has to considerably reduced. Most of us do not have such a state yet, =\r\nand therefore our internal=C2=A0nadis are not cleared enough. Hence, genera=\r\nlly speaking, don&#39;t trust images of the mind since=C2=A0these can be at tim=\r\nes self-deluding in nature. Focus on calming the mind, and maintaing the ca=\r\nlmness for as long as you can. That, I feel, is the\n essence of sadhana for=\r\n starters like me. What you thought you saw when you did Reiki to your fath=\r\ner&#39;s soul, maybe a product of your subconscious mind. \n=C2=A0\nThe fact that=\r\n you prayed to Ma Durga for punya of your father&#39;s soul is itself a boon. W=\r\nhether he actually got any merit out of your ahutis and what degree of meri=\r\nt etc is mere speculations of the mind. A sincere=C2=A0prayer from a genuin=\r\ne heart, at least, will never cause bad merit to teh departed soul. =C2=A0B=\r\ne sure of that much. \n=C2=A0\nWhen a homa is done in a pyre, it is like a fu=\r\nll normal homa with proper invocations, mudras, a certain number of ahutis =\r\nand purnahuti. It is almost=C2=A0like=C2=A0a homa anywhere else, except tha=\r\nt you are using the fire of a pyre. For ordinary people like me, the streng=\r\nth and effectiveness=C2=A0of a homa depends on=C2=A0the number of times it =\r\nis done and the more the number of ahutis. That is,=C2=A0one good full homa=\r\n at home should be ideally 108 ahutis or more, or in case of Chandi, the 70=\r\n0 verses. The basic idea is, how long are you interacting with the fire. Th=\r\ne more you do, the better for you. Lesser ahutis for ordinary people like m=\r\ne, may not produce any great effect. \n=C2=A0\nSit at a distance that is comf=\r\nortable for you considering the heat. Regarding the rooster, it could be a =\r\ndeity or it could be simply a coincidence. Consider this example which=C2=\r\n=A0 I tell myself often. There is a HUGE/GIGANTIC cake with some nice icing=\r\n on top. And there is a very tiny rat which is eating the cake. The cake is=\r\n sadhana. The icing on top is the deity appearing in some form or the other=\r\n. The rat is me. Since the cake is really huge, I have to start eating from=\r\n the bottom. I cannot reach=C2=A0the icing at the beginning however much I =\r\nmay want to. Once I have eaten up the cake sufficiently, the icing at the t=\r\nop comes down and I can taste it then. Similarly, the idea is repeated effo=\r\nrts, constant nibbling of the cake from the bottom. The deity may come to y=\r\nou or He/She maynot, but the million dollar question is how are you going t=\r\no know for sure? You cannot, unless your I-ness has been sufficiently purif=\r\nied. Till then your mind will keep mixing\n imagination from within yourself=\r\n with reality from outside yourself. And you will be left with speculation =\r\nand more speculation. The dogs came there in Kasi because Manish was doing =\r\nthe homa. When he did a homa in Kurukshetra there too a similar thing happe=\r\nned (Narasimha mentioned this). From Manish&#39;s perspective, he has already t=\r\nasted the icing. So he can know=C2=A0for sure. From my perspective, I am ni=\r\nbbling at the bottom of the cake. I can never know for sure. If Manish had =\r\nnot told me that Kala Bhairava was inside the dog, I would have put it down=\r\n to a strange/curious kind of dog. Nothing more. In such a case, one can ad=\r\nopt two different attitudes.=C2=A0 You can either=C2=A0disregard all such f=\r\nringe events, put on blinkers=C2=A0and keep ploughing at your sadhana until=\r\nl finally you hit the jackpot with such force that you know for sure this i=\r\ns the real stuff, or, you simply regard everything=C2=A0(animals/humans/inc=\r\nidents) around as a play of the=C2=A0Deity and respectfully\n do whatever yo=\r\nu can. For example, if you are doing a homa and some of the samagri is left=\r\n un-used, and there is some animal nearby, just feed the animal if it is wi=\r\nlling etc etc. Chose or mix and=C2=A0match which every policy suits you bes=\r\nt. But keep doing sadhana. THAT is vital. Like in=C2=A0sadhana at home a sa=\r\nmshan sadhana too takes practise and effort. So do not worry about all thes=\r\ne too much and just intensify whatever=C2=A0sadhana you can do on a regular=\r\n basis. Intensity is what makes an Aghori (my opinion).\n=C2=A0\nIf you find =\r\nan attraction for this kind of a path, I would suggest that you start doing=\r\n Chandi homas at home regularly for some months.=C2=A0 Along with it, keep =\r\na pair of your clothes which only you will use and no one else. Then, after=\r\n you have completed a certain number of Chandi homas, wear that specific cl=\r\nothes, go to a smashan from time to time and do the Chandi path and meditat=\r\ne. Leave the rest on Her.=C2=A0She knows best. \n=C2=A0\nMake sure that the c=\r\nlothes are yours and no one else wears those in case you are planning to ac=\r\nt on this suggestion.\n=C2=A0\nThe reason why=C2=A0I suggest=C2=A0Chandi (ful=\r\nl Durga Saptashati)=C2=A0specifically=C2=A0is because there is an inherent/=\r\ninbuilt protection in Chandi Path. Which means even if your invocation of t=\r\nhe deity is imperfect, merely reading the Chandi itself=C2=A0will bring Her=\r\n=C2=A0grace down on you. With other mantras, there maybe many auxilliary pr=\r\nocedures needed=C2=A0for a sadhana=C2=A0in a smashan.=C2=A0A Smashan is no=\r\n=C2=A0doubt=C2=A0an interesting place, but=C2=A0there are many different el=\r\nements present there as well. With ChandiPath, this aspect gets taken care.=\r\n \n=C2=A0\nI merely said what I could logically think of. I may or may not be=\r\n correct. I hope you take this mail in the right vein. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\nRama Naama Satya Hai..\n\n--- On Wed, 3/2/10, sharadsap &lt;=\r\nsharadsap@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: sharadsap &lt;sharadsap@...&gt;\nSub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Experience at a Smashaan Bhumi\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\nDate: Wednesday, 3 February, 2010, 4:49 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nDear Memb=\r\ners,\nAfter a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to share an =\r\nexperience with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so would elic=\r\nit some feedback in the form of further guidance. \n\nI am a student of Vipas=\r\nsana and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started =\r\na simple version of Durga Homam) &#39;almost&#39; regularly for a year now. And I h=\r\nave been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. \n\nOn t=\r\nhe 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling with ren=\r\nal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were =\r\ntaking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was=\r\n constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) wri=\r\ntten by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a fun=\r\neral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would get =\r\nto see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful i=\r\nt would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that he =\r\nwould also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I had=\r\n an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly remi=\r\nnded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a feat.=\r\n As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing in=\r\ntensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially\n in/around the abdo=\r\nminal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equanim=\r\nously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon after=\r\n, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, and m=\r\nay be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery.=\r\n But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, =\r\nif he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think o=\r\nf it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away sa=\r\nying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things a=\r\nnd in addition he bought some ghee. \n\nIt was my first time at a smashaan bh=\r\numi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body at such c=\r\nlose quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after th=\r\ne fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I compo=\r\nsed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the friends/relativ=\r\nes were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my=\r\n cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I would like to=\r\n meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had =\r\nalready observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Ra=\r\njarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was =\r\nexpecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). \n\nI closed=\r\n my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and =\r\nthe Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very first attempt=\r\n in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussin=\r\ng on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching=\r\n my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the=\r\n warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention o=\r\nf gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to=\r\n be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; =\r\nso that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspecte=\r\nd further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind abo=\r\nut attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I =\r\nmentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a tru=\r\ne seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done\n homam in the past,=\r\n I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and still beli=\r\neve that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past=\r\n karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well=\r\n, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this=\r\n mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is=\r\n peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my i=\r\nmpurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son=\r\n of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n\nAfter this mental dialogue, I =\r\nthough of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about M=\r\naa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am=\r\n a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are f=\r\norms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which=\r\n Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and inst=\r\nead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my ment=\r\nal imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with =\r\nthe colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was =\r\ndifferent, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that col=\r\nour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT tryin=\r\ng to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has =\r\narrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thought=\r\ns about the desire and surrendering of\n my ignorance. I sought permission f=\r\nrom the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also rememb=\r\ner clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and =\r\nto NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetel=\r\ny NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n\nI had a small mental dialogue w=\r\nith my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, and I se=\r\neked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n\nAnd then I started my man=\r\ntra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering somet=\r\nhing in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place=\r\n - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a whil=\r\ne, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Throug=\r\nh out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my d=\r\nad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternative=\r\nly, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi =\r\nremoved a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the d=\r\nirection which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, =\r\nI became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and was sit=\r\nting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was no=\r\nt disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be a=\r\nble to invite the deity, but nevertheless I\n continued. Few minutes later, =\r\nI heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining =\r\nblack hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood=\r\n/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (eit=\r\nher a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boun=\r\ndary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and mov=\r\ning around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the f=\r\nuneral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange =\r\nbecause it was amused with the fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) =\r\nfalling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the ceme=\r\nnt roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughe=\r\nd at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I=\r\n said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin =\r\nand he said 30 more minutes. So I\n continued the mental chanting. \n\nAnd the=\r\nn my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to leave. I waited f=\r\nor everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds=\r\n, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walked towards the fun=\r\neral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and asked her to accept =\r\nmy offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was sooooo hot that I =\r\ncould not stand closer and started wondering how far did Manish and Rajarsh=\r\ni sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted m=\r\ny name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them, and even though=\r\n it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was happening, I was a=\r\n little scared because I did not want anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; te=\r\nndencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of the packets in bo=\r\nth my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence and requested he=\r\nr to accept this final offering and threw it at the funeral\n pyre from a di=\r\nstance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simply do the needful=\r\n and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ =\r\nPVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. \n\nWhen I was washing my hands=\r\n and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red ting=\r\ne to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesame=\r\n seeds or jaggery??). \n\nOn the way back home and for the entire evening, I =\r\nfelt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of ach=\r\nievement, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I=\r\n had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian =\r\nstillness within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as =\r\nI could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualis=\r\nations could have been a product of my own imagination - but the silence wa=\r\ns real. And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing. \n\nThe =\r\nnext day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires=\r\n, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if =\r\nmy brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.\n\nNow th=\r\nat it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen t=\r\noo, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? I=\r\ns there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perfo=\r\nrm hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;punya=\r\n&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as=\r\n opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day =\r\nwhen I was channeling some reiki to him? \n\nI am not sure if these questions=\r\n can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the abo=\r\nve experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I woul=\r\nd be most appreciative.\n\nThank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continue=\r\nd inspiration. \n\nAlso, apologies for the length of the note.\n\nRegards\nShara=\r\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Your Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8.

Moreover it was your father&#39;s pyre, so that may have also w=\r\norked subconsciously in your mind to clam it down further.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Visualizations are a good tool that many people use in sadhana=\r\n, but (in my opinion) nothing is more important or a better parameter of sa=\r\ndhana than the degree of focus and calmness&nbsp;your mind achieves. Even w=\r\nhen you do a homa at home, the best part of the homa is the meditation when=\r\n the purnahuti burns. So therefore, do not&nbsp;keep your focus too much on=\r\n visions or images your mind draws up. They are mostly a product of our con=\r\nditioned mind. You may not always be able to know the real cause of why you=\r\nr mind shows you something. For a vision to be a value and accuracy, one mu=\r\nst have a very egoless personality. The I-ness has to considerably reduced.=\r\n Most of us do not have such a state yet, and therefore our internal&nbsp;n=\r\nadis are not cleared enough. Hence, generally speaking, don&#39;t trust images =\r\nof the mind since&nbsp;these can be at times self-deluding in nature. Focus=\r\n on calming the mind, and maintaing the calmness for as long as you can.\n T=\r\nhat, I feel, is the essence of sadhana for starters like me. What you thoug=\r\nht you saw when you did Reiki to your father&#39;s soul, maybe a product of you=\r\nr subconscious mind. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The fact that you prayed=\r\n to Ma Durga for punya of your father&#39;s soul is itself a boon. Whether he a=\r\nctually got any merit out of your ahutis and what degree of merit etc is me=\r\nre speculations of the mind. A sincere&nbsp;prayer from a genuine heart, at=\r\n least, will never cause bad merit to teh departed soul. &nbsp;Be sure of t=\r\nhat much. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;When a homa is done in a pyre, it i=\r\ns like a full normal homa with proper invocations, mudras, a certain number=\r\n of ahutis and purnahuti. It is almost&nbsp;like&nbsp;a homa anywhere else,=\r\n except that you are using the fire of a pyre. For ordinary people like me,=\r\n the strength and effectiveness&nbsp;of a homa depends on&nbsp;the number o=\r\nf times it is done and the more the number of ahutis. That is,&nbsp;one goo=\r\nd full homa at home should be ideally 108 ahutis or more, or in case of Cha=\r\nndi, the 700 verses. The basic idea is, how long are you interacting with t=\r\nhe fire. The more you do, the better for you. Lesser ahutis for ordinary pe=\r\nople like me, may not produce any great effect. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Sit at a distance that is comfortable for you considering the heat. Rega=\r\nrding the rooster, it could be a deity or it could be simply a coincidence.=\r\n Consider this example which&nbsp; I tell myself often. There is a HUGE/GIG=\r\nANTIC cake with some nice icing on top. And there is a very tiny rat which =\r\nis eating the cake. The cake is sadhana. The icing on top is the deity appe=\r\naring in some form or the other. The rat is me. Since the cake is really hu=\r\nge, I have to start eating from the bottom. I cannot reach&nbsp;the icing a=\r\nt the beginning however much I may want to. Once I have eaten up the cake s=\r\nufficiently, the icing at the top comes down and I can taste it then. Simil=\r\narly, the idea is repeated efforts, constant nibbling of the cake from the =\r\nbottom. The deity may come to you or He/She maynot, but the million dollar =\r\nquestion is how are you going to know for sure? You cannot, unless your I-n=\r\ness has been sufficiently purified. Till then your mind will keep\n mixing i=\r\nmagination from within yourself with reality from outside yourself. And you=\r\n will be left with speculation and more speculation. The dogs came there in=\r\n Kasi because Manish was doing the homa. When he did a homa in Kurukshetra =\r\nthere too a similar thing happened (Narasimha mentioned this). From Manish&#39;=\r\ns perspective, he has already tasted the icing. So he can know&nbsp;for sur=\r\ne. From my perspective, I am nibbling at the bottom of the cake. I can neve=\r\nr know for sure. If Manish had not told me that Kala Bhairava was inside th=\r\ne dog, I would have put it down to a strange/curious kind of dog. Nothing m=\r\nore. In such a case, one can adopt two different attitudes.&nbsp; You can e=\r\nither&nbsp;disregard all such fringe events, put on blinkers&nbsp;and keep =\r\nploughing at your sadhana untill finally you hit the jackpot with such forc=\r\ne that you know for sure this is the real stuff, or, you simply regard ever=\r\nything&nbsp;(animals/humans/incidents) around as a play of\n the&nbsp;Deity =\r\nand respectfully do whatever you can. For example, if you are doing a homa =\r\nand some of the samagri is left un-used, and there is some animal nearby, j=\r\nust feed the animal if it is willing etc etc. Chose or mix and&nbsp;match w=\r\nhich every policy suits you best. But keep doing sadhana. THAT is vital. Li=\r\nke in&nbsp;sadhana at home a samshan sadhana too takes practise and effort.=\r\n So do not worry about all these too much and just intensify whatever&nbsp;=\r\nsadhana you can do on a regular basis. Intensity is what makes an Aghori (m=\r\ny opinion).&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If you find an attraction for this=\r\n kind of a path, I would suggest that you start doing Chandi homas at home =\r\nregularly for some months.&nbsp; Along with it, keep a pair of your clothes=\r\n which only you will use and no one else. Then, after you have completed a =\r\ncertain number of Chandi homas, wear that specific clothes, go to a smashan=\r\n from time to time and do the Chandi path and meditate. Leave the rest on H=\r\ner.&nbsp;She knows best. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Make sure that the c=\r\nlothes are yours and no one else wears those in case you are planning to ac=\r\nt on this suggestion.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The reason why&nbsp;I su=\r\nggest&nbsp;Chandi (full Durga Saptashati)&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;is because=\r\n there is an inherent/inbuilt protection in Chandi Path. Which means even i=\r\nf your invocation of the deity is imperfect, merely reading the Chandi itse=\r\nlf&nbsp;will bring Her&nbsp;grace down on you. With other mantras, there ma=\r\nybe many auxilliary procedures needed&nbsp;for a sadhana&nbsp;in a smashan.=\r\n&nbsp;A Smashan is no&nbsp;doubt&nbsp;an interesting place, but&nbsp;there =\r\nare many different elements present there as well. With ChandiPath, this as=\r\npect gets taken care. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I merely said what I co=\r\nuld logically think of. I may or may not be correct. I hope you take this m=\r\nail in the right vein. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNorm=\r\nal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdan=\r\na&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;Rama=\r\n Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, 3/2/10, sharadsap &lt;I&gt;&lt;sharadsap@...&gt;&lt;/I=\r\n&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; =\r\nBORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: sharadsap &lt;sharadsap@ya=\r\nhoo.co.uk&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Experience at a Smashaan Bhumi&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, 3 February, 2010, 4:49=\r\n PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv726741539&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SP=\r\nAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Members,&lt;BR&gt;After a lot of deliberation=\r\n, I decided to write this note to share an experience with the members on t=\r\nhis forum - hoping that doing so would elicit some feedback in the form of =\r\nfurther guidance. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am a student of Vipassana and have been doing h=\r\nomam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a simple version of Durga =\r\nHomam) &#39;almost&#39; regularly for a year now. And I have been reading the posts=\r\n on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the 28th of Jan, my f=\r\nather passed away peacefully (after struggling with renal failure and other=\r\n complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father&#39;s b=\r\nody to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded=\r\n of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (de=\r\ntailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi w=\r\nith Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris =\r\nin the smashaan\n bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an A=\r\nghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that he would also attain s=\r\nome punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire =\r\nto perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I =\r\nmust be kidding to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended th=\r\ne steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sens=\r\nations all over my body...especially in/around the abdominal region. As tau=\r\nght in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equanimously as I could, an=\r\nd told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to =\r\nmy mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I should perfo=\r\nrm a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted =\r\nto have a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure =\r\nsome black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend wa=\r\ns not\n even baffled at my request) - and he went away saying he would try a=\r\nnd returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he b=\r\nought some ghee. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also=\r\n the very first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters=\r\n. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ig=\r\nnited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, w=\r\nent in the direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were stand=\r\ning and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and m=\r\ny nephew to sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, an=\r\nd requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already obser=\r\nved a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s note=\r\ns) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the=\r\n dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I closed my\n ey=\r\nes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Ri=\r\nshis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very first attempt in do=\r\ning such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on b=\r\nreath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my br=\r\neath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warni=\r\nng that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gain=\r\ning spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be di=\r\nfferent. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so tha=\r\nt his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected furt=\r\nher and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about att=\r\nempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mental=\r\nly surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seek=\r\ner, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done homam in the\n past, I hav=\r\ne asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe th=\r\nat it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karma=\r\ns, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I as=\r\nk you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this munda=\r\nne desire that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peace=\r\nful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurit=\r\nies and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yo=\r\nurs if he is doing something wrong&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After this mental dialogue, I =\r\nthough of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about M=\r\naa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am=\r\n a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are f=\r\norms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which=\r\n Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise\n Maa Durga and ins=\r\ntead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my men=\r\ntal imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with=\r\n the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was=\r\n different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that co=\r\nlour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT tryi=\r\nng to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has=\r\n arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the though=\r\nts about the desire and surrendering of my ignorance. I sought permission f=\r\nrom the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also rememb=\r\ner clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and =\r\nto NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetel=\r\ny NOT punish me in any way for doing this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I had a small mental dial=\r\nogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about\n what I was going to do, a=\r\nnd I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And then I s=\r\ntarted my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was o=\r\nffering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings=\r\n taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mant=\r\nra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at th=\r\ne end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi sta=\r\nnding on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her fee=\r\nt alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I f=\r\nelt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little dist=\r\nance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten mi=\r\nnutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had com=\r\ne and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the =\r\ndog. I was not disappointed, but I told\n myself, it was silly of me to thin=\r\nk I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I continued. Few mi=\r\nnutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to s=\r\nee a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but br=\r\night red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smasha=\r\nan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending fr=\r\nom a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started ju=\r\nmping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump=\r\n inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was ac=\r\nting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked li=\r\nke &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hit=\r\nting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few mi=\r\nnutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but n=\r\nevertheless I said I would\n continue until it is time for us to leave. I as=\r\nked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I continued the mental chanti=\r\nng. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone t=\r\no leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the=\r\n black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and wal=\r\nked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and a=\r\nsked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was=\r\n sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did=\r\n Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin=\r\n of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join th=\r\nem, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was=\r\n happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know tha=\r\nt I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents o=\r\nf the packets in\n both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impude=\r\nnce and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the fun=\r\neral pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to si=\r\nmply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group an=\r\nd Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wh=\r\nen I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and=\r\n now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could b=\r\ne because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the way back home=\r\n and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt=\r\n say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happen=\r\ned was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking a=\r\nbout &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. =\r\nI watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a =\r\nsense of\n &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my own =\r\nimagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was =\r\nthe most beautiful thing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The next day, I heard my brother tell my =\r\nuncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too bi=\r\ng and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of &#39;perce=\r\nption&#39; or love for our father.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now that it is few days since that in=\r\ncident, I have questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? W=\r\nhy was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between th=\r\ne hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa =\r\ntemples? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then wh=\r\ny did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two fee=\r\nt) a half-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some reik=\r\ni to him? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not sure if these questions can be answered or if th=\r\ney\n should be answered at all, but based on the above experience, if anyone=\r\n has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, apologies for the length of the note.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Sharad&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1-=\r\n-&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
