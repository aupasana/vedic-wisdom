Just for the =\r\nsake&lt;BR&gt;of filling my stomach or satisfying cravings of my tongue, I won=C2=\r\n=A1=C2=A6t be&lt;BR&gt;responsible for killing innocent birds, animals, fishes di=\r\nrectly or&lt;BR&gt;indirectly. What right I have, to snatch away even a single li=\r\nfe in&lt;BR&gt;the universe for my selfish reasons. I consider that as very very&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;cruel and that is the personal thinking why I am a vegetarian and not&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;strictly due to any religious or cultural reason=C2=A1=C2=A8&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;]=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Even if Shri Krishna has not mentioned a direct wording of Non-=\r\nvegetarian food in Geeta, it is not right to take that excuse for slotterin=\r\ng creatures.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I ask any body to think for him/her self in the lig=\r\nht of what is right and what is not...&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nUtpal&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Astro Seeker &=\r\nlt;astro.seeker@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am a firm believer of V=\r\neg being satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle to spiritual growth. Bu=\r\nt, a friend of mine who otherwise is trying to make some spiritual progress=\r\n, is a non-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-veg food, he has put a cou=\r\nnter argument. He says that if I can find him a single shloka on this in Bh=\r\nagwat Geeta, he would give up.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; So, if anybody on this group c=\r\nan help me find the quote, it would be great. He considers Geeta as the abs=\r\nolute reference and believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken about it in Gee=\r\nta, it is actually not worth discussing whether or not you take non-veg. If=\r\n anyone finds it, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can become\n vegeta=\r\nrian.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He also quotes Sai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adhering =\r\nto non-veg. If any of you know the counter argument, please help.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; B=\r\nest Regards,Sriram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The INTERNET now has a persona=\r\nlity. YOURS!
