Some times=\r\n I have to attend emergencies in early morning. \n\nI used to perform Homam d=\r\nuring winters regularly in early morning. but after summers started we usua=\r\nlly get high incidence of Emergencies in early morning due to harvesting se=\r\nason, then paddy sowing season and now a days it is time to pour insecticid=\r\nes and pesticides in fields.\n\nDue to all these reasons I had to quit my rou=\r\ntine of doing homam in early morning. And sometimes it also cause disturban=\r\nce in my Japam schedule. \n\nI seriously want to resume my routine of Homam. =\r\nAnd as Shri Krishna Homam is done in morning I am hesitant to do it in even=\r\ning with a fear of doing a wrong deed. \n In winters I will be able to do th=\r\ne homam in early morning as Emergency turnout it very less at that time. \n\n=\r\nBut Till then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your book =\r\n&quot;Vedic Wisdom&quot; Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I switch =\r\nto Ganapati homam to be performed at night?\n\nPersonally, I want to stick to=\r\n Shri Krishna homam as I feel myself attached to Him. But Doing Maha Ganapa=\r\nti Homam will also have same importance for me.\n\nHope to find a suitable an=\r\nswer\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n\n"}}
