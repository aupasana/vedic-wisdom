And a shapoddhara stotra i=\r\ns also prescribed to enable the chanter relieve the curse and realize the b=\r\nenefits of chanting. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether you believe in the Shaapa or not, it has=\r\n helped me, whenever I mentally prayed to the Rishis Brahma, Vasishta, Vish=\r\nwamitra and Sukracharya before I started chanting the Gayatri.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wi=\r\nshes\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt;   Re: Aghora books - Questions\n&gt; Posted by: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; pvk=\r\nlnrao@...   pvklnrao\n&gt; Wed Mar 10, 2010 5:30 am (PST)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In one of the=\r\n books Vimalananda gives out why the real Gayathri is hidden. The actually =\r\nGayathri generate immense heat which our body can not bear. Hence, one shou=\r\nld recite it only when one is in water. Also, it makes the person realize s=\r\nelf immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not really agree God punish people. It all depen=\r\nds on the attitude. If you are doing business with God (I will do this Sadh=\r\nana, and hence you give me this result, and you break the sadhana), God may=\r\n punish.\n&gt; \n&gt; How ever, if you do sadhana only for self realisation and see=\r\nk God, God, I am doing sadhana I can, please help me do better and realise =\r\nyou, God will not punish no matter what. Yes, as Narasimha pointed out, in =\r\nsome cases, God may take away certain things to make your spiritual journey=\r\n faster, but, that is not really a punishment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha, once told me=\r\n, what you think is good for you or your family may not be really good. Onl=\r\ny Ma knows what is good for you. So, don&#39;t specify what you want. Let the M=\r\nother decide what to give.\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, all of us as parents try to give=\r\n best to our kids. Don&#39;t we? Also, if the child misbehaves, we do not hesit=\r\nate to punish them. God is no different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
