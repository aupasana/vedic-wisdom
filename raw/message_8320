I did a bit last year, then stopped and started again last week. I know t=\r\nhe best motivator is one&#39;s own personal experience by doing the practice an=\r\nd I intend to do homams regularly- well, at least once in two weeks at pres=\r\nent (given my work schedule as a trainee doctor). \n\nHowever, in the meantim=\r\ne, it would help to hear about others&#39; positive experiences with their prac=\r\ntice.\n\nDo people feel that their homam practice brings more peace, happines=\r\ns in their lives? \n\nI live in the UK and there is nobody in the city where =\r\nI live to talk to about homams so it is pretty lonely, and quite hard to ge=\r\nt motivated. My family are supportive of me in many ways, but not really in=\r\nterested when it comes to homams/japa etc...they are quite amused/bemused b=\r\ny it all and tolerate it politely. \n\nAny ladies/people living in the UK who=\r\n are interested in starting a homam-at-home group to motivate/support each =\r\nother? (There must be at least one other woman in the UK who&#39;s in this grou=\r\np and interested in homams...please email me!) I&#39;m delighted that women are=\r\n allowed to do homams....it would be great to have a group to support each =\r\nother (I&#39;m sure this is a long shot, but it&#39;s worth asking). \n\nRegards,\n\nAp=\r\narna \n\n\n\n"}}
