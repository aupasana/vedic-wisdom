Yes, now and then you will want seek some personal gain. A =\r\nchild asks mother to do favors. How ever, the mother normally does only tho=\r\nse favors which are reasonable. Mother does not give too much of chocklates=\r\n just becuase the childs asks. Even when she showers her kindness, she know=\r\n how much to do with out spoiling the child.\n\nIf you are asking for persona=\r\nl benefits, it perhaps does not harm, but, refrain from seeking what is bad=\r\n for others (like &quot;that idiot has insulted me today, hence he should meet u=\r\np with an accident&quot;). As long you can control what you desire the mother fo=\r\nr, you are safe.\n\nComing to kundalini - There is no need to fear! In my chi=\r\nld I had perseption that if kundalini awakens, I will get extraordinary pow=\r\ners. Don&#39;t give in to them. Kundalini awaking is awakening of self awarenes=\r\ns. When Kundalini araise, you experiance the God. There is no need to be wa=\r\nry of the same.\n\nWhat are you afraid? Are you afraid, if you get self reali=\r\nsation, you will renounce the world and attain mukthi and your family will =\r\nbe left behind in sadness? If you have so much affinity to the material wor=\r\nld, in all likelyhood kundalini will not raise. So, on your path, if kundal=\r\nini araise, by then your attachment to the material world will be far lesse=\r\nr and you would not be afraid of the consequences any more!\n\nBest regards,\n=\r\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot; &lt;waspieswaspies=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I thought that there was no better plac=\r\ne to ask this question since this is the yahoo group which has inspired me =\r\nto consider doing the Chandi Homam along with Shri Narasimhaji&#39;s words. My =\r\ndesire to praise the Divine Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday e=\r\nspecially now that we are coming close to the auspicious Navratri festival.=\r\n I am plannig to start with the recitation first so that I am up to scratch=\r\n when I start doing the homam. (Learning to walk before learning to run) :)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if you had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams r=\r\negularly. Please kindly share how you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fol=\r\nd. Firstly, I encounter objections from outside from fellow friends and fam=\r\nily members who say that &quot;the Chandi homam isn&#39;t part of the family traditi=\r\non&quot; hence the family devta won&#39;t be pleased or &quot;un-initiated people cannot =\r\nperform such a high level ritual&quot; or even &quot;un-married people cannot get mar=\r\nried if they do this on a regularly basis&quot;! However, the call to praise the=\r\n Mother is stronger and I am prepared to disregard the superstitions.  \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; What I find harder to discard though, are personal objections that I crea=\r\nte for myself..I call it the &quot;I-am-not-worthy-enough&quot; syndrome. I am not co=\r\nnfident of being able to stay completely detached during the homam. I think=\r\n what I am trying to say is that I do not know to what extent my underlying=\r\n motives can remain pure (unselfish) enough. At some point or another won&#39;t=\r\n one end up automatically asking for one&#39;s personal gains? After all, isn&#39;t=\r\n it human nature to confide everything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa m=\r\nujhe new car chaahiye, please give my kids good health/good grades etc? Wil=\r\nl one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting the Paath with these motives in=\r\n mind? In that case, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to &#39;white-=\r\nwash&#39; one&#39;s selfish motives?\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, I have to admit that after list=\r\nening to some tales about regular recitation of the Chandi Paath being asso=\r\nciated with &#39;Kundalini jagran&#39;, I am a bit worried. Can sadhana and &#39;kundal=\r\nini jagran&#39; ever be mutually exclusive? What if one wants to pray for the s=\r\nake of praying only? Do they still have to undergo chakra awakening etc? \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thank u.\n&gt; Somanathan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
