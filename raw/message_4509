Mine follows.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;Mugging =\r\nup of vedas&quot; - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an engineering text =\r\nbook for the exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of=\r\n mantra chanting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma like sandh=\r\nya vandanam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning=\r\n and evening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. Th=\r\ne sadhana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and t=\r\nhereafter for the rest of the life time. I have come across a scholar whose=\r\n fingers keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mant=\r\nra. He has transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installed insid=\r\ne him. This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You see, the reason why I mentioned this is again because=\r\n of a documentary film that was made by Sri Staal regarding the Agnicayana =\r\nhe (and his team) had sponsered in Kerala. He showed some &quot;vedic&quot; priests w=\r\nho chant various mantra from the Vedas for hours everyday for almost all th=\r\neir lives. When he asked them some pertinent queries about what these mantr=\r\nas might mean etc, the priests simply shook their head and came up with a v=\r\nery tame reply that this is how they have been taught to do things. No wond=\r\ner Sri Staal came up with the fancy=C2=A0birds and bees theory from such in=\r\nputs. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I agree that chanting of the Vedas for hours on end is su=\r\nrely a sadhana. For that matter, any focused attention given to any work be=\r\ncomes a sadhana in it&#39;s own rights. But my point is, to understand the real=\r\n import of the Vedas, one must do sadhana for spiritual realization and the=\r\nn and only then can one really claim to say what is truely Vedic and what i=\r\ns not. Sadhana for God realization is the path, and when the realization da=\r\nwns in sufficient degrees, one maybe able to get a really clear perspective=\r\n of what exactly the Vedas talk about. Not with energy flowing through Ida =\r\nnadi, nor with energy flowing through pingla nadi can one understand what t=\r\nhe Vedas truely are. But with energy flowing through the susumna nadi, ther=\r\ne is hope! That is experiential and a result of sadhana aimed at realizing =\r\nthe Self.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; For this transformed being learning bhashya is not nec=\r\nessary. He knows even beforehand what is there in the bhashya and what it m=\r\neans in various planes.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My view is that, Vedas are absolute unco=\r\nrruptable knowledge, and therefore before the above transformation happens,=\r\n ones understanding of the Vedas and what=C2=A0really constitues the ambit =\r\nof Vedic knowledge will be questionable, if not outright incorrect. Hence, =\r\nI see no value in statements like such and such ritual is what Vedas is all=\r\n about and such and such is not. Most people who make such statements are n=\r\nowhere close to any states of realization. Mere intellectual assessements a=\r\nre not really of much value.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If we call Sayana&#39;s commen=\r\ntary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska as well.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Well, i=\r\nf you like Sayanacharya&#39; s commentaries, so be it. I do not consider it sac=\r\nroscant. So we have to=C2=A0just respectfully disagree with each other:). H=\r\nope that is fine with you. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 2. &quot;Vasistha spoke the Yoga=\r\n Vasistham&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Who is the real author of yoga vasishtam Vasishta or=\r\n Valmiki ?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Valmiki notes what Vasistha speaks to Rama.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; 3. &quot;The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By=\r\n extension of your above logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita si=\r\nnce they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Advaita=\r\n ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas (or ways of =\r\nlooking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have different views. \n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; True. Yes there were have been philosophical fights, but that was=\r\n mostly in the Upanishadic and Pouranik periods and not really in the=C2=A0=\r\n original Vedic period. Infact, people (indologists)=C2=A0are not even sure=\r\n of what constitues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurate description =\r\nis a far cry. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Sri Ramakrishna and most of his disciples - who w=\r\nere all self-realized saints - would often comment that from the perspectiv=\r\ne of a sadhaka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be in contradi=\r\nction to one another but supplementary to each other. They explained in man=\r\ny of their writings how each of them (philosophies)=C2=A0had a place and a =\r\nstage and how each were essentially supportive of the different stages and =\r\npaths leading one to the=C2=A0realization of the absolute non-differentiate=\r\nd Brahman. I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n I was talking about the ones who composed the Veda mantras. They were all =\r\nknowing, and all knowledgebale seers. The Upanishats and various emanating =\r\nphilosophies within the ambit of our Sanatana Dharma, all undeniably=C2=A0t=\r\nrace their roots to the Vedas. That means, the satha darshanas are not outs=\r\nide of the realm of the core Vedas. Therefore, the ones who composed the ve=\r\ndic hymns were both jyanis, vigyanis as well as performers of elaborate fir=\r\ne rituals, all combined together. There is no conflict here. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ju=\r\nst like Vasistha says in the Yoga Vasistham, God realization is a bird with=\r\n two wings -right action with the right knowledge. Either of the wings not =\r\nfunctioning, makes the bird come crashing down. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. &quot;Can you =\r\nkindly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; N=\r\no surpirse, That is the essence of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, purnima. =\r\nkuhu, sinivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water, medha =\r\n(intellect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are accorded ele=\r\nvated status. That&#39;s how veda is.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Sorry but that is not really a=\r\nn answer at all! It is not at all the essence of the Vedas, unless you belo=\r\nng to the sect of west influenced spurious indologists who believe that the=\r\n vedic hymns were battle cries and=C2=A0general poetry composed by a group =\r\nof ravaging barbarians who were too awed by the wind and the sun and the da=\r\nwn and other natural phenomenon.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Let me repeat the question I ha=\r\nd asked in my previous mail. If this is the essence of the Vedas, can you e=\r\nxplain in a logical coherent manner, how exactly does these simple natural =\r\nphenomenons lead to the elevated Upanishatic philosophies, when every schoo=\r\nl of thought inside Hinduism traced its roots to the core Vedas? How does o=\r\nne explain this so called=C2=A0jump without taking an allegorical view of t=\r\nhe Vedic hymns? \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 5. &quot;The way one can learn is different based on=\r\n the different models of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!&quot;\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; If one has flying experience on a cessana alone he will not be allowe=\r\nd to fly a boeing. This is why I said I am only against mixing up.\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; One who has learnt flying a cessana can very well learn to fly a boeing =\r\nif he so wishes. It can remove his inhibitions about flying and in future, =\r\nif God will, can learn others as well. What harm therefore in learning to f=\r\nly, with any model what so ever? None absolutely.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 6. &quot;No. Many s=\r\nelf-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39; these artifically created boundaried and a=\r\nchived and experienced higher states. Anything that leads to God is good.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; They have been lucky. For each succesful one there may be many w=\r\nho have also failed miserably.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0I consider this to be an un=\r\nfounded fear. Real sadhana for God realization often does not follow such a=\r\nritificial boundaries. Realization God is never a matter of luck, but a pro=\r\nduct of intense sadhana and patience. And doing a daily homam of any deity =\r\nis a=C2=A0furiously beautiful sadhana. Many are already doing it, many more=\r\n will do in future. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0If one with all purity and best of in=\r\ntentions=C2=A0gives ahutis =C2=A0water on agni instead of ghee, what will b=\r\ne the outcome ? Intention can not justify flouting of rules. Rules only sup=\r\nport and promote intention.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Rules=C2=A0prohibiting a person from=\r\n even trying the ritual is far detremental than making a flawed=C2=A0attemp=\r\nt and learning in the course of it. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Further=C2=A0more, the manu=\r\nals given by Narasimha is definitely not incorrect. Otherwise, so many woul=\r\nd not have been able to do various homas of=C2=A0different deities=C2=A0for=\r\n so long on a regular basis and experience=C2=A0things.

Anything else is dispensable and therefore not =\r\neternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eternal=\r\n truths, nothing short. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It will be interesting here to point ou=\r\nt that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do t=\r\nhe=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. E=\r\nven the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahman=\r\nasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right ha=\r\nnd of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right ha=\r\nnd of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect he=\r\nre. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be pe=\r\nrfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Thank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very per=\r\ntinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by sayi=\r\nng one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and =\r\na few commentaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-reali=\r\nzation, be called a &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fire&quot; =\r\nin his right hand? Never! \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has real=\r\nized the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;=\r\nmay have&quot; spiritual abilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespect=\r\nive of whether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following =\r\na blind tradition without having experienced anything and thus violating th=\r\ne essence of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no =\r\nspiritual consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at =\r\nall they can be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is a=\r\nn empty shell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the =\r\nbare palms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self=\r\n. Both, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Homam is a =\r\nritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn=\r\n&#39;t work.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were fam=\r\nous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic,=\r\n it means they did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themsel=\r\nves in homas and yagyas?=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistha=\r\nm, which is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of differ=\r\nent yagyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they did no=\r\nt &quot;believe&quot; in advaita? \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Your above statement stems from an inco=\r\nrrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trapped in =\r\nduality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make one be=\r\ncome so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won&#39;t mak=\r\ne me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shall remain merely as a self deluded entity=\r\n. Untill one actually experiences the state of non-duality, theoritical tal=\r\nk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delusion. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Adwaith is a state to =\r\nbe achieve. It needs sustained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of=\r\n yore, who were all self-realized beings - and had experienced the state of=\r\n=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such long penances, including elaborate fi=\r\nre rituals on a daily basis. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is not a question of w=\r\nhether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which=\r\n is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what v=\r\nedic authority.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The question is not about being based on &quot;which =\r\nvedic authority&quot; BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it transforming the=\r\n individual? Irrespective of which vedic &#39;authority&#39; says what, if a said s=\r\nadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge and states, it is useless f=\r\nor a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judge is to perform the sa=\r\ndhana and experience for oneself! And this is why there are so many who are=\r\n already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some have experienced paritally,=\r\n some are yet to. And each experience merely rivets one&#39;s mind to the sadha=\r\nna more and more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little u=\r\nse for dry theory. That which cannot be experienced, is of no consequence. =\r\nIt is this perspective that any sadhana, not just the ones mentioned by Nar=\r\nasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. &quot;What I te=\r\nach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Are there d=\r\nifferent ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on what he k=\r\nnows and what he does ?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The flying of the aeroplane is the same.=\r\n The way one can learn is different based on the different models of the ae=\r\nroplanes in which one learns to fly!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 3. &quot;Knowledge of *external =\r\nrituals* is relative and can never be absolute.

That is why these three are used in t=\r\nandem. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 4. &quot;The only knowledge that should (and can) be=\r\n preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*.

What is so big deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to=\r\n address hymns to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities fr=\r\nom the Rig Vedas, which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere =\r\nnature worshipping pagan&#39;s attempting elevated poetry? And if the average w=\r\nord by by word translations or a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is=\r\n to the Vedas, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical s=\r\ntructure between the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upan=\r\nishadic period? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical auth=\r\nority from the Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the t=\r\nwo contexts be bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordi=\r\nngs of=C2=A0 the Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic=\r\n-myths and their later day derivatives?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Any path, ve=\r\ndic, agamic, yogic, tantrik, aghori,=C2=A0if rightly followed exclusively a=\r\nnd fully can lead to the desired objective=C2=A0.

It is based o=\r\nn a dictum called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to b=\r\ne performed on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is e=\r\nver present in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) bra=\r\nhmin. There is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this =\r\nand say that homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, th=\r\nen the problem arises.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As you have said, any system of worship i=\r\ns acceptable. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. N=\r\nobody objects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it confor=\r\nms to the vedic tenets.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Homam is a ritualistic form of worship a=\r\nnd if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is not=\r\n a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is i=\r\nnferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct and=\r\n based on what vedic authority. If you are promoting this homa procedure as=\r\n one of your own design, there is no objection. On the contrary, if you nee=\r\nd the sanction of vedic authority for it, please=C2=A0answer within the amb=\r\nit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts are raised.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The apprehensio=\r\nn is that in the year 2000 you said,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;I cannot possibly finish t=\r\nhis preface without expressing my deep gratitude for my \n&gt; guru Pt. Sanjay =\r\nRath, who has been a constant source of enlightenment, \n&gt; encouragement and=\r\n inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; and now you say\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secrets a=\r\nnd some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all other par=\r\namparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his understand=\r\ning. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;par=\r\nampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and started t=\r\no manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he became c=\r\nommercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, which is rea=\r\nlly superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His theories are like=\r\n beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always maintain=\r\ns an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is convenient to give t=\r\nhe impression that there is more. If anything does not make sense, it could=\r\n be because you have to learn more!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As he started exploiting and=\r\n commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the name of a pa=\r\nrampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dishonesty. After=\r\n expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I started to go=\r\n public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes, I was kicke=\r\nd out of SJC.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, cha=\r\nra karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. =\r\nHe deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work =\r\nconsistently.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some speci=\r\nfic secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are impe=\r\nrfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily created a=\r\n body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teaching=\r\ns that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In 2000 you s=\r\naid\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a pha=\r\nlita dasa. It shows general\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; results. Narayana dasa is comp=\r\nuted differently for different divisional charts and we \n&gt; can use Narayana=\r\n dasa of a divisional chart to predict matters related to that \n&gt; divisiona=\r\nl chart. \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in=\r\n one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends \n&gt; and another starts, one rasi stops=\r\n being the progressed lagna and another rasi \n&gt; becomes one=E2=80=99s progr=\r\nessed lagna. Using the progressed lagna as the reference, we \n&gt; find out th=\r\ne events that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each \n&gt; pe=\r\nrson, with each chart applicable in one dasa. \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; This is a very v=\r\nersatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention to the details of \n&gt; c=\r\nalculation. &quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; now you say\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa may be based=\r\n on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not work with any level o=\r\nf consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You seem to sta=\r\nrt teaching even before you=C2=A0start learning.=C2=A0I&#39; m only afraid it s=\r\nhould not happen in the context of vedic rituals also.

The=\r\nre are many standard homam procedures in the world today, some more elabora=\r\nte than what we teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what proce=\r\ndure one uses and I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regular=\r\nly*, irrespective of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedur=\r\ne for those who do not know any. If you are initiated into a different proc=\r\nedure that you can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you kn=\r\now it. That will make us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot=\r\n be done daily, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do=\r\n daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one sh=\r\nould serve lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, fo=\r\nrks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to=\r\n serve various items in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so comple=\r\nx that one cannot do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once e=\r\nvery few months.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that better or is it better to relax the rules and=\r\n protocols to make it less formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21.

It contains an analogy given earlier and =\r\naddresses some relevant issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------ --------- --------\n&gt; Do V=\r\nedas Describe External Rituals\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people believe that Veda describes=\r\n the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolu=\r\nte, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra=\r\n. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-kaal=\r\na-paatra?\n&gt; \n&gt; Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVe=\r\nda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =\r\n=E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about abs=\r\nolute truths about the inner self and not relative truths about external ma=\r\ntters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immor=\r\ntal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and pu=\r\nrify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various o=\r\nfferings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and =\r\nthe smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Metaphor: Ved=\r\nic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; Notions that so and so yagya ritual is sanct=\r\nioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned =\r\nby Veda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once there were ma=\r\nny people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea an=\r\nd enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the ti=\r\nme]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n&gt; \n&gt; As peop=\r\nle started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], so=\r\nmeone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He sai=\r\nd, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People =\r\nfaithfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n&gt; \n&gt; People started moving =\r\nfurther and further inland and started living in a landlocked desert far aw=\r\nay from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake=\r\n, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards =\r\neast, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk =\r\none mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools of though=\r\nt. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some in=\r\nteresting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then cam=\r\ne some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of wal=\r\nking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the =\r\nsea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea=\r\n, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n&gt; \n&gt; People pe=\r\nrforming the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this horse thi=\r\nng is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different from=\r\n the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even un=\r\nderstand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but the=\r\ny simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that t=\r\nhey were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructio=\r\nns were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instructions c=\r\name from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currently liv=\r\ned and how to get to the sea from there!\n&gt; \n&gt; Slowly many new sets of instr=\r\nuctions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to th=\r\ne sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk towards east=\r\n [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].\n&gt; \n&gt; One particular path through ju=\r\nngles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice=\r\n of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter throu=\r\ngh that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and stronges=\r\nt could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fal=\r\nl in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path w=\r\nere killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, con=\r\ndemned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, =\r\neven people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path des=\r\nisted from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As time progressed, people started fighting too much ab=\r\nout whose path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt t=\r\nhe original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so=\r\n-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and chang=\r\ned times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did no=\r\nt reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual =\r\ngoal of all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow =\r\nthe instructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed g=\r\neographical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went=\r\n to sea, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, fo=\r\nr violating tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; In case the analogy is not clear, here is a bri=\r\nef summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such =\r\nas Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly differen=\r\nt aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-re=\r\nalization. That is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied=\r\n subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that state. While defi=\r\nnitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-real=\r\nization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. On=\r\nly relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path dep=\r\nends on one&#39;s current position!\n&gt; \n&gt; Great men in many spiritual paths, wit=\r\nhin Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, unders=\r\ntood the current state of people around them and gave specific instructions=\r\n on how to reach that state from the current state. Some followed the instr=\r\nuctions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the cont=\r\nradictions between paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; As the meta=\r\nphor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant and di=\r\nstracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one d=\r\noes a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary iss=\r\nues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99=\r\ns focus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just=\r\n as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much ene=\r\nrgy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every=\r\n six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pu=\r\nrsuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives m=\r\nore energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost t=\r\no one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wise Tradeoffs\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose the p=\r\nresident of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One =\r\ncan invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in=\r\n the room individually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange =\r\nlong pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose one=\r\n is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 a=\r\nssociates by name and seats them in the room individually following the pro=\r\ntocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the e=\r\nnd, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates =\r\ntogether and seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time=\r\n to let the President eat in peace?\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, is it wise if one excha=\r\nnges long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut=\r\n short on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a fire ritual=\r\n, making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas=\r\n done to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various prel=\r\niminary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If=\r\n one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in sc=\r\nriptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise t=\r\nradeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &lt;sections deleted&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Proof of the Pudding\n&gt; \n&gt; At this time, more than=\r\n hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spe=\r\nnding time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with a=\r\nn attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual understanding of t=\r\nhe absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good=\r\n to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eatin=\r\ng it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months and se=\r\ne for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and=\r\n clarity of thinking.\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil m=\r\ns.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyoti=\r\nsh writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- moulamagama=\r\ngguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At th=\r\ne outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I h=\r\nad posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings =\r\non &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum=\r\n for discussing these topics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have gone through the homam manual=\r\n provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and h=\r\nave the following observations to make.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. As per rules laid out b=\r\ny srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various ritua=\r\nls, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which i=\r\ns the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa sho=\r\nuld be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka fo=\r\nrm, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and=\r\n which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated =\r\nby acharyas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in the differen=\r\nt sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., bu=\r\nt no omissions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grain=\r\ns, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised usi=\r\nng the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise =\r\nit is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous wor=\r\nk &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the =\r\nsutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of ve=\r\ndic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbh=\r\na aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succee=\r\nding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7.=\r\n The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;d=\r\neva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. Thi=\r\ns can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starti=\r\nng from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8 =\r\nPatraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above da=\r\nrbha is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purific=\r\nation of the utensils is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying=\r\n the utensils is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam =\r\non praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with dar=\r\nbha) is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) i=\r\ns missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and pary=\r\nagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 14. Darv=\r\nee samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always=\r\n to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou) .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 15. Placement of paridhi =\r\nand aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a =\r\nfixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 17. It is seen in =\r\nthe video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis =\r\nare given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahu=\r\nti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and many more ..........=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not =\r\ninvoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier fo=\r\nr the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced =\r\nin satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at al=\r\nl deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. I=\r\nn the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni a=\r\ncts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted i=\r\nnto the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahut=\r\nis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the m=\r\nantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They =\r\ndon&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the ri=\r\nght pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadh=\r\nakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom =\r\nhomam for any devata.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute =\r\nJane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning =\r\nfrom an able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own pu=\r\nrity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to prese=\r\nrve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
