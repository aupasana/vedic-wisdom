It can be a regular \nsadhana. It is not for giving moksha to a soul. It is for releasing a few \nnegative attachments that are blocking a departed mind from going to higher \nlokas or take birth again. If one has rina (debt) with such a mind, the \nnegative attachments and tendencies of that departed mind will influence \none&#39;s mind too. Rituals like tarpana free the dearted mind from the blocking \npredispositions and also free one&#39;s mind of that influence.\n\nHere is an answer from the pitri tarpana manual:\n\n-----------------------------------------\n&quot;External rituals are meant to create the internal visualization needed to \naffect desirable internal changes in the long run. For example, one offers a \nfull coconut into fire as poornaahuti (complete offering) at the end of a \nhomam (fire ritual). This is symbolic of surrendering one&#39;s head or ego \n(sense of I-ness) to god and burning it in the fire of wisdom and becoming \nfree from ego. As one keeps engaging in this act again and again, the \nvisualization becomes stronger and stronger and ego is slowly reduced.\n\n&quot;One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana. Tarpana means &quot;satisfying&quot; or \n&quot;satiating&quot;. One acknowledges the debt one has to devas (gods), rishis \n(sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tries to satisfy them using this \nritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire in a homam, pitris are invoked in \nwater in this ritual, then held in the palm and released in a specific way \nconducive to freeing them.\n\n&quot;One owes a lot to one&#39;s parents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, \none owes all of one&#39;s genetic characteristics to one&#39;s parents and \nancestors. Each ancestor is actually present in the person as a genetic \ncharacteristic. In karmik terms, one inherits some karmas of one&#39;s parents \nand ancestors and each ancestor is actually present in the person as a \nkaarmik predisposition. The latter approach obviously extends to multiple \nlives and some karmik predisposition is inherited from the ancestors from a \npast life too, though they may not be related to one in this life.\n\n&quot;By thinking of the deceased ancestors with gratitude and trying to give \nthem an emancipation, one is actually trying to free oneself from various \nkaarmic predispositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik debt) \nwith several people. One can view this as an external event of satisfying \nand emancipating an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can view \nthis as an internal event of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik \npredisposition. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, one needs to \nexternalize first and perform external rituals, while thinking of what it \nmeans internally. This builds up one&#39;s visualization and slowly brings about \ninternal changes and eventually the desired internal change itself.&quot;\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shanvar4&quot; &lt;shanvar4@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 10:28 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Why Perform Pithri-Tharpanam?\n\n&gt; Namaskaar to all Gurus, esp Narasimha!\n&gt;\n&gt; First, not sure how -and how much -to thank you for your tireless\n&gt; services to provide us with the fantastic and improved version of\n&gt; JHORA!!! But, here&#39;s an expression of gratitude from an unseen student\n&gt; of yours!\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a question but am unsure whether this is the right forum to pose\n&gt; it -please forgive me, the transgression is unintentional.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Q: If our beliefs are firmly rooted in karma and of reincarnation\n&gt; [which I am absolutely], why then should we pray year after year for\n&gt; the departed soul/s?\n&gt;\n&gt; Given that the atman is itself indestructible, what is the necessity to\n&gt; annually set aside a day to perform &quot;tharpanam&quot;? Isn&#39;t this rendered\n&gt; superfluous because of the soul&#39;s independent path, regardless of what\n&gt; other [mere] mortals think or do [whether or not related]?\n&gt;\n&gt; Unless the soul was destined to attain moksha, wouldn&#39;t the soul simply\n&gt; latch onto another body and be re-born?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone to proffer an answer please? Grateful!\n&gt; Venkat\n\n\n"}}
