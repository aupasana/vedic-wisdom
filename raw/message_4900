With\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; virtue of knowledge gained from your previous posts, which =\r\nessentially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that any sattvic material can be=\r\n offered to gods in the homam fire, i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; took a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piec=\r\ne of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; This is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spritual experience. i felt that i gained a lo=\r\nt of positive energy from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam. i strongly f=\r\nelt that my offerings reached mahalakshmi devi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; through the homakunda. Such is the impact of your teaching about\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Homam-significance on me! Thank you, sir.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest&#39;s action duri=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam. When the homam fire was weakened and about to extin=\r\nguish, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; priest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has blown air through his mouth=\r\n directly into teh homa kundam to increase\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the intensity of f=\r\nlames in it :(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i have heard from my grandmother that blowing =\r\nair through mouth into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flame/fire is equal to spitting on i=\r\nt and its a very unholy act. Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i desiste=\r\nd myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that m=\r\ny &#39;fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledg=\r\ne may not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relevant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the homam fire and i sh=\r\nould not interfere with the priest,who seemed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbe well experienced in performing homams.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PLeas=\r\ne comment something about this and enlighten us with your knowledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that i will be careful from next time. Also, if there=\r\n are any other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ingredients specific for mahalakshmi homam, pl=\r\nease suggest us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
