Say a person does 3 malas of a certai=\r\nn \n&gt; mantra \n&gt; &gt; every day. After the first round the person must turn back=\r\n and so \n&gt; on. \n&gt; &gt; I understand this.

I myself attach a paper \n&gt; &gt; clip on the side I finish with so I=\r\n know to start on that side the \n&gt; &gt; very next day or for a different sessi=\r\non on the same day. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope I am being at least somewhat clear.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
