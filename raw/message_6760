I still =\r\ndid not \n&gt; &gt; understand the concept of moksham.\n&gt; &gt; If it is a state of bei=\r\nng, what is that state? Is that state defined \n&gt; &gt; any where in Puranas? Wh=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; found it and being a human why I have to go for it?\n&gt; \n&gt; I will expla=\r\nin using an analogy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once upon a time, there was an ocean. This ocean =\r\nwas vast, still and \n&gt; blissful. Then a force arose within the ocean that d=\r\nisturbed it. There \n&gt; were many waves and ripples on the surface of the oce=\r\nan. Under the \n&gt; influence of the force, the ripples and waves started movi=\r\nng rapidly. \n&gt; Instead of seeing itself as a part of the ocean, each ripple=\r\n thought it \n&gt; was separate entity. Based on other ripples that it hit it n=\r\nicely or \n&gt; abruptly, each ripple started liking some ripples and hating so=\r\nme \n&gt; ripples. Based on the previous moves, each ripple liked moving in som=\r\ne \n&gt; ways and hated some moves. The ripples developed their own likes, \n&gt; d=\r\nislikes, agendas etc. They pushed themselves to move in the way they \n&gt; lik=\r\ned. When that happened, they were elated. When their move crashed \n&gt; agains=\r\nt the force and they were forced to move another way violently, \n&gt; ripples =\r\nwere depressed. They kept getting elated and depressed, liking \n&gt; other rip=\r\nples and hating them, and their likes and agendas kept \n&gt; evolving.\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\nme ripples said all the ripples exist within ocean and hence started \n&gt; wor=\r\nshipping the ocean. Some ripples praised the power of the oceanic \n&gt; force =\r\nthat was responsible for all ripples and started worshipping the \n&gt; force. =\r\nSome said, &quot;this force is not different from ocean. This force is \n&gt; just a=\r\n different manifestation of the ocean. This force and ocean are \n&gt; one&quot;. So=\r\nme even went further and said, &quot;why do I look at myself as a \n&gt; ripple? I A=\r\nM the ocean. I am a part of the ocean. I AM the ocean.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; One day, one r=\r\nipple realized that there was nothing to like or dislike \n&gt; in any move. Th=\r\nere was nothing to like or dislike any other ripple. It \n&gt; realized that it=\r\n was not a  ripple, but it was the ocean itself. All \n&gt; other ripples it wa=\r\ns crashing against were also it (ocean) only. The big \n&gt; force of the ocean=\r\n that was moving everything hither tither was \n&gt; unconfrontable and uncontr=\r\nollable and one needs to just witness what it \n&gt; does and not try to contro=\r\nl it.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that realization, the ripple gave up its agendas to move he=\r\nre or \n&gt; there, its likes and dislikes for certain moves, its likes and dis=\r\nlikes \n&gt; for certain ripples, etc. It just remained there on the surface, b=\r\nut \n&gt; looked at itself as the whole ocean and the force moving it as an \n&gt; =\r\nuncontrollable force that was moving various parts of it (ocean). Under \n&gt; =\r\nthe impact of the force, it still kept moving here and there, hitting \n&gt; th=\r\nis ripple and that ripple, but it stopped resisting or trying to move \n&gt; in=\r\n a specific way. It moved for some more time and the ripple died down \n&gt; af=\r\nter a while. It merged in the ocean. Before, it thought it was ocean \n&gt; and=\r\n not a ripple, but other ripples could see a ripple in its place. Now \n&gt; th=\r\nat it died down, it was truly ocean and there was no ripple there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oth=\r\ner ripples kept resisting the force, trying enforce their agendas, \n&gt; and k=\r\nept moving hither thither and take a new shape when one shape was \n&gt; dying =\r\ndown. They kept revising and pursuing their agendas. The ocean \n&gt; simply wi=\r\ntnessed them and the force kept moving them.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIn the above analogy, the ocean is known as Shiva or Purusha or \n&gt; Brahman/=\r\nAatman. The force within the ocean is known as Shakti or \n&gt; Prakriti or Mah=\r\namaya. The waves and ripples are various deities, demons, \n&gt; human beings, =\r\nanimals and other beings. The movement is their thoughts \n&gt; and actions. Mo=\r\nksha is what is described with one ripple at the end \n&gt; (from &quot;One day, one=\r\n ripples realized..&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; All beings are constantly revising and pursuing=\r\n their agendas, with \n&gt; their own likes/dislikes for some actions and likes=\r\n/dislikes for other \n&gt; beings. They are elated sometimes and depressed some=\r\ntimes. When one \n&gt; realizes the uncontrollable and unconfrontable nature of=\r\n the Shakti that \n&gt; is moving all, one becomes a witness to that Shakti. On=\r\ne may continue to \n&gt; do things to others and exist in the body, but one doe=\r\ns not resist the \n&gt; agenda of Shakti and submits fully. One does good and b=\r\nad things to \n&gt; people without like or dislike for people or for actions. O=\r\nne has no \n&gt; agenda of one&#39;s own. One is in constant bliss. Other people se=\r\ne a body, \n&gt; but one is not identifying with the body. When the momentum is=\r\n over, one \n&gt; gives up body and merges in Brahman. One is not born again.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If you go through the analogy carefully, a lot of concepts will become =\r\n\n&gt; crystal clear - Shiva, Shakti, Shiva-Shaktyaikyata (oneness of Shiva and=\r\n \n&gt; Shakti), jeeva, samskaras, jeevanmukti, moksha etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;     =\r\n               http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Ju=\r\nn 29, 2011 at 3:39 PM, raghs wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen people w=\r\nho talks about moksham.
