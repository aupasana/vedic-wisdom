It&#39;s about a man who succeeds in constant rememberanc=\r\ne of God.\n\nIn a nutshell, it&#39;s an (annonymous) autobiography of an average =\r\nman from 19th century Russia who began to repeat a Christian &#39;mantra&#39; calle=\r\nd the Jesus prayer...&quot;Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me a sinner&quot;...day in=\r\n and day out (after his wife died and he was drawn to the spiritual path). =\r\nAnd slowly he explains how the mantra began to repeat itself constantly in =\r\nhis mind without him having to do anything. He solves the problems of mind-=\r\nwandering and attains\none-pointedness, and various spiritual truths are slo=\r\nwly revealed to him.\n\nBy the way, is there anyone on the forum who has actu=\r\nally experienced this state? If yes, please can you advise how you got ther=\r\ne? How did you overcome obstacles such as laziness, boredom, forgetfullness=\r\n, mind-wandering etc? It would be inspiring to hear your experiences. Readi=\r\nng stories of highly exalted God realised beings is fine, but it&#39;s difficul=\r\nt to relate to them (they seem so far advanced). It sometimes helps to hear=\r\n from someone who was just like you, and how they worked on themselves.\n\nCo=\r\nming back to the book, in the first chapter, he is a &#39;spiritual baby&#39; just =\r\nstarting out on the path and completely ignorant (was an ordinary household=\r\ner, but then wife died and his house burnt down and he became poor) He read=\r\ns in the Bible &quot;pray unceasingly&quot; and becomes fascinated with this idea.\n\nH=\r\ne meets a Guru (an elderly monk) and said &quot;I want to pray unceasingly but I=\r\n don&#39;t know how&quot;. Guru taught him the Jesus prayer and said do 3000 repetio=\r\nns a day of the prayer for one week, 6000 a day the week after, and 12000 a=\r\n day the week after that! After 12000 repetitions a day, he says his tongue=\r\n felt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb were hurting a little from counting t=\r\nhe beads on his\nrosary! But he followed his Guru&#39;s instructions fully.\n\nLat=\r\ner the Guru said, well done...now it&#39;s time to repeat this prayer all the t=\r\nime, keeping other thoughts away as much as possible! How is this possible =\r\nasks the student (as many of us may also ask). The Guru said just try. He t=\r\nries, and succeeds. Quite inspiring.\n\nFor anyone who&#39;s interesting in glanc=\r\ning through a few chapters, a preview is available on google books.\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/books.google.co.uk/books?id=3DPsQ7zEi9AGsC&source=3Dgbs_book_similarbooks\n=\r\n\nHere is a summary of the seeker on wikipedia\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki=\r\n/The_Way_of_a_Pilgrim\n\nOm Namo Narayanaya\n\nAparna\n\n\n"}}
