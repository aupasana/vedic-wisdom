The manes who are invoked in pitri tarpana have some \nstrong desires. Their ethereal bodies have more restrictions than deities. \nTo make it a bit easier for them to come and leave, standard rules involve \nsome place restrictions.\n\n(2) I personally do it also for the seven rishis of my gotra. You can add \nthe 1/3/7 rishis of your gotra if you know them. There is no need to do more \ntimes in one sitting.\n\n(3) Yes, it is ok. Durva (sacred grass used for purification) can be reused. \nWater can be thrown away at the base of a tree or a plant.\n\n(4) Only for pitri tarpana.\n\n(5) Yes. If a deity has a desire, you are doing your part in fulfilling it. \nEvery embodied being (embodied in gross and ethereal matter) has desires and \nstuck in maya to some extent or the other. You fulfil your duty towards them \nand repay your debt to them by offering tarpana to satisfy their desires.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 19, 2009 1:26 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Some tarpan queries\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading the tarpan manual. I am plannaing to start doing\n&gt; tarpan, actually initially I did not have a place to do it. I live\n&gt; in a one room house with no balcony or courtyard. Now I found an\n&gt; outside place where I can do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Why is this place restriction given for tarpana?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) In the Rishi tarpana, is it always necessary to do tarpan for the\n&gt; nine Rishis whos name is mentioned? Or can I do it for the Rishi of\n&gt; my Gotra and do it more number of times at one sitting?\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) I am planning to do only the Rishi and Dev tarpana, is that ok?\n&gt; Also after saying the mantras, and it is finished what to do with\n&gt; the water pot and durvas?\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) Seamease seeds should be used only for pitri tarpan or also for\n&gt; RIshi and Deva tarpan?\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) In the deva tarpan can I take the name of my Devata for tarpan?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
