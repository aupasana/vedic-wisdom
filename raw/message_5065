I finally got to \nread a little from it. I am impressed =\r\nwith this work.\n\nThe book is called &quot;Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hi=\r\nnduism Studies in \nAmerica&quot; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicola=\r\ns and Aditi Banerjee). \nIt has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 section=\r\ns.\n\nPerverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upo=\r\nn India \nand Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted re=\r\nsearches in \nthe name of academic freedom at the religious studies departme=\r\nnts of western \nuniversities, published them and gained name and fame, tram=\r\npling the sacred in \nthe process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with th=\r\nis will not improve the \nsituation or solve the problem. Interested religio=\r\nus scholars have to firmly and \npatiently crtique these works in the same a=\r\ncademic style, in order to reclaim \nthe rightful place for Hinduism.\n\nSever=\r\nal papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by western=\r\n \nscholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious, hast=\r\ny, \nnonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.\n\n*=\r\n * *\n\nI will just give an example of the offensive work that was rebutted i=\r\nn this \nbook. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive writings shoul=\r\nd skip the \nnext three paragraphs.]\n\nJeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago vi=\r\nsited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal \nand did research on Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa. Several people there \nenthusiastically helped him in the resear=\r\nches. In the end, what he produced is \nutterly nonsensical and filled with =\r\nlies. He published his PhD dissertation \nwithout showing it to Ramakrishna =\r\nMission people to check for factual or \nlinguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishn=\r\na mission people found out about what he \nproduced only years later, after =\r\nhis book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based on the PhD \ndissertation won great acclaim in=\r\n the West. He won an award at the Americal \nAcademy of Religion for that bo=\r\nok, landed a job at Harvard and his book was \nsadly mentioned in the Encycl=\r\nopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for \nlearning about Ramakrishn=\r\na.\n\nIn the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a=\r\n \nhomosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit =\r\nwell \nand did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mission for this=\r\n work. He \nused his own faulty translations, willful distortions and manipu=\r\nlation of \nsources to arrive at sensational (and damning) conclusions. For =\r\nexample, he \ntranslated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the conte=\r\nxt of Swami \nBrahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then=\r\n) sitting in \nRamakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word that means &quot;touching =\r\nsoftly&quot; as \n&quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.\n\nE=\r\nven in places where there was no material to mis-translate, he simply \nspec=\r\nulated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri and \nRamakris=\r\nhna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita \nveda=\r\nnta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and experience \nnirvi=\r\nkalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, a homosexually=\r\n \noriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with another, stark=\r\n-naked \nman. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and more=\r\n especially, \nhis penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How =\r\ncould it not?&quot; \nPlease note that he is not referring to any source and mis-=\r\ntranslating it, but \nsimply speculating based on his perverted agenda!\n\n* *=\r\n *\n\nIf you see the book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholars=\r\nhip \ndriven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people und=\r\ner asuric \ninfluences make their livelihood, money and fame lying and sprea=\r\nding falsehoods \nabout Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n\nThose who=\r\n are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this \nan=\r\nd go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhana to \nstr=\r\nengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will automatically weaken. \nHo=\r\nwever, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically is really =\r\n\nrequired on the ground.
