So for me your are my Guru (least adrishya guru) from whom =\r\nI receive (derive) guidance  \n\nLately i have decided to start reciting Nara=\r\nyan Kavach. As usual i am in doubt as can i start such a practice with an i=\r\nnitiation from a Guru.? \n\nAlso my search through the webpages to get a copy=\r\n of Naryan Kavach lead me to confusion. \nOn one site I got a version which =\r\nis completely different from an sanskrit version available on site : http:/=\r\n/sanskritdocuments.org/doc_1_index.html. \n\nAlso this Sanskrit version menti=\r\nons the whole dialogue between the Rishi and the King. My confusion is for =\r\na sadhana shall i recite the Narayan Kavach as some dialogue between Rishi =\r\nand King or is there a complete separate prayer as Kavach?  \n\nTo add to my =\r\nconfusion i found a paper by Robert Koch from a SJC conferece on Narayan da=\r\nsa. In this he mentions about this kavach and  quotes three  mantras viz 1.=\r\n om vi&#7779;&#7751;ave nama&#7717; \n                          2. om namo n=\r\n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;ya\n                          3. om namo bhagava=\r\nte v&#257;sudev&#257;ya \n\nand says that reciting them as daily sadhana will=\r\n help.  \n\nSo i request you to please guide me as what is Narayan Kavach, ho=\r\nw shall one put it into sadhana and if possible could share a copy of this =\r\nKavach in the form it is to be recited. \n\n\nsincerely \nAshutosh\n\n\n"}}
