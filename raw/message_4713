More than 2012, it is the decade tha=\r\nt follows 2012 that is more interesting to me!\n \nCommunism lost to capitali=\r\nsm in 1980s and everybody thought capitalism won. I am afraid capitalism wi=\r\nll fall too, in the coming decade, and we will be forced to re-invent a bet=\r\nter ism based on eastern ideals. People talk of a stock market bubble and a=\r\n real estate bubble, but the real bubble that I am afraid is bursting now i=\r\ns the &quot;consumption bubble&quot;. As the western consumption bubble seeks to swal=\r\nlow the entire world including China and India, earth with all its natural =\r\nresources simply cannot sustain that bubble and the culture behind it.\n \nBa=\r\nsically, western dominance of the world is on its last legs. Eastern ideas =\r\nwill take hold again over the next few decades and that phase will last for=\r\n a few centuries.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; speculative exploration of rebi=\r\nrth and not based\n&gt; on any documented or verifiable facts\n \nThe current dis=\r\ncussion on rebirth has been philosophical and not based on any astrology pr=\r\ninciples.\n \nHaving said that, there is some data collected by Sri KN Rao on=\r\n rebirth and available in his book. He gives one life&#39;s birthdata and death=\r\ndata and next life&#39;s birthdata in each example. These are the people who re=\r\ncollected their previous lives and gave some specific details accurately, w=\r\nhich were verified by independent researchers. Sri Rao painstakingly collec=\r\nted the data. The data is very valuable.\n \n&gt; What should the astrologers&#39; r=\r\nole must be, at this time...?\n \nAs the world changes and sanatana dharma is=\r\n re-established, astrological knowledge of rishis will be re-established to=\r\no. No wonder Parasara&#39;s BPHS text was recompiled in time for this phase in =\r\nthe last few decades and scholars have access to the entire text after a lo=\r\nng time now! This is the time to humbly acknowledge our shortcomings and wo=\r\nrk on improving our knowledge of this craft. In the next two decades, those=\r\n who are proud of their knowledge will be left behind and dharmik people si=\r\nncerely seeking the knowledge of rishis and working hard on it will be rewa=\r\nrded.\n \nMore than what astrologers can do, a better question is what everyb=\r\nody can do to make the changes easy. People can do spiritual sadhana and tr=\r\ny to attain a peaceful and blissful state of mind. The more such people, th=\r\ne easier and smoother the changes will be. Apart from helping oneself, one =\r\nwill help the world by engaging in spiritual sadhana.\n \nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic=\r\n-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;jyotish_vani@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; V=\r\ninay_ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; You wrote: &quot;At present, this world does not deserve their ser=\r\nvice.

Together, they nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction =\r\nof spiritual India for the next century. None of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of re=\r\nbirthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a powerful and logi=\r\ncally correct observation by Narasimha. Anyone who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; claims to be Rama=\r\nkrishna or Ma Sarada, MUST BE associated and surrounded by a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bunch o=\r\nf ATLEAST 15/20 very high caliber sadhakas.=C3=82  These very high caliber =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhakas=C3=82 who will surround a reborn Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada w=\r\nill each be like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual stalwarts in their own rights, like each =\r\nof Ramakrishna and Ma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada&#39;s disciples were (Swami Brahmananda, Sw=\r\nami Premananda, Swami Sivananda \n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc etc) when they had=C3=82 incarna=\r\nted. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So unless this condition is met, (which Ra=\r\nmakrishna himself had specified in his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; last birth), most of the Rama=\r\nkrishna or Ma Sarada reincarnation-claimants have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be dis-qualifie=\r\nd. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have an impression that if and w=\r\nhen Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swamiji reincarnate, they would ha=\r\nve an association with the Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mission. This is, in my opini=\r\non, an incorrect assumption. When Lord Krishna was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; born, he did not =\r\nspend his time trying to find out where is Ayodhya since he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was=C3=\r\n=82 also=C3=82 Lord Rama is his=C3=82 past life. Similarly,=C3=82 these sou=\r\nls (Ramakrishna and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=C3=82 Sarada and their disciples)=C3=82 are o=\r\nf such high caliber that they do come back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; when it is designed and n=\r\needed for them to come back and perform some strong \n&gt; &gt; &gt; objectives and s=\r\net in motion a spiritual impulse in this land based on the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessiti=\r\nes of the specific desh-kaal-patra. Therefore what they do will be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\nased purely on the zeitgeist - spirit of the times - when they incarnate.=\r\n=C3=82  For \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all one knows, Ramakrishna may not incarnate as a simple=\r\n rustic villager any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; more, but rather=C3=82 as a well-educated,=C3=\r\n=82 city-bred individual with the practical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence of ten Chan=\r\nakyas who might end up changing the political and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual future o=\r\nf this land for centuries to come, which is what the necessity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of th=\r\ne present=C3=82 times really are. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We already ha=\r\nve an overdose of Swamis and Babas and Mas and Bhagwans and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as=\r\nhrams and their teeming millions as followers. What we need is someone who=\r\n=C3=82 may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or may not have an ashram, who may or may not pose as a G=\r\nuru in the traditional \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense, who may or may not be a glib talker (a=\r\ns so many of the Babas and Mas are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; these days), but who has the nece=\r\nssary might and power to affect or initiate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changes in this land whi=\r\nch would be of an irrevocable nature.=C3=82  It is time for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1000 y=\r\nears of history to change. And only a soul of Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada&#39;s \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; caliber can do it. Anyone lesser, would only fizz out=C3=82 with time.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that=C3=82 they (Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C3=82=\r\n Swamiji) will find the work to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy at all. For startes, the dun=\r\nces would be in confederacy against them. When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekanada, before he=\r\n became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was bitterly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opposed by t=\r\nhe &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city on various issues. Then a young \n&gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\not-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and decided he will leave Kasi and neve=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; return to that city untill he &quot;falls on society like a thunderbolt=\r\n&quot;. Well, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is precisely what he did. He fell on Indian society li=\r\nke a thunderbolt, after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which those very pandits of Kasi wrote to hi=\r\nm, asking him to come and grace \n&gt; &gt; &gt; their city! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; So let us keep our fingers crossed and not=C3=82 focus on emtpy specula=\r\ntions, rather \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wait for the most interesting coming=C3=82 decade to u=\r\nnfold in all its=C3=82 sound and fury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, what would be your name and religion and natio=\r\nnality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though religion usually sta=\r\nys the same, it CAN \n&gt; &gt; &gt; change. Nationality can of course change too. Jo=\r\nb, skills, external nature, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; looks, gender, even yoni (human, cow, go=\r\nat, chicken, tiger etc) can all change \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Basically, the seed of one&#39;s new birth is formed at the time of one&#39;s =\r\ndeath. As \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s connection is severed with the body, the last desire=\r\ns/thoughts/ponderings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the mind become the seed for the next life.=\r\n Nature chooses for one a future \n&gt; &gt; &gt; course that allows one to pursue th=\r\nose desires, as much as allowed by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous karmas and debts.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one is able to not entertain ANY desire as one element afte=\r\nr another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All =\r\nthe spiritual sadhana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall =\r\nrecognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I and you like each oth=\r\ner and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they will start =\r\noff taking a liking to each other. If I and you dislike each \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other a=\r\nnd your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they will start off \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndisliking each other. This will happen without either being consciously awa=\r\nre of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who one was and who the other person was, in the last life.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and so=\r\n person is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so person is a reb=\r\nirth of Paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The reborn person may not look like the old person or do similar work or=\r\n have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much *external* similarity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; =\r\none. After all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle),=\r\n while Krishna had thousands \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of wives. Rama was a great warrior and =\r\nkilled Ravana in the biggest war of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; times. Krishna was a key pla=\r\nyer in the biggest war of his time, but did not take \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a weapon at all=\r\n. The game can be diffent in each coming..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul, it can become a t=\r\nrap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be =\r\nback after 100 years \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and that everybody else who came with him would=\r\n have to come back with him. When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi prote=\r\nsted, he said they did not have a choice! Even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda sai=\r\nd once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once more. The Master \n&gt; &gt; &gt; said I am =\r\nto come back once more with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you have to come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nback because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied, &quot;souls like that have g=\r\nreat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ramakrishna said that peopl=\r\ne would get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; liberated en masse during his next coming and that would=\r\n be the last opportunity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time to come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inter=\r\nestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good saint =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai B=\r\naba said \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that he identified a particular young man as the reincarnat=\r\nion of Swami \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata =\r\nand more than twenty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disciples of a very high caliber and different =\r\naptitudes. Together, they nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual =\r\nIndia for the next century. None of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are=\r\n surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It i=\r\ns not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themselves an=\r\nd of course ego is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the root of delusion!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, is it=\r\n necessary to recognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd Y are different and play a different game? A small discussion on this poi=\r\nnt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though external factors like nationality, religion, na=\r\nme, job, looks, gender etc \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can change, some internal factors may rem=\r\nain the same. Moreover, who one likes, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who one dislikes, what values=\r\n one is attracted to internally, etc, may remain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially the sam=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as M=\r\nuslim emperor Akbar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and th=\r\ne other was a Muslim. However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; both were very brave, unafraid of dea=\r\nth, inherently spiritual, had a refined \n&gt; &gt; &gt; taste in fine arts and had d=\r\neep conviction. The previous connections with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Ak=\r\nbar being born and raised when his mother was hiding at a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rajput hou=\r\nsehold, before moving to Delhi. Despite being a Muslim, he actually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhelped the Hindu causes (to the extent possible at that time) by putting an=\r\n end \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to barbaric practices like killing defeated Hindu kings and all=\r\n Hindu priests in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conquered places. He promoted acceptance of other =\r\nfaiths, canceled pilgrimage \n&gt; &gt; &gt; taxes on Hindus and even came up with hi=\r\ns own religion of humanity towards the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; end of his life by integratin=\r\ng various religions. In one life, he tried to save \n&gt; &gt; &gt; India from invadi=\r\nng barbarians.
