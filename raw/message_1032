Everything tends to have two sides,\ndepending on our state of mind one =\r\nside resonates more than other.\n\nNow with respect to ista devata, we can de=\r\nviate little bit here. I\nhave seen two types of sadgurus, one type that alw=\r\nays give same mantra\nto all their disciples as they have realized that mant=\r\nra and have full\nconfidence in it. There is also other type which give out =\r\nmantras\nbased on the disciple, some examples are Ramakrishna paramhans and =\r\nthe\nGuruji of famous astrologer Shri K N Rao. Both types of Sadgurus were\nv=\r\nery capable to see the past. present and future of their respective\ndiscipl=\r\nes. So both these methodolgies are correct. How do we\nexplain/apply here th=\r\ne concept of ista devata and bhadkesh in this case.\n\nFurther I have read in=\r\n a book about a disciple of Swami Ramananda( The\nvery realized saint who st=\r\narted ramanandi samparadaya). There used to\nbe one king in Rajasthan, he wa=\r\ns a devi upashak, devi used to manifest\nto him and so he was asked for a bo=\r\non by devi and he asked for\nmooksha. The devi indicated to him that she can=\r\nnot grant it, but he\nshould go to Swami Ramananda and become his disciple a=\r\nnd get\ninitiation from him, that will get him Mooksha. Also if you look at\n=\r\ndisciples of Swami Ramanada, like Ravidas, Kabir, and many others they\nall =\r\nhad very unique experiances and different types of devotion,\nMirabai was a =\r\nkrishna devotee.\n\nSo we can easily conclude that the ista devata has many f=\r\norms and it\nis a concept that applies to many births rather than just one b=\r\nirth.\n\nIsta devata to clear up ones sanskars can in one life also take the\n=\r\nrole of bhadkesh and also a different form.\n\nThe most important thing is on=\r\ne should respect all forms and pursue a\nform rigourously to which one is at=\r\ntracted most, rest all will fan out\nin time, there are no short cuts.\n\nFrom=\r\n an astrology perspective, there is some confusion too,\nIsta devata is comp=\r\nuted from the 12th house from atmakaraka in D9\nchart. However for atmakarak=\r\na some people include rahu and some donot.\nThere is 7 karaka scheme or 8 ka=\r\nraka scheme and then there is also\nkaraka replacement. Based on this one ca=\r\nn get potentially 3 different\natmakarakas and so 3 different ista devatas. =\r\nSo which ista devata to pick?\n\nIt appears to me that we are not that advanc=\r\ned to relate concepts of\nastrology and spiritualism perfectly yet. There is=\r\n still lot of gray area.\n\nHope this helps you to stir some more thoughts in=\r\n your mind and see\nthings differently.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot;\n&lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mit=\r\neshji Namaste!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much for your post. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think I unde=\r\nrstand what you mean.

The role of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ishta devata \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to give mok=\r\nsha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; objects of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; universe. &quot;Supreme cosmic being&quot; (known by various names) is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nbserver of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all with non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Severa=\r\nl deities \n&gt; &gt; play \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific roles in the universe at the lower le=\r\nvel and become one \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supreme cosmic being at a higher leve=\r\nl. Accordingly, one may start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; praying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a specific form of =\r\na deity with a specific role in the \n&gt; &gt; universe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rea=\r\nlize a higher form of the deity and then become liberated \n&gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; higher form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For this reason, some (especi=\r\nally some gurus at Sri Jagannath\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Centre) even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say that only =\r\nVishnu&#39;s incarnations can be ishta devatas giving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moksha and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n other deities cannot be. This is partly logical, but based on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nisconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-\n&gt; &gt; pervading=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or Surya =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lakshmi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too t=\r\nhat form qualifies as \n&gt; &gt; ishta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devata who enables moksha (libera=\r\ntion). For example, Ganapathi \n&gt; &gt; Atharva \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seersham describes a su=\r\npreme cosmic being form of Ganapathi, from \n&gt; &gt; whom \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahma, Vishn=\r\nu and Shiva come. Suryopanishat describes a supreme \n&gt; &gt; cosmic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\ning form of Surya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva come. And \n&gt; &gt; so on.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may start with the worship of Ganesha who removes obst=\r\nacles \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize a form of Ganesha that is bey=\r\nond gunas and from whom \n&gt; &gt; Brahma,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vishnu, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva, Surya, A=\r\ngni, Vaayu etc are born. One may start with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worship of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; L=\r\nakshmi who gives prosperity and money and finally realize a form \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who drives the thoughts and actions of all beings. One=\r\n may start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worship of Saraswati who gives knowledge=\r\n and finally realize a \n&gt; &gt; form of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saraswati who is the root of a=\r\nll creation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, one starts worshipping one&#39;s ishta deva=\r\nta and slowly \n&gt; &gt; evolves to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping a higher all-pervading f=\r\norm of that deity, who may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem like a different d=\r\neity to a casual observer. This is the \n&gt; &gt; natural \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process of evo=\r\nlution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saptashati ra=\r\nhasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) \n&gt; &gt; describes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; process of creation. It says that first there was Mahalakshmi with\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; three \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gunas. She divided herself into 3 parts - Mahakali with t=\r\namas \n&gt; &gt; (ichchhaa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - the force behind desire), Mahalakshmi =\r\nwith sattwa (jnaana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the force behind knowledge) and =\r\nMahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the \n&gt; &gt; force \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind action) with r=\r\najas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted \n&gt; &gt; to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, trigunatmika Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires/thoughts, knowledge/perception and actions of all beings =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, chapter 11 =\r\ntowards the end of Chandipath prays to Devi \n&gt; &gt; (divine \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother) a=\r\nfter all her exploits and addresses Her in the prayer as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Naaraaya=\r\nni&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraayana as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme cosmic \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came, trigunatmika\n&gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\nahalakshami (or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narayani) is his energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, th=\r\ne Divine Mother of Chandipath is not really different \n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nhalakshmi I have been worshipping for many years. I originally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starte=\r\nd out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping Lakshmi with 4 hands who sita on a lotus and giv=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; money. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later realized that a higher form of the same dei=\r\nty is the energy \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narayana (supreme cosmic being) and She i=\r\ns responsible for the \n&gt; &gt; birth, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sustenance and destruction of al=\r\nl beings including Brahma, Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whichever deity you are attached to and worsh=\r\nip as your ishta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devata, please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to imagine that deity as=\r\n the all-pervading supreme cosmic \n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom the e=\r\nntire creation evolves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath =\r\nCentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\n--- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, January 15, 20=\r\n09 11:44 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on Istha devata to Nar=\r\nasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was r=\r\neading up on the old mail about how your started doign \n&gt; &gt; Chandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Homa.
