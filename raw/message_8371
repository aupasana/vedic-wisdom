Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide s=\r\no that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon him=\r\nself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want h=\r\nim to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to =\r\ncool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the wint=\r\ners calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abus=\r\ne him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is=\r\n this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants=\r\n to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled,=\r\n and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, y=\r\nou know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I lo=\r\nve &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That las=\r\nt line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving=\r\n the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere us=\r\nage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and =\r\ngives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which lead=\r\ns to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremos=\r\nt proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no ec=\r\nonomies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just be=\r\ncause he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most=\r\n of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combin=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business.=\r\n And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man l=\r\noves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is=\r\n a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her bod=\r\ny, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you anoth=\r\ner story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a c=\r\nertain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, in=\r\nfact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actual=\r\nly care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don=\r\n&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri=\r\n maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane=\r\n than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he we=\r\nnt on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love?=\r\n???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, anot=\r\nher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake.=\r\n All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but da=\r\nre I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it=\r\n will be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i=\r\n become big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa k=\r\na kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that g=\r\nod herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and=\r\n I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, des=\r\nerve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is =\r\neventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surre=\r\nndered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bh=\r\nagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, =\r\nnot partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up an=\r\nd saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bh=\r\nagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surren=\r\nder is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go=\r\nd&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, b=\r\ne it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same =\r\nthing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grac=\r\ne this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break=\r\n his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion =\r\nand love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutt=\r\non, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t =\r\nbring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wan=\r\nts master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us ,=\r\n and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy wit=\r\nh what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken,=\r\n who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, ph=\r\nir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal=\r\n bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconscious=\r\nly want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never w=\r\nant food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want h=\r\nim, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish=\r\n dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that mast=\r\nerji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket,=\r\n that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag =\r\nat his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nabout the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left ha=\r\nnded path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

It bec=\r\nomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who is =\r\nin love with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in H=\r\nyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 de=\r\ngree centigrades and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was get=\r\nting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the su=\r\nn asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortabl=\r\ne???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this very\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with swe=\r\nat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming o=\r\nut to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive h=\r\nim away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? =\r\nAnd to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,t=\r\nhe man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely=\r\n, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, t=\r\nhe man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.=\r\n&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers =\r\nwe hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb i=\r\ns so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because =\r\nof him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads t=\r\no all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, thi=\r\ns planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gd=\r\np, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true l=\r\nove it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give =\r\none shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking =\r\nabout people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are qu=\r\nite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn=\r\n&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Ju=\r\nst because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah=\r\n!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy =\r\nI know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has=\r\n never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his =\r\nexistence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why=\r\n/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculous=\r\nly devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so =\r\nlove her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He=\r\n told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide he=\r\nr daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe=\r\n yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apn=\r\ni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot=\r\n of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you =\r\nthat you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then=\r\n claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The mom=\r\nent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but t=\r\nhen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to kno=\r\nw whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  R=\r\nather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come an=\r\nd tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that s=\r\nhe (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I h=\r\nave her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\no top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I need t=\r\no do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki nau=\r\nkri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, =\r\neven if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;goo=\r\nd&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage =\r\nto surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe=\r\n you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi =\r\nor be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nne of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master b=\r\nrings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is =\r\nwagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an aft=\r\nerthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with god, and=\r\n what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master brings,=\r\n because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya pane=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, =\r\nbhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\ne actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want hi=\r\nm,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit p=\r\nissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOU=\r\nSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch=\r\n, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely=\r\n do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of =\r\ngreat dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and=\r\n pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is mental =\r\nmasturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if you =\r\nbecome dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye ho=\r\nye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.
