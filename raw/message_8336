Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are often done for material gai=\r\nns. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras of various deities contain a ph=\r\nalastuti (the expected results), is that not material gain? Doing a Mahamri=\r\ntyunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn&#39;t that a material gain? It is not =\r\nthe path, but the attitude of the sadhaka which determines for what he/she =\r\nis performing a certain sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogis and/or those who=\r\n do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis=\r\n, which can come as a byproduct of the path. The problem is not with siddhi=\r\ns per se, it is with misusing them or commercializing them or hanging on to=\r\n them. Any sadhaka who can gain a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi wh=\r\nenever he/she wants. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has=\r\n a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it stands today, is roughly divided into t=\r\nwo major geographic and philosophical demarcations. The style practiced in =\r\nSouth India - mostly Dakshina Margi - and that practiced in Bengal and adja=\r\ncent areas - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal opinion, the adherents of th=\r\ne path in both cases, generally speaking, have been trapped in two delusion=\r\ns born out of collateral byproducts of their respective paths. The first st=\r\nep of Shakti sadhana is generating shakti. Second step is holding the shakt=\r\ni. Third step is channeling the shakti. In view of this, one school of Tant=\r\nra that is prevalent today has tied itself up in too much of technicalities=\r\n, such that on an average they forget to capture shakti (here shakti means =\r\nenergy, not Shakti the supreme Goddess). WHile the other school is able to =\r\ngenerate and hold shakti much better, only to commercialize the same and/or=\r\n misuse it (generally speaking,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  expcetions are there too). End resul=\r\nt, both eventually do not end up producing enough genuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic l=\r\niabilities one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A fair exchange is ne=\r\nver a robbery, as Vimalananda says. Theoretically, when the *right person* =\r\nperforms many of the things mentioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff =\r\nthere is not exactly accurately portrayed), he/she will know how to balance=\r\n the karmic impact well. In the hands of an immature individual, it can lea=\r\nd to disaster. Further, the so called division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; a=\r\nnd &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clear as it is made out there. Each in=\r\nfluences the other and is very much intermingled.=C2=A0 Every sadhana in Va=\r\nma Margi Tantra has a firm spiritual basis. Performed correctly, with the r=\r\night attitude, and by the right individual, it leads to very high spiritual=\r\n states.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hota hain sh=\r\nab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaa=\r\nn mere nazdeek\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  From: priyank_priyank &lt;aks_day@=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 12 June 2012=\r\n 10:14 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;materi=\r\nal sadhana&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I h=\r\nave been following some tantra groups and in tantra there seems to be 3 att=\r\nitudes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
