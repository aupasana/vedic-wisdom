However, I missed the Amavasya day. \n\n1. As per the manual, thi=\r\ns tarpana can be performed on any day, any week, any fortnight, and every m=\r\nonth but there are some special days as well. Is it fine to start from the =\r\ncoming Saturday/Sunday and then perform it every fortnight?\n\n2. In the manu=\r\nal, after the Rishi tarpana section, one moves to Divya Manushya tarpana. H=\r\nere, one is supposed to use the same water pot containing the akshatas as i=\r\nn the earlier Rishi tarpana section?\n\n3. After the Divya Manushya tarpana, =\r\none moves to the Divya Pitri and Pitri sections. Here, one is supposed to p=\r\nut some black sesame seeds to the water in the pot. Does this mean that one=\r\n adds the black sesame seeds to the water already containing the akshatas i=\r\nn the water pot? So, one gives tarpana to Divya Pitris and Pitris with wate=\r\nr containing akshatas and sesame seeds or water containing only sesame seed=\r\ns?\n\nI eagerly await your replies to the above questions.\n\nThanks and best r=\r\negards,\nManish\n\n\n"}}
