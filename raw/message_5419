It is a sign of the times we live in. People get the gurus that they deserve.\n \nHowever, I humbly suggest that our critical abilities should not be wasted on people and things that we do not have a responsibility to change. Critical abilities should be directed inward to critique oneself, towards people one has a responsibility towards, such as one&#39;s sishyas, and towards things where one has a duty to accomplish something. Why criticize other people? Let them engage in their games and make progress at their own pace. Apne ko kya lena dena (what have we got to do with them)?\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Andaz apne dekhte hai aaine me woh,\n&gt; aur ye bhi dekhte hai koi dekhta na ho !\n\n\n"}}
