I w=\r\nas listening to Shri LakshmiNarayan Hridayam the other day but I could not =\r\nunderstand why one does the Narayan Hridayam first and then the Laxmi Hrida=\r\nyam to finally end the puja with the Narayan Hridayam once again. \n\nWhen Sh=\r\nri LakshmiNarayan comes to mind..just like Shri LakshmiNarasimha or ShivaSh=\r\nakti..the deities are conceived as one single entity, so why separate recit=\r\nations? \n\nAlso, can anyone tell me the sources where I can find other praye=\r\nrs/shlokas/stutis/mantras for Shri Lakshminarayan?\n\nMany thanks,\nS\n\n\n"}}
