Purusha is the witness=\r\n of it all.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphala tha=\r\nt is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmapha=\r\nla, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on par=\r\nt of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very =\r\ncomplicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking o=\r\nf agents for their delivery.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; At any time, some karma=\r\ns from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot;=\r\n pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; poo=\r\nl and the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon.=\r\n The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the bal=\r\nancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; The=\r\n assignment and ordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as on=\r\ne engages in various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new p=\r\neople enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agent=\r\ns and sequencing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; As one engages in=\r\n remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transfo=\r\nrm one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics =\r\nwith other beings (including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agent=\r\ns of delivery of karmaphala, who operate through other people who act as ph=\r\nysical agents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result=\r\n. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down =\r\nin order within the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to=\r\n a higher pool or pushed up in order within the same pool.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0W=\r\nhen someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behind it (=\r\nthis is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arranging k=\r\narmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people around =\r\none, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to g=\r\nive karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala =\r\nanytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; However, remember t=\r\nhat the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that it is tryin=\r\ng to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but you need a=\r\n large force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If there =\r\nis no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific result, nobody =\r\ncan make one experience that result, no matter what ritual one does. Howeve=\r\nr, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their optional pool an=\r\nd even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their optional pool, an=\r\nd hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make some differe=\r\nnce.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitr=\r\na&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the =\r\nfruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings=\r\n, who may show favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The =\r\nHe-aspect of God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-as=\r\npect of God is the power that impartially and impassionately manages the fi=\r\nne balance and order within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are=\r\n equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saint=\r\ns. She administers just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using av=\r\nailable agents.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; The karmas we committed in the past are =\r\nalready in the pipeline and will give their results sooner or later. The be=\r\nst we can do with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewh=\r\nat. The most important thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the p=\r\nipeline now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or har=\r\nm to others are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause plea=\r\nsure or benefit to others are good karmas.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; When it comes=\r\n to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, t=\r\nhrough conscious effort and current action, yes, it is possible and general=\r\n guidelines are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the sp=\r\necific impact of each action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for =\r\novercoming a karma has to be commensurate with the karma itself.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; You need only small force to push a cat out of your way, but need=\r\n a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.ve=\r\ndicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;____________________=\r\n____________\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan \n&gt;&gt; &gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0Digamber,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special ele=\r\nphant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king.

Whose karma=\r\n is this?=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This i=\r\ns the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) This is t=\r\nhe karma of the beggar turned king.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Everything is interrelate=\r\nd. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to =\r\nbe the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to ap=\r\npoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them t=\r\no live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit=\r\n word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that =\r\nwe see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At the e=\r\nnd of the day, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech discha=\r\nrge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to peopl=\r\ne and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that =\r\nthere is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These =\r\nkarmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone to =\r\ncome and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You =\r\nare your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaa=\r\nsanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;If yo=\r\nu can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course, that i=\r\ns easier said than done.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Any moment when your mind becomes qu=\r\niet is a blessing.

We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksh=\r\na, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; what do this=\r\n items really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for=\r\n planets =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; do they bring forward good karmas or they create =\r\nnew ones?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well =\r\nknown in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;=\r\nIf we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that=\r\n point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, =\r\nthat he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if=\r\n this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode f=\r\nrom old memory].

The mental torture has become so severe that death =\r\nseems to be a blessings. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As per the theory, my suffering is caused =\r\nby my own karma. Perhaps, the karma from my previous life. I prayed to God.=\r\n I chanted mantra. Nothing seems to be working. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If my destiny is to=\r\n suffer, why should i pray to God? And if i am being punished for some kind=\r\n of bad karma from the past, why am i not aware of it? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is like g=\r\netting punishment without knowing your bad deeds. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the theory of =\r\nkarma is right, It is so illogical and so cruel to God for punishing me or =\r\npeople like me without telling the bad things done in the past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Plea=\r\nse correct me if i am wrong. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;,\n &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various ag=\r\nendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Puru=\r\nsha is the witness of it all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though each karm=\r\na should give karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *ag=\r\nent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a comp=\r\nlicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i=\r\n.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* =\r\nof karmaphalas and picking of agents for their\n delivery.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in=\r\n a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;prefer=\r\nably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third poo=\r\nl which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned an=\r\nd ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequ=\r\nencing of all beings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The assignment and order=\r\ning of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various =\r\nnew actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s lif=\r\ne, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may =\r\nchange and hence the pools may be re-arranged.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As one engages in r=\r\nemedial measures such as prayers,\n fasting, donations etc, one may transfor=\r\nm one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics w=\r\nith other beings (including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents=\r\n of delivery of karmaphala, who operate through other people who act as phy=\r\nsical agents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result.=\r\n Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down i=\r\nn order within the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to =\r\na higher pool or pushed up in order within the same pool.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;When someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behind =\r\nit (this is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arrangi=\r\nng karmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people aro=\r\nund one, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about =\r\nto give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaph=\r\nala anytime soon may be\n advanced sooner.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Howe=\r\nver, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma t=\r\nhat it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force,=\r\n but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can g=\r\nive a specific result, nobody can make one experience that result, no matte=\r\nr what ritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative ka=\r\nrmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive kar=\r\nmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessin=\r\ngs can often make some difference.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This point =\r\nis well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in hi=\r\ns point (3).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s =\r\nactions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show f=\r\navoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God=\r\n is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is t=\r\nhe power that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balance and o=\r\nrder within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her ey=\r\nes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administe=\r\nrs just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using available agents.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The karmas we committed in the past are alread=\r\ny in the pipeline and will give their results sooner or later. The best we =\r\ncan do with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. Th=\r\ne most important thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipelin=\r\ne now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to\n =\r\nothers are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure =\r\nor benefit to others are good karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When it =\r\ncomes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmapha=\r\nla, through conscious effort and current action, yes, it is possible and ge=\r\nneral guidelines are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about t=\r\nhe specific impact of each action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure=\r\n for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate with the karma itself.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You need only small force to push a cat out of your=\r\n way, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astro=\r\nlogy &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;___________________=\r\n_____________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymail=\r\nto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=82&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special eleph=\r\nant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king.

The beggar&#39;s\n karma made h=\r\nim a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick th=\r\ne king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick t=\r\nhe king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, an=\r\nd accept the result.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit wor=\r\nd &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath.

We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person are his=\r\n many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We t=\r\nhen want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pi=\r\npeline.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha\n teaches us that a =\r\n&#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are n=\r\nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your v=\r\naasanaas are your karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;If you can =\r\nchange your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma.
