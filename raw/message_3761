But she quenched her thirst unconcerned and then went on her way with\n&gt;=\r\n a roar. Ramana said astonished,=E2=80=9CWhy do you worry so much? The leop=\r\nard\n&gt; intimated to me by the first roar that she was coming here. After dri=\r\nnking\n&gt; water she told me by another roar that she was going. She went her =\r\nown way.She\n&gt; never meddled with your affairs. Why are you so scared? This =\r\nmountain is the\n&gt; home of these wild animals, and we are their guests. That=\r\n being so, is it\n&gt; right on your part to drive them away?=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Ram=\r\nana was equally fearless with regard to scorpions. Vasudeva Sastri\n&gt; recoun=\r\nts, =E2=80=9COne day, when we were at Skandashram, I was aghast to find a\n&gt;=\r\n scorpion climbing up over Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body in the front and another=\r\n at the\n&gt; same time climbing down his back. I was terrified and wanted to d=\r\no\n&gt; something. But Bhagavan remained calm, as if nothing happened, and the =\r\ntwo\n&gt; scorpions, after crawling over his body as if over a wall, eventually=\r\n left\n&gt; him. After they left,Bhagavan explained to us, =E2=80=98They crawl =\r\nover you just as\n&gt; they would crawl on the floor or a wall or tree. Do they=\r\n crawl over\n&gt; these,stinging as they go? It is only because you fear them a=\r\nnd do\n&gt; something,that they fear you and do something in return=E2=80=99.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; However, in so far as concerns insects which were a nuisance=\r\n to people, Sri\n&gt; Ramana did not object to killing them. When once a whole =\r\narmy of black ants\n&gt; invaded the Hall through the water drain,he told Annam=\r\nalai Swami to detect\n&gt; where they were coming from and to put an end to it.=\r\n The hole was cemented\n&gt; over without further ado. He also used to pluck bl=\r\nood-sucking insects out of\n&gt; the coats of the dogs and throw them into the =\r\ngleaming coals. Similarly he\n&gt; did not object if devotees killed mosquitoes=\r\n or used insecticide in the\n&gt; cowshed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maharshi had the same compassio=\r\nnate attitude towards plants as towards\n&gt; animals. One day workers had been=\r\n deputed to gather mangoes from one of the\n&gt; trees. But instead of climbing=\r\n up the tree and picking them one by one, they\n&gt; knocked them down with\n&gt; s=\r\nticks. In this way a large number of leaves were knocked down along with\n&gt; =\r\nthe fruit. Ramana, who was as usual sitting in the Hall,heard the beating\n&gt;=\r\n and sent a message via his attendants that it should stop at once. When he=\r\n\n&gt; later passed by the tree and saw the mango leaves in heaps on the floor,=\r\n he\n&gt; cried out harshly, =E2=80=9CIn return for giving us fruit, is the tre=\r\ne to be beaten\n&gt; with sticks? Who gave you this work? Instead of beating th=\r\ne tree, you might\n&gt; as well cut it to the roots. You need not gather the fr=\r\nuit. Go away!=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; When one of the attendants beat the monkeys, be=\r\ncause they had stolen nuts,\n&gt; Bhagavan rebuked him, =E2=80=9CYou are not be=\r\nating the monkeys, you are beating me.\n&gt; The pain is mine.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne monkeys often stole the fruit which devotees had brought as a food\n&gt; offe=\r\nring, if the latter were not careful or were meditating.One of the\n&gt; attend=\r\nants was entrusted with the task of receiving the fruit from the\n&gt; visitors=\r\n. One day he was sitting with eyes closed, a basket full of fruit at\n&gt; his =\r\nside, listening to the radio. In the mean\n&gt; time the monkeys were freely he=\r\nlping themselves to the contents of the\n&gt; basket. When people in the Hall t=\r\nried to chase the monkeys away, Ramana\n&gt; joked, =E2=80=9CWhen these attenda=\r\nnts are immersed in deep meditation, the monkeys\n&gt; come and see to the work=\r\n of the attendants. Someone has to look after the\n&gt; work! The attendants pu=\r\nt the fruit into the basket, the monkeys put the\n&gt; fruit into their stomach=\r\ns; that is all the difference. While people forget\n&gt; themselves while liste=\r\nning to the music over the radio the monkeys busy\n&gt; themselves in enjoying =\r\nthe sweet juice of the fruit. That is good, isn=E2=80=99t\n&gt; it!=E2=80=9D\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; The monkey mothers liked to come with their babies, to show them to Rama=\r\nna\n&gt; full of pride. Suri Nagamma reports, =E2=80=9CYesterday a monkey with =\r\nher baby stood\n&gt; in the window by the side of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s sofa. Bhag=\r\navan was reading something\n&gt; and so did not notice\n&gt; it. After a while, the=\r\n monkey screeched and one of the attendants tried to\n&gt; drive her away by sh=\r\nouting, but she would not go.Bhagavan then looked up and\n&gt; said, =E2=80=98W=\r\nait! She has come here to show her baby to Bhagavan; do not all the\n&gt; peopl=\r\ne bring their children to show them? For her, her child is equally\n&gt; dear. =\r\nLook how young that child is.=E2=80=99 So saying, Bhagavan turned towards h=\r\ner,\n&gt; and said in an endearing tone, =E2=80=98Hullo! So you have brought yo=\r\nur child? That\n&gt; is good!=E2=80=99 And, giving her a plantain, he sent her =\r\naway.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Ramana felt a deep admiration for the monkey tribes=\r\n and was convinced\n&gt; that tapas was not unknown to them. Once he said, =E2=\r\n=80=9CI have known something\n&gt; about their organisation, their kings, laws,=\r\nregulations. Everything is so\n&gt; perfect and well-organised. So much intelli=\r\ngence behind it all. I even know\n&gt; that tapas is not unknown to monkeys. A =\r\nmonkey whom we used to call\n&gt; =E2=80=98Mottaipaiyan=E2=80=99 was once oppre=\r\nssed and ill-treated by a gang. He went away\n&gt; into the forest for a few da=\r\nys, did tapas, acquired strength and returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; When he came and sat on=\r\n a bough and shook it, all the rest of the monkeys,\n&gt; who had previously il=\r\nl-treated him and of whom he was previously mortally\n&gt; afraid, were now qua=\r\nking before him. Yes, I am clear that tapas is well\n&gt; known to monkeys.=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; One day when Ramana inadvertently bumped against a sparrow=E2=\r\n=80=99s nest, an egg\n&gt; fell out and cracked. He was dismayed and cried out =\r\nto his attendant\n&gt; Madhava, =E2=80=9CLook, look what I have done today! Oh,=\r\nthe poor mother will be so\n&gt; sorrow-stricken, perhaps angry with me also, a=\r\nt my causing the destruction\n&gt; of her expected little one! Can the cracked =\r\neggshell be pieced together\n&gt; again? Let us try!=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; So saying he=\r\n took a piece of wet cloth, wrapped it around the broken egg and\n&gt; laid it =\r\nback into its nest. Each third hour he took it out again, removed\n&gt; the clo=\r\nth, took it in his hand and glanced at it for a few minutes. Seven\n&gt; days l=\r\nater, after taking the egg from its nest, he announced with the\n&gt; astonishm=\r\nent of a schoolboy, =E2=80=9CLook what a\n&gt; wonder! The crack has closed.=E2=\r\n=80=9D Some days later he found the egg hatched out,\n&gt; the little bird had =\r\ncome out. With a face beaming with joy he took the\n&gt; nestling into his hand=\r\n, stroked and caressed it and handed it to the others,\n&gt; that they could al=\r\nso admire it.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day some new born squirrels had fallen out of their =\r\nnest and landed on\n&gt; Ramana=E2=80=99s couch. Their eyes were still closed a=\r\nnd they were very tiny. The\n&gt; mother, however, did not take them back. But =\r\nhow should one feed such tiny\n&gt; things? The squirrels laid in Ramana=E2=80=\r\n=99s palm. His face was glowing with love\n&gt; and affection towards them. The=\r\n devotees looked on helplessly, but he was\n&gt; happy and cheerful. He asked f=\r\nor some cotton and made a soft bed for\n&gt; them.Then he took a piece of the c=\r\notton, rolled it up so that the end looked\n&gt; like a sharp needle, dipped it=\r\n into some milk and trickled it in their tiny\n&gt; mouths. This he did repeate=\r\ndly. He looked after them with great care and\n&gt; love until they grew up and=\r\n started running around. They did not run away,\n&gt; however, but always ran a=\r\nround their =E2=80=98mother=E2=80=99.\n&gt; \n&gt; Something similar happened, when=\r\n a cat ate the mother of some young\n&gt; squirrels. Again Ramana took on the t=\r\nask of caring for the young. As he\n&gt; liked to use daily events to teach his=\r\n devotees he said to them, =E2=80=9CThese\n&gt; little ones do not know that wi=\r\nsdom lies in remaining in their nest. They\n&gt; keep attempting to come out. A=\r\nll trouble lies outside but they cannot remain\n&gt; within. Similarly if the m=\r\nind is not externalised, but remains sunk in the\n&gt; Heart then there would o=\r\nnly be happiness. But the mind keeps moving out.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; When Rangaswami=\r\n asked, =E2=80=9CWhat is the path for keeping it inward?=E2=80=9D, Bhagavan=\r\n\n&gt; said, =E2=80=9CIt is exactly the same as what I am doing now. Each time =\r\na young\n&gt; squirrel comes out, I keep putting it back into its nest. When I =\r\ngo on doing\n&gt; it, it learns the happiness of staying in the nest.=E2=80=9D\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Shantamma reports, =E2=80=9COnce Lakshmi came into the Hall. She was p=\r\nregnant at\n&gt; that time. It was after lunch time, when Bhagavan was reading =\r\nthe\n&gt; newspapers. Lakshmi came near and started licking the papers. Bhagava=\r\nn\n&gt; looked up and said: =E2=80=98Wait a little, Lakshmi.=E2=80=99 But Laksh=\r\nmi went on licking.\n&gt; Bhagavan laid his paper aside, put his hands behind L=\r\nakshmi=E2=80=99s horns and his\n&gt; head against hers. Like this they stayed f=\r\nor quite a long time. I stood\n&gt; nearby looking at the wonderful scene. Afte=\r\nr some ten minutes or so,\n&gt; Bhagavan turned to me and said: =E2=80=98Do you=\r\n know what Lakshmi is doing? She is\n&gt; in\n&gt; samadhi.=E2=80=99 I looked at he=\r\nr and tears were flowing in streams down her broad\n&gt; cheeks. Her breathing =\r\nhad stopped and her eyes were fixed on Bhagavan. After\n&gt; some time Bhagavan=\r\n changed his position and asked: =E2=80=98Lakshmi, how do you feel\n&gt; now?=\r\n=E2=80=99 Lakshmi moved backwards, as if reluctant to turn her tail towards=\r\n\n&gt; Bhagavan,walked round the Hall and went out.=E2=80=9D\n&gt; \n&gt; Several dogs =\r\nlived in the Ashram. The most famous was Jackie,who was later\n&gt; buried in t=\r\nhe Ashram compound alongside the deer Valli and a crow. He did\n&gt; not much l=\r\nike playing and did not join the other dogs, but would sit in\n&gt; front of Sr=\r\ni Ramana, fixing his gaze on his eyes incessantly. He would also\n&gt; not star=\r\nt eating until Ramana had taken a mouthful of food. One day when a\n&gt; stray =\r\ndog entered the Ashram through the back door, Jackie started barking.\n&gt; Ram=\r\nana calmed him saying, =E2=80=9CYou just close your eyes. You just close yo=\r\nur\n&gt; eyes. You just close your eyes. If you do this you will not be able to=\r\n see\n&gt; the dog.=E2=80=9D At once Jackie closed his eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day Jacki=\r\ne was attacked by a ferocious pig and was seriously injured.\n&gt; His stomach =\r\nwas torn open and the intestines came out. It required a lot of\n&gt; stitches =\r\nto close it up and afterwards Jackie was carried to a mantapam\n&gt; opposite t=\r\nhe Ashram to recover. At the same time Kunju Swami was suffering\n&gt; from a s=\r\nevere abscess on his foot and was also staying in the same mantapam.\n&gt; When=\r\n Sri Ramana came to visit them, Kunju Swami was crying out in pain and\n&gt; fe=\r\nll at Maharshi=E2=80=99s feet. But Ramana said to him, =E2=80=9CSee, how Ja=\r\nckie is\n&gt; silently bearing his pain after such a major operation, without s=\r\no much as a\n&gt; whimper!=E2=80=9D This was helpful to Kunju Swami and his pai=\r\nn became bearable for\n&gt; him. Ramana stroked Jackie and enquired if the meal=\r\n had been brought and\n&gt; then left both patients.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: Ramana Mahars=\r\nhi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
