Nature puts some \nserious impediments to doing serious sadhana and realizing Self. Otherwise, \neveryone will realize Self very quickly. So, even one on the right path will \noccasionally start to wonder.\n\nEven Vivekananda and other disciples of Ramakrishna had doubts at various \nstages of their spiritual evolution. Especially after Ramakrishna left, \nseveral of them wanted to go back to their houses and lead &quot;regular lives&quot;. \nSome force kept them together. It was worthwhile at the end, because all of \nthem realized god. Actually, that is not the important thing - they were all \nelevated beings who had realized god before and bound to realize god again \nthat time too. What is more important is that each of them helped so many \nother people in making progress towards realization! *That* was why that \nwhole group came to earth after all.\n\nIf such elevated beings had doubts about so many things (is the guru \ngenuine, am I on the right path, can I succeed, is it worthwhile etc), what \nabout ordinary people like us?\n\nSo, expect the doubts to return now and then and put in your best conscious \neffort to overcome them!\n\nGood luck,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Somanath&quot; &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 16, 2009 6:23 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Overcoming objections to Homam and Chandi Paath?\n\n\n&gt; Namaste everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; Objections overruled! :) Thank you ever so much.\n&gt;\n&gt; I feel truly humbled and blessed that you have replied to my post and \n&gt; quelled my fears. I found the analogies very enlightening and I have \n&gt; reflected a lot upon your wise words of encouragement and I shall stop \n&gt; dilly-dallying asap.\n&gt;\n&gt; Aap sab ko koti koti dhanyawad.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Let me address the concerns about Kundalini.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (1) Do not associate Kundalini in your mind with any particular sadhana. \n&gt;&gt; Kundalini is awakened and rises if one is making pogress towards \n&gt;&gt; self-realization, no matter what path one follows and what sadhana one \n&gt;&gt; does. Whether one chants Chandipath or mahamantra or Vishnu sahasra naama \n&gt;&gt; or Gayatri or Ganapathi atharva seersha or an Islamic holy chant or a \n&gt;&gt; Christian holy chant or does no mantra but just engages in selfless \n&gt;&gt; service, does not matter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (2) Kundalini is the force of self-awareness. As one&#39;s false ideas of &quot;I \n&gt;&gt; am this&quot; get destroyed and one&#39;s self-awareness becomes refined, it \n&gt;&gt; translates to Kundalini awakening and rise.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (3) Certain practices (e.g. some tantras and some praanaayaamas) are \n&gt;&gt; normally associated with Kundalini. However, I can declare one thing very \n&gt;&gt; confidently. Most people engaged in those practices actually have no \n&gt;&gt; clue. As long as one has a firm notion &quot;I am this body. There is a \n&gt;&gt; Kundalini in this body. It will rise from point X in this body to point Y \n&gt;&gt; in this body now&quot;, one&#39;s self-awareness is firmly stuck to the body and \n&gt;&gt; one&#39;s Kundalini is sure to be fast asleep in Mooladhara. Kundalini \n&gt;&gt; spontaneously rises when one&#39;s body awareness goes. Consciously thinking \n&gt;&gt; of Kundalini rise is not required. As a matter of fact, it becomes a \n&gt;&gt; blockage and makes one cling on to body awareness. In other words, \n&gt;&gt; pre-occupation with Kundalini rise blocks Kundalini rise. Forget about \n&gt;&gt; Kundalini, forget about chakras, forget even about body. Focus on the \n&gt;&gt; mantra and deity and imagine that they alone exist and fill the entire \n&gt;&gt; universe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (4) Kundalini awakening is not something to be feared. Forget all that \n&gt;&gt; you may have read. Sat-chid-aananda described in scriptures is obtained \n&gt;&gt; when Kundalini is at sahasrara. Even low level aananda (bliss) that is \n&gt;&gt; experienced as Kundalini merely rises is far higher than any physical or \n&gt;&gt; mental pleasures one may have experienced when one&#39;s self-awareness is \n&gt;&gt; firmly rooted in one&#39;s body.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A prince once got a wrong idea that his father wanted to kill him. He ran \n&gt;&gt; away and hid in a dirty cave. When sunlight came into the cave, he was \n&gt;&gt; happy. When  the cave became dark, he was scared. He lived like that in \n&gt;&gt; the cave, happy sometimes and sad at others. He became so attached to the \n&gt;&gt; cave that he decided never to leave it. Also, he was afraid to get out of \n&gt;&gt; the cave lest he be killed. But his people were looking for him outside, \n&gt;&gt; because his father wanted to find his son and coronate him as the king. \n&gt;&gt; But, the prince rotted in the cave unaware of this and afraid of going \n&gt;&gt; out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A person&#39;s attachment to body and fear of self-realization is just like \n&gt;&gt; the above. Body is like the dirty cave. Self-realization is like getting \n&gt;&gt; out of the cave and becoming king.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting the Paath with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; these motives in mind?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Chanting a mantra without being tempted by any desires ever is the best. \n&gt;&gt; But, chanting a mantra and falling to some desires now and then is still \n&gt;&gt; better than not doing any sadhana. It is not like your desires will leave \n&gt;&gt; you automatically if you do not do any sadhana. As sadhana progresses, \n&gt;&gt; one *slowly* overcomes weaknesses and desires. The debit from any \n&gt;&gt; offenses committed in sadhana due to the few desires left are smaller \n&gt;&gt; than the credit from doing the sadhana.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One may be putting salary money in the bank every month, but some of it \n&gt;&gt; may be being deduced for paying bills (mortgage, phone, cable, groceries \n&gt;&gt; etc). Still, going to work everyday and putting the salary money in the \n&gt;&gt; bank account is better than not working.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I am\n&gt;&gt; &gt; prepared to disregard the superstitions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are many misconceptions about every spiritual matter in today&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; world. After all, this is Kali yuga and we have been through a \n&gt;&gt; particularly a dark phase. Just as undigested food becomes toxic, \n&gt;&gt; undigested and unassimilated knowledge leads to corruptions and \n&gt;&gt; superstitions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you hear a call from inside, do respond to it fearlessly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ---- waspieswaspies &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste all,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I thought that there was no better place to ask this question since \n&gt;&gt; &gt; this is the yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandi Homam along with Shri Narasimhaji&#39;s words. My desire to praise \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the Divine Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that we are coming close to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am \n&gt;&gt; &gt; plannig to start with the recitation first so that I am up to scratch \n&gt;&gt; &gt; when I start doing the homam. (Learning to walk before learning to run) \n&gt;&gt; &gt; :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if you had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams \n&gt;&gt; &gt; regularly. Please kindly share how you have managed? My dilemmas are \n&gt;&gt; &gt; two-fold. Firstly, I encounter objections from outside from fellow \n&gt;&gt; &gt; friends and family members who say that &quot;the Chandi homam isn&#39;t part of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the family tradition&quot; hence the family devta won&#39;t be pleased or \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;un-initiated people cannot perform such a high level ritual&quot; or even \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;un-married people cannot get married if they do this on a regularly \n&gt;&gt; &gt; basis&quot;! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I am \n&gt;&gt; &gt; prepared to disregard the superstitions.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What I find harder to discard though, are personal objections that I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; create for myself..I call it the &quot;I-am-not-worthy-enough&quot; syndrome. I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; am not confident of being able to stay completely detached during the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; homam. I think what I am trying to say is that I do not know to what \n&gt;&gt; &gt; extent my underlying motives can remain pure (unselfish) enough. At \n&gt;&gt; &gt; some point or another won&#39;t one end up automatically asking for one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; &gt; personal gains? After all, isn&#39;t it human nature to confide \n&gt;&gt; &gt; everything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; please give my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that case, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to &#39;white-wash&#39; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s selfish motives?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Secondly, I have to admit that after listening to some tales about \n&gt;&gt; &gt; regular recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with &#39;Kundalini \n&gt;&gt; &gt; jagran&#39;, I am a bit worried. Can sadhana and &#39;kundalini jagran&#39; ever be \n&gt;&gt; &gt; mutually exclusive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying \n&gt;&gt; &gt; only? Do they still have to undergo chakra awakening etc?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thank u.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Somanathan\n\n\n"}}
