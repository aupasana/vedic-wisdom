What you wrote is well-t=\r\naken.\n \n&gt; That is why chastity and bramacarya has always been\n&gt; considered =\r\nthe highest virtue. No YOga can happen without chastity.\n \nThat is absolute=\r\nly correct. Brahmacharya and control of one&#39;s sexual thoughts is quite need=\r\ned to make spiritual progress.\n \nIf anybody maintains brahmacharya for one =\r\nyear while performing a 45 minute homam everyday or meditating with Gayatri=\r\n mantra (or some other mantra) for 3 hours everyday, definitely he/she will=\r\n cross some important hurdles and make some good progress.\n \n&gt; It is clear =\r\nwhy it is even more important for women to be chaste and\n&gt; pious considerin=\r\ng the strength of Moon and Venus in her body-gross and\n&gt; causal.\n \nChastity=\r\n and brahmacharya are *equally important* for men and women to make spiritu=\r\nal progress. But the level of difficulty one experiences in controlling the=\r\n mind depends on various factors such as gender and, more importantly, ment=\r\nal conditioning acquired from previous lives.\n \n&gt; At least, Somannath dreka=\r\nna should be checked for the period of poojas\n&gt; to see how the dasas suppor=\r\nt celibacy vow that is usually required in\n&gt; the cases of sadhanas whose ai=\r\nm is spiritual elevation. \n \nWell, two relevant points:\n \n(1) The astrology=\r\n we know and understand is imperfect without a doubt. Even knowledge taught=\r\n unambiguously by Maharshi Parasara is so misunderstood in this age. Then w=\r\nhat to speak of knowledge not found in the available teachings of Parasara =\r\nand available in the &quot;secrets&quot; of various paramparas? It is quite prone to =\r\ncorruptions and misunderstanding. Can we *rely* on it?\n \n(2) Astrology, eve=\r\nn when understood perfectly, only predicts the predisposition at a given ti=\r\nme due to the dynamics of *previous* actions (karmas). The dynamics of prev=\r\nious actions decides under what kind of circumstances one has to operate no=\r\nw. Those circumstances can place *limitations* on what actions can be perfo=\r\nrmed *now*. Depending on the seriousness of previous actions deciding the c=\r\nurrent circumstances, the limitations can be either mere challenges or seri=\r\nous handicaps. But, in most cases, there are multiple actions possible curr=\r\nently. Horoscope only decides the situations faced now. The actions perform=\r\ned *now* are based on *free will* exerted now, which is NOT captured by the=\r\n horoscope.\n \nIf there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual pr=\r\nogress is definitely *the* thing. One should push one&#39;s free will to the ex=\r\ntreme when it comes to spiritual progress. It is worth it! Forget somanatha=\r\n drekkana and other tenets of astrology. When the inspiration comes from wi=\r\nthin, just boldly take a vow, pray to god and your guru (if you have no gur=\r\nu, think of me or my Guru Dr Manish Pandit) and do your best to keep the vo=\r\nw.\n \n*        *        *\n \nEven if one cannot keep brahmacharya, one can st=\r\nill do spiritual practices like homam and japam. It will atleast keep one f=\r\nloating (i.e. not sinking). Basically, one will keep accumulating shakti (p=\r\nurity) and keep consuming it. So purification is slow. But atleast there is=\r\n no further impurification. With brahmacharya, one can actually start accum=\r\nulating shakti and purify oneself much faster.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRega=\r\nrding women doing sadhanas:\n \nA great Vedic scholar known as Upasani mahara=\r\nj lived at the time of Shirdi Sai Baba, about 100 years back. He was learne=\r\nd in several Vedas and Upanishads and did tremendous sadhana. Once he reali=\r\nzed Self, he threw away his orthodoxy and went against the customs of the t=\r\nime boldly. He went and lived in Harijanwada (untouchables colony), swept t=\r\nhe floors there and forced the Brahmins from Brahmanawada (Brahmins colony)=\r\n who revered him highly to come *there* if they wanted to see him! He opene=\r\nd a Vedic school for women and taught them chanting Vedic mantras and perfo=\r\nrming traditional yajnas. He gave women of all births sacred thread and ini=\r\ntiated them into vedic mantras and yajnas.\n \nWhen Shridi Sai Baba saw him o=\r\nneday, he said &quot;Upasani is God Himself. Today we will do pooja to Upasani!&quot;=\r\n and made his disciples do a pooja to Upasani maharaj.\n \nA temple run by wo=\r\nmen stands in the place of Upasani maharaj, a few miles away from Shirdi. I=\r\nf anyone goes to Shirdi, it is a good idea to go to that temple. Though it =\r\nhas no rush, it has very nice energy. It is a great place to meditate.\n \nAl=\r\nso, Krishna temple at Alandi near Pune where Sant Jnaneshwar Maharaj went i=\r\nnto underground samadhi 700 years back (believed to be there even now) has =\r\na tremendous level of spiritual energy. It is also a great place for produc=\r\ntive meditation.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC=\r\n) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------ \n \n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tijana D=\r\namjanovic&quot; &lt;tijanadamjanovic@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; om krishna guru\n&gt; Dear Ana and=\r\n other members of the thread,\n&gt; \n&gt; Difference exists and it makes the world=\r\n go round, which is perfectly\n&gt; fine. After it is understood properly, no p=\r\nots and pans will be needed\n&gt; to define anyones role or place under the sun=\r\n...that shines the same\n&gt; to one and all. :)\n&gt; Shrimad Devi Bhagavatam (one=\r\n of the Upapuranas) states that sexual\n&gt; urge is much stronger in the case =\r\nof women. This is not surprising as\n&gt; sexual urge is produced and governed =\r\nby the liquid fluctuation in the\n&gt; body (watter, blood, semen and hormones =\r\nin the first place). This\n&gt; fluctuation is much higher in woman`s body due =\r\nto the predominance of\n&gt; jala tatva in her body governed by planets Moon an=\r\nd Venus. These two\n&gt; planets are also responsible for the producing of the =\r\nojas (the\n&gt; finniest energetic product of our body that makes the brain fun=\r\nction\n&gt; properly, it is often understood as a vigor, vitality and procreati=\r\nve\n&gt; power). In general, this means that women can produce more ojas than m=\r\nan.\n&gt; How is this related to poojas and spirituality?\n&gt; Sexual energy, or s=\r\nexual thoughts, are being transformed into ojas in\n&gt; the process of yoga. T=\r\nhe process of yoga as one of its aim has lifting\n&gt; of the ojas from its sto=\r\nrage in the primal chakra and its storing in\n&gt; the brain. The more ojas in =\r\nthe brain the prettier, smarter and more\n&gt; spiritual we are. But this lifti=\r\nng of the ojas can be done ONLY by\n&gt; chaste ones. That is why chastity and =\r\nbramacarya has always been\n&gt; considered the highest virtue. No YOga can hap=\r\npen without chastity. It\n&gt; is clear why it is even more important for women=\r\n to be chaste and\n&gt; pious considering the strength of Moon and Venus in her=\r\n body-gross and\n&gt; causal.\n&gt; Without chastity, yogic pratice can lead into a=\r\n mental disorder as\n&gt; ojas and prana directly influence the work of the bra=\r\nin centres. Thus\n&gt; it is crucial how demanding and serious the homam or poo=\r\nja in\n&gt; question, or any other, is. Prohibition during the monthly cycle is=\r\n\n&gt; based upon this also-increasing of the jala tatva and the sexual urge.\n&gt;=\r\n At least, Somannath drekana should be checked for the period of poojas\n&gt; t=\r\no see how the dasas support celibacy vow that is usually required in\n&gt; the =\r\ncases of sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. \n&gt; The approaches to th=\r\ne final truth may be numerous and different, but\n&gt; all of them must find th=\r\neir path through the Sushumna. The one who\n&gt; claims that this path is hidde=\r\nn or blocked to women simply lacks ojas\n&gt; in his/her brain.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ti=\r\njana Damjanovic\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S.

This is not \nsurprising as&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; sexual urge is produced and governed by the liquid \nfluctuation in the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; body (watter, blood, semen and hormones in the first \nplace). This&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; fluctuation is much higher in woman`s body due to the \npredominance=\r\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; jala tatva in her body governed by planets Moon and \nVenus. The=\r\nse two&lt;BR&gt;&gt; planets are also responsible for the producing of the \nojas =\r\n(the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; finniest energetic product of our body that makes the brain \nf=\r\nunction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; properly, it is often understood as a vigor, vitality and \n=\r\nprocreative&lt;BR&gt;&gt; power). In general, this means that women can produce m=\r\nore \nojas than man.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; How is this related to poojas and spirituality?=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSexual energy, or sexual thoughts, are being transformed into oja=\r\ns in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nthe process of yoga. The process of yoga as one of its aim ha=\r\ns lifting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nof the ojas from its storage in the primal chakra and it=\r\ns storing in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \nbrain. The more ojas in the brain the prettier, s=\r\nmarter and more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nspiritual we are. But this lifting of the ojas can=\r\n be done ONLY by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nchaste ones. That is why chastity and bramacarya =\r\nhas always been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nconsidered the highest virtue. No YOga can happen =\r\nwithout chastity. It&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nis clear why it is even more important for wo=\r\nmen to be chaste and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pious \nconsidering the strength of Moon and Ve=\r\nnus in her body-gross and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \ncausal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Without chastity, yogic =\r\npratice can lead into a mental disorder \nas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ojas and prana directly=\r\n influence the work of the brain centres. \nThus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it is crucial how d=\r\nemanding and serious the homam or pooja \nin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; question, or any other,=\r\n is. Prohibition during the monthly cycle \nis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; based upon this also-=\r\nincreasing of the jala tatva and the sexual \nurge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At least, Somann=\r\nath drekana should be checked for the period of \npoojas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to see how =\r\nthe dasas support celibacy vow that is usually \nrequired in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the cas=\r\nes of sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The approaches t=\r\no the final truth may be numerous and different, \nbut&lt;BR&gt;&gt; all of them m=\r\nust find their path through the Sushumna. The one \nwho&lt;BR&gt;&gt; claims that =\r\nthis path is hidden or blocked to women simply lacks \nojas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in his/h=\r\ner brain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tijana \nDamjanovic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; P.S.=\r\n Ana, odakle si?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0304_01C904A0.26ED1580--\r\n\n"}}
