My Parents visited Mahaakaal last &lt;br&gt;year. &lt;br&gt;&gt; it is also said that, the main attraction of Mahaakaal is to &lt;br&gt;attend &lt;br&gt;&gt;\n their early mroning Bhasma Aarati. and people told me\n that it is a &lt;br&gt;&gt; custom to bring the ashes of last cremated body from the nearby &lt;br&gt;&gt; smashaan for the Bhasma Abhiskek. by the way it is well known that &lt;br&gt;&gt; Amitabh Bachhan has a turn around in his career after rirual &lt;br&gt;&gt; performed at Mahaakaleshwar. KBK thing happened and came out from &lt;br&gt;&gt; debt etc..&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ujjain was once the capital of great king Vikramaaditya. Gujarati &lt;br&gt;&gt; calander year, which is Vikram Samvat is also named after him. so &lt;br&gt;&gt; gujaraatis have connection to Ujjain:)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I am not sure but is Raja Bhartuhari considered as one of the &lt;br&gt;&gt; Chiranjivis? and was under the impression that the name of his &lt;br&gt;&gt; treaty was Vairaagya Shataka.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; but not much important. how much information we&#39;ll store in this &lt;br&gt;&gt; memory and what we will do with that.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; warm regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; utpal &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;\n ymailto=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, Amit Trivedi &lt;sonat64@&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaskaaram Miteshji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the interesting info.on Ujjain&#39;s surroundings.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As you have mentioned the most famous place here is the &lt;br&gt;&gt; Jyotirlinga of&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagwan Mahaakaleshwar and equally vibrant place &lt;br&gt;is &lt;br&gt;&gt; Shakti sthaana of Maa Harasiddhi Devi.Incidentally, Maa &lt;br&gt;&gt; Harasiddhi&nbsp;has another Seat for Raatrivaas or nightstay near &lt;br&gt;&gt; Porbandar -Gujarat.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Raaja Bhartruhari is the revered creator of two immortal &lt;br&gt;&gt; classics : Nitishataka and Shringarashataka- his life is a message &lt;br&gt;to &lt;br&gt;&gt; all people&nbsp;to understand&nbsp;the redundance of the mundane &lt;br&gt;wealth,beauty &lt;br&gt;&gt; and affection. He first created &#39;Shringaara shataka&#39;\n &lt;br&gt;describing&nbsp;how &lt;br&gt;&gt; the richly endowed people\n should enjoy life.... the Kaalachakra &lt;br&gt;&gt; turned a full cycle and he was short-changed by his beloved -Raani &lt;br&gt;&gt; Pingala.The mighty king takes to the ascetic life&nbsp;and at the&nbsp;peak &lt;br&gt;of &lt;br&gt;&gt; self-realization- he created another everlasting creation-&#39; Niti &lt;br&gt;&gt; shataka&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;.... Strange are the ways of Almighty !!! The&nbsp;scholar of &lt;br&gt;&gt; Shringaara (read Bhogi) turns the scholar of Niti (roughly &lt;br&gt;&gt; putting:Systems as in particle physics definition).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Some people believe that Sage Bhartruhari is still roaming in &lt;br&gt;&gt; India and grants Darshan to few lucky saadhakas.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Humble Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; amit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 2/26/09, m540i98 &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; From: m540i98 &lt;m540i98@&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Region of Ujjain&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;\n ymailto=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, February 26, 2009, 8:42 PM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The region around Ujjain is considered the heart of spiritaul &lt;br&gt;&gt; india.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; A lot of Mahatmaas in Sookma Sareer stay in that Malwa Region &lt;br&gt;and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; river Chambal.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Please pardon my spellings.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Amongst the famous Harisiddhi Mata Temple one of the Shakti &lt;br&gt;Peets &lt;br&gt;&gt; and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ShivLinga Temples. Ujjain is also famous for Raja Bharathat Hari &lt;br&gt;&gt; cave.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Raja Barathari is considered as one of the 9 Naths from the Nath &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sampradaya. He meditated for a long time and then he went south &lt;br&gt;to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Devas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop of blood &lt;br&gt;&gt; from\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sati when Lord Shiva was\n carrying the corpse feel in Devas too. &lt;br&gt;&gt; And &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; in the same place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A &lt;br&gt;lot &lt;br&gt;&gt; of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; great Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating &lt;br&gt;there, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; starting with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai &lt;br&gt;and &lt;br&gt;&gt; then&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sheelnath Maharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; century. Over and above the temple now there is Sheelnath &lt;br&gt;maharaj &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dhuni Sanstan and also Swami VishnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s Ashram &lt;br&gt;located &lt;br&gt;&gt; in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the valley of the hill where Mother Chamunda temple is situated.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mother in this temple manifested many times and gave guidance &lt;br&gt;and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there are others &lt;br&gt;who &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; benefited too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; They all stayed at the Temple in devas. It is said even today\n &lt;br&gt;many &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mahatmas in Sooksma sareer come to pray Chamunda Devi on a &lt;br&gt;regular &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; basis.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mitesh&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
