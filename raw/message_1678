Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some intelligent and rational people wonder why we n=\r\need to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I want to exp=\r\nlain this basic point with an analogy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We teach some phrases and mann=\r\ners to small children. For example, we tell small children to say &quot;thank yo=\r\nu&quot; when someone helps or say &quot;I am sorry&quot; when they do something wrong. A r=\r\neally small child does not even understand what those words mean, but repea=\r\nts them out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to understand the t=\r\nrue meaning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding of what =\r\nthey truly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are actually u=\r\nnderstood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or the picture=\r\n of a mango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As =\r\na child accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions of the ex=\r\nternal world through senses), the child&#39;s thinking expands and one gets mor=\r\ne clarity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says =\r\nsorry, one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even feel a c=\r\nertain emotion (sadness and compassion).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, one may be doing =\r\nrituals like homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without ful=\r\nly understanding or appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many=\r\n years without fully understanding its real meaning may slowly start to und=\r\nerstand and even experience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many ma=\r\nntras and spiritual truths are actually understood from experience alone. O=\r\nne can never fully understand what one has never experienced. As we accumul=\r\nate more experiences (stored perceptions of the external and internal world=\r\n through external senses and the inward directed mind), one&#39;s thinking expa=\r\nnds and one gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual truths one has =\r\nbeen exposed to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rituals in various religions are designed to symbliz=\r\ne some truths that gives bliss when experienced by one. A mere explanation =\r\nof the symbolism is often useless to give one that state of bliss. Even if =\r\nyou explain to a one year old child what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means in detail, =\r\nthe child will not understand. The best thing to do is to just get the chil=\r\nd into the habit of saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; in approapriate situations. Slowly,=\r\n the meaning will become clearer and clearer with experience and the correc=\r\nt emotions will come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyd=\r\nay - possibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and visualizati=\r\non in the mind - will slowly understand it and experience it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some re=\r\nligions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing phi=\r\nlosophy and the final truths. While the latter is undeniably the end goal, =\r\nthe former helps one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs to set foo=\r\nt at the base of hill before reaching its top, one often needs to engage in=\r\n some external practices in order to realize internal truths. Of course, it=\r\n is good to remind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest one should g=\r\net stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one cannot completely eliminate=\r\n the first steps. Just saying &quot;you are That. Just realize that you are That=\r\n&quot; is not an action plan. It does not work for most. One has to take some ba=\r\nby steps.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If we don&#39;t teach a toddler to say various words because th=\r\ne toddler does not anyway understand them, one will never learn anything. C=\r\norrect knowledge evolves from half knowledge and habits that may be devoid =\r\nof knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Similarly, correct s=\r\npiritual knowledge evolves from half knowledge and ritualalistic practices =\r\nthat may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. M=\r\nost of us, when it comes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers. So it is=\r\n useful to get into the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish so=\r\nftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJ=\r\nC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
