Actually books were written in telugu. \nIf you have =\r\ntime and you are in India, please don&#39;t miss these great \njnanis. As I didn=\r\n&#39;t go to India recently, I haven&#39;t yet met these great \nliving yogis. Remem=\r\nber, Nowadays, it is very difficult to see a living \njnani. So please don&#39;t=\r\n miss the opportunity to visit them.\n\nI read a story from dhuniwala dada&#39;s =\r\nlife in one of the books I \ncouldn&#39;t recall. \nOnce a old lady begger came t=\r\no Dhuniwala&#39;s ashram. Then dada send her \nout with so much anger and hate. =\r\nHis pupil asked him why he was very \nangry on her. Then dada told them that=\r\n she killed a saint in her past \nlife. So she has to has 7 more lifes(incar=\r\nnations) like that. Just \nbecause she visited the ashram, some of her sins =\r\nwere burnt, and 6 more \nlifes would be enough to burn her sins.\n\n\nVisiting =\r\nliving saints is a great opportunity. They never care about \nanything in th=\r\ne earth and don&#39;t judge them by their appearance too.  \n \nWebsite:\nhttp://w=\r\nww.saimastersevatrust.org/livingsaints.html\n\n\n\n\n"}}
