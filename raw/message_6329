This helps me daily to fill my mind with glor=\r\nies and story of Narayan. I read the english meaning before puja and it foc=\r\nuses my heart and soul. \n\nIt has 100 chapters, each of which is 10shlokas w=\r\nhcih is summary of 1 chapter of Bhagawat puran. if you read 1/2 story daily=\r\n, it will give new material daily for 100/50 days. Atleast my mind gets fil=\r\nled with joy daily to know new story about narayan daily and my daily puja =\r\ngets new motivation.\n\nYou can read more on wikipedia or google it.\n\n\nYou ca=\r\nn buy\n1.
