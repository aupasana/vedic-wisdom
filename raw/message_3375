It is a significant step in on=\r\ne&#39;s spiritual evolution, but still not the ultimate.&quot; - Sadhguru\n\nThere are=\r\n various types of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadhis have be=\r\nen classified into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been broadly cate=\r\ngorized as savikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or qualities =\r\nand samadhis without attributes or qualities. \n\nWe see with Isha Yoga, peop=\r\nle go into different types of samadhis. Here it is common to witness both s=\r\navikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain state of equanimity whe=\r\nre the intellect goes beyond its normal function of discrimination. This, i=\r\nn turn, loosens one from his physical body. In samadhi states, one becomes =\r\nloose inside the body or there is a space between what is you and your body=\r\n. These samadhis, by themselves have no great significance in terms of Real=\r\nization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, does not mean you are rele=\r\nased from Existence. It is just a new level of experience. \n\nIt is like whe=\r\nn you were a child, you had one level of experience, once you moved into yo=\r\nur adulthood, you have another level of experience. The same things that yo=\r\nu have experienced at a particular point in your life, after a few years, y=\r\nou experience them in a totally different way. So, you have moved from one =\r\nlevel of experience to another level of experience. \n\nSamadhis are just lik=\r\ne this. You are moving from one level of experience to another level of exp=\r\nerience in a much more significant and deeper sense. Still, it is just anot=\r\nher level of experience.\n\nSomebody may go into a certain level of samadhi a=\r\nnd stay there for years because it is enjoyable. There is no space or time.=\r\n There are no bodily problems. He has broken the physical and psychological=\r\n barriers to some extent. But this is only temporary. The moment he comes o=\r\nut, again he gets hungry, he has to sleep, and again everything comes back.=\r\n \n\nSamadhi definitely has its benefits. There are many things it has to off=\r\ner for an individual, but this doesn&#39;t really take you closer to Realizatio=\r\nn, as such. Compared to a man who is sober, a man who is slightly drunk, ha=\r\ns a different level of experience, but he has to come down at some point. A=\r\nll samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high without any external ch=\r\nemicals. Now, by going into these states, it opens up a new dimension for y=\r\nou, but it doesn&#39;t leave any great transformation behind. It doesn&#39;t leave =\r\nyou permanently transformed. \n\nYou have not moved into another reality. In =\r\nthe same reality, your level of experiences has deepened. You have experien=\r\nced the same things in a little deeper sense. You have not become free from=\r\n the mind. \n\nNow, somebody meditates for 12 years and comes out. Even after=\r\n 12 years, he may not be a realized being, but, maybe he is a little closer=\r\n. When you go into another reality and stay there for long hours or long ye=\r\nars, the grip of this reality is broken on you. Now, you have come to an ex=\r\nperiential understanding that, this is not it. Not just an intellectual und=\r\nerstanding, you have seen experientially that this is not it. That is the w=\r\nhole purpose of long meditations. But most realized beings never went into =\r\nsamadhi states. \n\nGautama never sat for 12 years in one place. Many of his =\r\ndisciples, many Buddhist monks went into very long meditations. They never =\r\ncame out for years, but Gautama himself never went, because he saw it is no=\r\nt necessary. \n\nHe practiced and experienced all the eight kinds of samadhis=\r\n before his enlightenment and he discarded them. He said, &quot;This is not it&quot;.=\r\n This is not going to take you any closer to realization. It is just moving=\r\n into a higher level of experience and probably you will get more caught up=\r\n, because it is more beautiful than the current reality. \n\nIf the goal is s=\r\net, if you&#39;ve made realization the top priority in your life, then every th=\r\ning else which doesn&#39;t take you one step closer is meaningless. Let&#39;s say y=\r\nou are climbing the Mount Everest, you will not take one step sideways, bec=\r\nause every ounce of energy is needed. Now, if you have to transcend your ow=\r\nn consciousness, you need every ounce of what you have and it&#39;s not enough.=\r\n So, any action that we perform, we don&#39;t want it to be a sidewinder.\n\nWe h=\r\nave created powerful consecrated spaces where experiencing samadhi states c=\r\nomes very naturally. There are samadhis that are very pleasant, blissful, a=\r\nnd ecstatic and there are samadhis that are beyond this. Those who go into =\r\nsamadhi states beyond pleasant or unpleasant, or nirvikalpa, we always keep=\r\n them in protected states as their contact with the body has become very mi=\r\nnimal. The smallest disturbance, like a sound or a pinprick would dislodge =\r\nthem from their body. These states are maintained for certain periods to es=\r\ntablish the distinction between you and the body. It is a significant step =\r\nin one&#39;s spiritual evolution, but still not the Ultimate.\n \n\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nam=\r\naste,\n&gt; \n&gt; [&quot;When I am in Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience.

Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being where th=\r\nere\n&gt; is no &quot;experiencer&quot;, nothing &quot;to experience&quot; and also no act of\n&gt; &quot;ex=\r\nperiencing&quot;.

If there is no observation and\n&gt; experience, how can you descri=\r\nbe Nirvikalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that there is nothing to d=\r\nescribe in Nirvikalpa samadhi.\n&gt; Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once =\r\nsaid to me: &quot;When I am in\n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience.

One may think &quot;=\r\nnothing\n&gt; really exists apart from Brahman - all this I am perceiving is a\n=\r\n&gt; delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive is actually Brahman&quot;.\n&gt; Anot=\r\nher may think &quot;all that I perceive is actually a minute part of\n&gt; Krishna&quot;.=\r\n And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness on a specific\n&gt; thought and ev=\r\nerything else disappears from the mind, one is in samadhi.\n&gt; Once that I-ne=\r\nss also disappears, one is in Nirvikalpa samadhi. However,\n&gt; one can only d=\r\nescribe the last thought on which I-ness was focused prior\n&gt; to Nirvikalpa =\r\nsamadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa samadhi itself.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Some yogis prefe=\r\nr the stage just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a\n&gt; trace of I-ness is lef=\r\nt in an intense focus on one thought, to\n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi itself. In th=\r\ne former, there is an experience and\n&gt; bliss - some rasa (juice).

Now I see=\r\n this line in different ways - 1) As different saints\n&gt; have mentioned diff=\r\nerent sadhanas/paths to achieve God. 2) Secondly as\n&gt; you mentioned, that T=\r\nruth is One, but saints call it differently.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; From=C2 from the d=\r\niamond analogy I understand that if=C2 X reaches a\n&gt; certain face of the di=\r\namond and Y reaches another face of the diamond,\n&gt; they percieve it differe=\r\nntly, thought both faces are the same diamond,\n&gt; just different aspects.

The\n&gt; experiencer,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; experienced and experience all merge into one.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; 1) This seems=\r\n logical and is also the main cause of my confusion.\n&gt; When=C2 we say that =\r\nwe enter the middle of the diamond, when duality is\n&gt; no more, then how can=\r\n it=C2 be experienced differently by different\n&gt; people? Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2=\r\n  the same? I thought, whichever face of teh\n&gt; diamond you chose as your en=\r\ntry point, the middle of teh diamond should\n&gt; feel and look exactly similar=\r\n. Please correct me if I am wrong in my\n&gt; understanding.=C2 =C2 And yet the=\r\nse three spiritual gaints have spoken\n&gt; differently of their realizations. =\r\nIf duality itself does not exist,\n&gt; then how can the field of possiblity at=\r\n all arise? Which means, how can\n&gt; there be a difference in the &quot;perception=\r\n&quot; of the same One final Truth?\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; 2) Not to mention the query abou=\r\nt whether, that which is\n&gt; transcendental in its basic nature (Truth/One/Mi=\r\nddle of the\n&gt; diamond),=C2 can=C2 at all be=C2 described from within the fi=\r\neld of\n&gt; duality? Then I wonder why these three people - saints of highest =\r\norder\n&gt; - try to describe it when all descriptions are from within duality.=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Considering the above, I understand the wisdom (theoriticall=\r\ny) of why\n&gt; Ramakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I also wonder whether=C2 the three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri\n&gt; =\r\nAurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking from teh same realization of=C2\n&gt; t=\r\nhe One/Truth, or was it different kinds of realizations.
