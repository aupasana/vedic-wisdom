I did not get the same impression at\n&gt; the famous Kalighat temple=\r\n which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu th=\r\nat I was taken to by a priest\n&gt; who took me to visit about 30 temples all o=\r\nver Tamil Nadu before we did the\n&gt; Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I=\r\n never heard of that temple before\n&gt; and it seemed like a small temple. The=\r\n name of the form of the divine\n&gt; Mother present there was a Tamil language=\r\n name and I did not understand it.\n&gt; I do not even remember the name now.
