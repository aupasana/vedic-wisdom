Hence,\n=\r\nteaching by silence is the highest there is. In this way alone does the\nasp=\r\nirant=E2=80=99s mind obtain peace.\n\nThere is the question about initiation.=\r\n What is true initiation?\n\n538 It is said that initiation is of three forms=\r\n, namely, looking, thinking\nand touching with the hand. But the highest ini=\r\ntiation consists of the Guru\nremaining in the supreme silence. So says our =\r\nGuru.\n\nThe supreme state is called silence.\n\n539 Because that state is taug=\r\nht by silence, and also because it is attained\nby remaining in silence, it =\r\nis called silence. The sage is in silence\nalways, even when he speaks.\n\nThe=\r\n last statement is difficult to understand. It will be better understood\nwh=\r\nen Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching about the natural state (sahaja samadhi) is\n=\r\nexplained.\nThis enlightenment is the subject of many questions. One of thes=\r\ne is, =E2=80=98Will\nit remain permanent, or will it be lost later?=E2=80=99=\r\n\n\n540 That eternal state is ever shining by the light of the sun of\nconscio=\r\nusness, the real Self. After realising it, there is no possibility of\nswerv=\r\ning from that natural state of the Self due to forgetfulness.\n\nThe reason i=\r\ns that when right awareness dawns by following the direct path,\nthe ego and=\r\n mind merge and are once and for all lost in that Self. It is\notherwise whe=\r\nn some sort of bliss is experienced as a result of yoga. Yoga\nby itself doe=\r\ns not lead up to egolessness.\n\nDoes the world survive after the egolessness=\r\n is established?\n\n541 The statement of the vedantic text that the Self swal=\r\nlows up the moving\nand the unmoving, means that the world, which is only da=\r\nrkness, is consumed\nby the effulgence of that Self.\n\nThe Upanishads thus cl=\r\nearly state that the world, being only darkness,\ncannot possibly survive in=\r\n the presence of the light of right awareness.\n\nThe very same truth has bee=\r\nn expressed by Bhagavan in the first verse of his\nArunachala Pancharatnam, =\r\nwhich is paraphrased here.\n\n542 The essential nature of the Self has been s=\r\nung by Guru Bhagavan in the\nfollowing words: =E2=80=98The Supreme Self, nam=\r\ned Arunachalesa [The Lord of\nArunachala], shines alone without a second, ha=\r\nving swallowed this\nsolid-seeming universe by his own consciousness-light.=\r\n=E2=80=99\n\nThis confirms the statement that creation is composed of darknes=\r\ns\n(ignorance) alone, and has no substantial reality even now, when ignoranc=\r\ne\nand ego are rampant.\n\nAn inaccuracy of statement that is unavoidably made=\r\n is corrected.\n\n543 The statement that the Self, by attaining oneness with =\r\nBrahman, becomes\nfreed from the bondage of samsara is not true, because the=\r\n Self never fell\nfrom its true state.\n\n544 Just as white cloth does not acq=\r\nuire a new whiteness, whiteness being\nits nature, so the Self does not beco=\r\nme Brahman because the Self is\neternally Brahman by nature.\n\nIt is said tha=\r\nt for creating the world Brahman itself became the Self when\nentering the c=\r\nreated bodies. This only means that the Self is never other\nthan Brahman.\nC=\r\nertain expressions, freely used to designate the sage, are next critically\n=\r\nviewed.\n\n545 Two names are commonly in use to designate the sage, namely =\r\n=E2=80=98Knower of\nBrahman=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Knower of the Self=E2=80=\r\n=99. Since the sage is himself Brahman, as\nwell as the Self, how can they b=\r\necome known to the sage?\n\nNeither of the two, which are identical with each=\r\n other, can become the\nobject of knowledge. The Self, as the eternal subjec=\r\nt, is not an object to\nbe known, and Brahman is therefore not an object. Th=\r\ne unknowability of\nBrahman is due to its being the Self. So the terms, take=\r\nn literally, are\ninapplicable. What then are their proper meanings?\n\n546 To=\r\n be free of the notion =E2=80=98I am not Brahman=E2=80=99 is itself the kno=\r\nwing of\nBrahman. Freedom from the notion that anything not the Self is the =\r\nSelf is\nthe correct knowing of the Self.\n\nThe reason is given next.\n\n547 Wh=\r\nen, by making the quest of one=E2=80=99s Self, one becomes consumed, like\nf=\r\nood, by that supreme one, how can anyone survive as separate from it and\nst=\r\nill be called a sage.\nThe use of some word or other to designate one that h=\r\nas found the Self after\nsadhana is necessary and inevitable. But since in t=\r\nhis case the success of\nthe quest involves the loss of the unreal individua=\r\nlity of the seeker,\npractically all the words available are objectionable a=\r\ns implying something\nnot true.\n\nAnother reason, shown next, is that the sta=\r\nte is advaitic.\n\n548 How can one, after experiencing the truth of non-duali=\r\nty [in that\nsupreme state], remain separate from the Supreme Being? For tha=\r\nt state has\nbeen styled, by Sri Krishna, himself, the supreme one, as merge=\r\nr into\nBrahman.\n\nBy this merger there is the loss of individuality.\n\n549 In=\r\n the sacred lore the sage is described in the same terms that Brahman\nitsel=\r\nf is described. Since the true nature of Brahman is pure, supreme\nconscious=\r\nness, the true nature of the sage is not different.\n\nThis is what Bhagavan =\r\nhas to say on this point:\n\n550 =E2=80=98Since no one has two selves, it fol=\r\nlows that the sayings =E2=80=9CI know\nmyself=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CI do not=\r\n know myself=E2=80=9D are both ridiculously nonsensical. The\nSelf never bec=\r\nomes an object to be known.=E2=80=99 Such is the statement made by the\nmost=\r\n holy one [Sri Ramana].\n\nIt may be asked why that state is one of non-duali=\r\nty. The answer is the\nfollowing.\n\n551 This state of being one=E2=80=99s own=\r\n true Self, freed from all limiting\nsuperimpositions, is called the state o=\r\nf non-duality, because in that state\nthe supreme sole reality, the infinite=\r\n Brahman, is not other than that Self.\n\nAn incidental question is whether t=\r\nhe state of non-duality came into\nexistence for the first time at the end o=\r\nf the quest, or had been existing\nall along?\n\n552 The state of the non-dual=\r\n, real Self, experienced by the sage who\nattains the supreme state, is not =\r\nthe fruit of the practice of sadhana. It\nis the eternal nature of that Self=\r\n.\n\nThe following view, held by some, is next stated and discussed.\n\n553 Som=\r\ne say that this duality will remain real as long as one is engaged in\npract=\r\nising sadhana, but that when the goal is reached, non-duality will come\nint=\r\no being by the extinction of the duality.\n\nThese thinkers seek to reconcile=\r\n the dvaitic and advaitic teachings.\n\n554 These men do not know the truth o=\r\nf the transcendental state beyond time,\nin which the world has not come int=\r\no being. Non-duality has neither\nbeginning nor end. Duality, with space and=\r\n time, is unreal, always.\n\nHere, the whole discussion about the world and t=\r\nhe teaching of non-becoming\nare relevant, and also the discussion whether b=\r\nondage is real, which comes\nlater.\n\nWhat then is the use of the sadhana?\n\n5=\r\n55 In the sacred lore it is said, =E2=80=98By the extinction of ego there i=\r\ns, for\nthe aspirant to deliverance, cessation of his delusion=E2=80=99. Wha=\r\nt is real cannot\nbe destroyed by right awareness, nor will anything unreal =\r\nshine as real in\nthe supreme state.\nThe extreme doctrine of the dvaitins is=\r\n next stated and refuted.\n\n556 The conclusion [of the dvaitins] that this d=\r\nuality is always real, that\nit will not cease to exist even when right awar=\r\neness dawns, and that\nnon-duality will never be achieved, is much farther a=\r\nway for the aspirant\n[than the one stated before].\n\nWhat Bhagavan says on t=\r\nhis point is next set forth.\n\n557 Both when it is being sought by the quest=\r\n =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 and when it is\nrealised, the Self is non-dual =\r\nand ever real, just as the tenth man was\nthere all along, even when he was =\r\nbeing sought.\n\nThe reference here is to a parable of the loss and the findi=\r\nng of the tenth\nman in a party of ten. The ten, while travelling, crossed a=\r\n river and then,\none by one, they counted the members to see whether all ha=\r\nd safely crossed\nover. But as each one counted only the others, leaving him=\r\nself out, they\nbelieved that one, the tenth man, was lost. They were bewail=\r\ning the loss\nwhen a passer-by saw them and asked them the cause of their so=\r\nrrow. When he\nwas told, he counted them and found all the ten were there. H=\r\ne convinced\nthem of this truth by making them count the blows he would give=\r\n all of them.\nThere were ten blows and this convinced the men.\n\n558 Those w=\r\nho have understood, as taught in Mandukya, the truth of the\nnon-becoming of=\r\n the supreme reality, will not be perplexed by these theories\nof the ignora=\r\nnt, because they are firmly convinced of the true nature of the\nSupreme Bei=\r\nng.\n563 Since the real Self is all that is, when that Self is won, nothing\n=\r\nremains for the sage to be won. Hence, in the sacred lore the sage is as on=\r\ne\nwho has attained and enjoyed all objects of desire and is, therefore,\ndes=\r\nireless, just like God Himself.\nIt must be remembered that God is really im=\r\npersonal, as Brahman, so that the\npersonal God is only a modification of it=\r\n.\n\n564 Viveka Chudamani asks, =E2=80=98How can one who has experienced the =\r\ntruth of his\nown Self identify with his body and suffer from desiring objec=\r\nts? Who is\nthere left to desire?=E2=80=99 This revelation shows that for th=\r\ne sage desires do\nnot arise.\n\n565 Only that man has desires who identifies =\r\nhimself with the body.But the\nsage has become free from the thought =E2=80=\r\n=98I am the body=E2=80=99. The sage looks upon\nhis own body as if it were t=\r\nhe body of another.\n\nThe first sentence in the above is a quotation from th=\r\ne Viveka Chudamani.\nAnother powerful reason is that the sage is by nature e=\r\nternally happy with\nthe bliss of the real Self. This has been stated and ex=\r\nplained before.\n\nBut the bliss of the sage does not cause bondage, as is sh=\r\nown next.\n\n566 In the supreme state there is no tasting of bliss, for there=\r\n the sense\nof being happy or miserable cannot arise. Since in that state th=\r\nere are no\npairs of opposites, the bliss of the sage has no similarities to=\r\n the\npleasures and miseries of samsara.\n\nThe explanation is that while, in =\r\nsamsara, pleasures are from external\nobjects, in the natural state the blis=\r\ns is the very nature of the Self, who\nis identical with Parabrahman.\n\nThis =\r\ndifference is related to another, which is dealt with next.\n\nSource: http:/=\r\n/www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016367f97645c5fdf04a1e51e88\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;M=\r\nARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;537 The power there is in the si=\r\nlence of the Guru is immeasurable.

Since the sage is himself Brahman, as well =\r\nas the Self, how can they become known to the sage?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither of the t=\r\nwo, which are identical with each other, can become the object of knowledge=\r\n. The Self, as the eternal subject, is not an object to be known, and Brahm=\r\nan is therefore not an object. The unknowability of Brahman is due to its b=\r\neing the Self. So the terms, taken literally, are inapplicable. What then a=\r\nre their proper meanings?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;546 To be free of the notion =E2=80=98I a=\r\nm not Brahman=E2=80=99 is itself the knowing of Brahman.

What is real cannot b=\r\ne destroyed by right awareness, nor will anything unreal shine as real in t=\r\nhe supreme state.&lt;br&gt;\nThe extreme doctrine of the dvaitins is next stated a=\r\nnd refuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;556 The conclusion [of the dvaitins] that this duality i=\r\ns always real, that it will not cease to exist even when right awareness da=\r\nwns, and that non-duality will never be achieved, is much farther away for =\r\nthe aspirant [than the one stated before].&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;What Bhagavan says on th=\r\nis point is next set forth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;557 Bo=\r\nth when it is being sought by the quest =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 and whe=\r\nn it is realised, the Self is non-dual and ever real, just as the tenth man=\r\n was there all along, even when he was being sought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The ref=\r\nerence here is to a parable of the loss and the finding of the tenth man in=\r\n a party of ten. The ten, while travelling, crossed a river and then, one b=\r\ny one, they counted the members to see whether all had safely crossed over.=\r\n But as each one counted only the others, leaving himself out, they believe=\r\nd that one, the tenth man, was lost. They were bewailing the loss when a pa=\r\nsser-by saw them and asked them the cause of their sorrow. When he was told=\r\n, he counted them and found all the ten were there. He convinced them of th=\r\nis truth by making them count the blows he would give all of them. There we=\r\nre ten blows and this convinced the men.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;558 Those who have underst=\r\nood, as taught in Mandukya, the truth of the non-becoming of the supreme re=\r\nality, will not be perplexed by these theories of the ignorant, because the=\r\ny are firmly convinced of the true nature of the Supreme Being.&lt;br&gt;\n563 Sin=\r\nce the real Self is all that is, when that Self is won, nothing remains for=\r\n the sage to be won. Hence, in the sacred lore the sage is as one who has a=\r\nttained and enjoyed all objects of desire and is, therefore, desireless, ju=\r\nst like God Himself.&lt;br&gt;\nIt must be remembered that God is really impersona=\r\nl, as Brahman, so that the personal God is only a modification of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;564 Viveka Chudamani asks, =E2=80=98How=\r\n can one who has experienced the truth of his own Self identify with his bo=\r\ndy and suffer from desiring objects? Who is there left to desire?=E2=80=99 =\r\nThis revelation shows that for the sage desires do not arise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;565 Only that man has desires who identifies himself with the body.&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;But the sage has become free from the thought =\r\n=E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. The sage looks upon his own body as if it =\r\nwere the body of another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The first sentence in the above is=\r\n a quotation from the Viveka Chudamani.&lt;br&gt;Another powerful reason is that =\r\nthe sage is by nature eternally happy with the bliss of the real Self. This=\r\n has been stated and explained before.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;But the bliss of the sage do=\r\nes not cause bondage, as is shown next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;566 In the supreme state the=\r\nre is no tasting of bliss, for there the sense of being happy or miserable =\r\ncannot arise. Since in that state there are no pairs of opposites, the blis=\r\ns of the sage has no similarities to the pleasures and miseries of samsara.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;The explanation is that while, i=\r\nn samsara, pleasures are from external objects, in the natural state the bl=\r\niss is the very nature of the Self, who is identical with Parabrahman.&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;This difference is related to another, which is dealt with next.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.da=\r\nvidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;div style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; MARGIN=\r\n: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:=\r\n 87%; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=\r\n=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016367f97645c5fdf04a1e51e88--\r\n\n"}}
