A brahmana&#39;s job\n&gt; is to pursue knowledge and self-realization and beco=\r\nme a beacon of knowledge\n&gt; for the society. One can do that by engaging in =\r\nrituals for dharma in the\n&gt; society or teach people or just do tapascharya =\r\nor so many other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Though Krishna&#39;s directive to Arjuna=\r\n has been interpreted in the context of\n&gt; varnashrama or, loosely speaking,=\r\n caste system, it is not so simple. Krishna\n&gt; asked Arjuna to follow &quot;swa-d=\r\nharma&quot;, i.e. one&#39;s own dharma, and avoid\n&gt; paradharma, i.e. other people&#39;s =\r\ndharma. It is not that there are four kinds\n&gt; of dharma in the world. Each =\r\nperson has one&#39;s own dharma, that is decided\n&gt; based on who one has been in=\r\n previous lives, what karmik debts one has, what\n&gt; desires and conditioning=\r\n one has, and what abilities one has. Each person\n&gt; has a unique dharma.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; But it is not easy to find what exactly one&#39;s dharma is! Arjuna was lucky=\r\n\n&gt; and had a guru like Krishna, who told him his dharma was to kill those\n&gt;=\r\n armies of relatives, gurus, elders etc. Shankaracharya was lucky to have a=\r\n\n&gt; guru like Govinda Bhagavatpada, who told him he had to write commentarie=\r\ns on\n&gt; Vedic literature and debate.

It is not easy! If you have a trusted\n&gt; guru, =\r\nfollow him/her. Otherwise, follow the internal guru, i.e. the\n&gt; instincts f=\r\nrom your conscience. Unfortunately, one sees one&#39;s dharma clearly\n&gt; only if=\r\n one is pure. And, one becomes pure only if one fulfills most of\n&gt; one&#39;s dh=\r\narma. This is a catch-22 situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; The simplest algorithm is to listen=\r\n to your trusted guru (an external\n&gt; person or internal conscience), discha=\r\nrge the dharma as said by guru and try\n&gt; to increase surrender and detachme=\r\nnt in actions. As detachment increases and\n&gt; some dharma gets fulfilled, pu=\r\nrity increases and clarity on what one&#39;s\n&gt; dharma is increases. As that hap=\r\npens, one can become more detached. And so\n&gt; on. If one keeps doing this pa=\r\ntiently and keeps doing sadhana and\n&gt; contemplation, one will eventually br=\r\neak through into right track.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- &quot;nagraj@... &lt;nagraj%40sbcglobal.net&gt;&quot; &lt;n=\r\nagraj_um@...&lt;nagraj_um%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dear everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I have just realized that geeta in the chapter karma yoga, constantly\n&gt;=\r\n talks about yagna (homa?) as the main activity and also asserts that whoev=\r\ner\n&gt; is not doing homa is just adding his karma all the time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For i=\r\nnstance, 3.9 states that\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karma=\r\nbandhanah\n&gt; &gt; tadartham karma kaunteya mukasangah samachara&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; which =\r\nroughly translates to &quot;karmas other than those for yagna (homa) are\n&gt; only =\r\ngoing to increase the bondage and hence you should only that karma that\n&gt; i=\r\ns meant for yagna&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now this in arjuna&#39;s case means that he should =\r\njust do the war, as that\n&gt; is his yagna!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my case, does that mean=\r\n that I should leave my job as a software\n&gt; engineer and keep doing homas, =\r\nand chanting vedam as that is my vihita karma\n&gt; as I am a brahmin by birth?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Verse 13 also goes to say that I am only eating sin if I am doing\n=\r\n&gt; something outside of vedam to get my bread, which I am clearly doing by\n&gt;=\r\n working as an IT professional in the USA!

This is a catch-22 situation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nThe simplest algorithm is to listen to your trusted guru (an external=\r\n person or internal conscience), discharge the dharma as said by guru and t=\r\nry to increase surrender and detachment in actions. As detachment increases=\r\n and some dharma gets fulfilled, purity increases and clarity on what one&#=\r\n39;s dharma is increases. As that happens, one can become more detached. An=\r\nd so on. If one keeps doing this patiently and keeps doing sadhana and cont=\r\nemplation, one will eventually break through into right track.&lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;br&gt;\nB=\r\nest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------&lt;br&gt;\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Films th=\r\nat make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n---- &quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj%40sbcglobal.net=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nagraj@...&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:na=\r\ngraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nagraj_um@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Dear everyone, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have just realized that geeta=\r\n in the chapter karma yoga, constantly talks about yagna (homa?) as the mai=\r\nn activity and also asserts that whoever is not doing homa is just adding h=\r\nis karma all the time. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For instance, 3.9 states that &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;yagnyaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karmabandhanah&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;  tadartham karma kaunteya mukasangah samachara&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; which roughly translates to &quot;karmas other than those for yagna (=\r\nhoma) are only going to increase the bondage and hence you should only that=\r\n karma that is meant for yagna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now this in arjuna=\r\n&#39;s case means that he should just do the war, as that is his yagna! &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In my case, does that mean that I should leave my job as a=\r\n software engineer and keep doing homas, and chanting vedam as that is my v=\r\nihita karma as I am a brahmin by birth? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Verse 13 also g=\r\noes to say that I am only eating sin if I am doing something outside of ved=\r\nam to get my bread, which I am clearly doing by working as an IT profession=\r\nal in the USA! Does this mean that we should all leave what we are doing an=\r\nd go back to our native places and keep doing our kula vritti as defined by=\r\n our vihita karmas as defined by our scriptures? I am very confused and nee=\r\nd PVRjis help to understand this better. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nagraj&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255)=\r\n; min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016e6464d2224eaea0493977ed8--\r\n\n"}}
