Some of it can be=\r\n genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spir=\r\nitual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand thes=\r\ne things properly, but some pattern is observable.=C2=A0 Not all experience=\r\ns are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle =\r\nof experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genuine and=\r\n which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral plane, driven by the ove=\r\nrlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human b=\r\neing. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence =\r\n(overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=C2=A0=\r\n is possible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestat=\r\nion in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless bein=\r\ngs of varies character and hue who can very easily create an\n&gt;  expereince =\r\nfor a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experie=\r\nnce/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and=\r\n use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower ext=\r\nreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego=\r\n driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, =\r\njealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at=\r\n the other extreme this layer can, if properly channalized as is done in ge=\r\nnuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manifes=\r\nt the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell, a=\r\n genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only to the extent that it help=\r\ns to modify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the only=\r\n true test. Rest all the range of experiences that come from this realm, an=\r\nd 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound =\r\nand fury without substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he call=\r\ns it the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have =\r\ngot swept away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to c=\r\nross this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to h=\r\nang on tightly to the fundamentals.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mam=\r\nAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From:=\r\n vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent=\r\n: Tuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

Thought I =\r\nwill share it here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Progress has little to do with speed; but muc=\r\nh to do with direction. So always concentrate on your direction, not on spe=\r\ned.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For any genuine spiritual seeker, this is one of the sanest a=\r\ndvices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, too many people get caught up =\r\nin the less important - aka, visions, &#39;experiences&#39;, tough-penances, comple=\r\nx rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetting the goal of real spir=\r\nituality, that is transformation of mind/emotions/body resulting in greater=\r\n surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity to life situations, an abiding=\r\n calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening of lower emotions like lust, a=\r\nnger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious attachments, such that eventuall=\r\ny every action of the individual is like a consecration (sacrifice, yagjya)=\r\n to the Divine. A life so transformed and so away from our average superfic=\r\nial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God is not the fin=\r\nish line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive unfolding of a transforma=\r\ntion process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complex rituals and speedy sadhanas and experiences =\r\net al are ok, provided one does not lose sight of the fundamentals. THEN th=\r\nese can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in circles and going nowhe=\r\nre. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritual entity.
