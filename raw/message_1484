Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whate=\r\nver is one&#39;s path, Kundalini is not only awakened but goes to Sahasrara \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; when one is established in undifferentiated Self. Even if one does not th=\r\nink \n&gt; &gt; in those terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that one =\r\ncan \n&gt; &gt; realize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more accu=\r\nrate \n&gt; &gt; statement would be that one can realize the highest truths withou=\r\nt engaging \n&gt; &gt; in any specific practices geared at awakening or raising Ku=\r\nndalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or o=\r\nther raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. Howev=\r\ner, such practices are \n&gt; &gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini. Peop=\r\nle belonging to various \n&gt; &gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to Hind=\r\nuism, can experience Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; awakening, without knowing anything abo=\r\nut the name or the symbolism. There \n&gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions about =\r\nKundalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini is essentially t=\r\nhe force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and \n&gt; &gt; raised kundalini implie=\r\ns a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the lowest level, w=\r\ne bind our selves to specific bodies and our \n&gt; &gt; self-awareness is limited=\r\n to a body, a name and other things associated with \n&gt; &gt; the body and name.=\r\n This experience of self as a body corresponds to \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini sleeping a=\r\nt Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the \n&gt; &gt; undifferentiated Self, =\r\nknown as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This \n&gt; &gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self cor=\r\nresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As \n&gt; &gt; self-awareness goes from the fo=\r\nrmer to the latter, it may traverse through \n&gt; &gt; many stages in between. Co=\r\nrrespondingly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first ti=\r\nme, like a \n&gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down a=\r\ngain and the \n&gt; &gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kundali=\r\nni will work its \n&gt; &gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e.=\r\n undesirable \n&gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises hi=\r\ngh at the time of \n&gt; &gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and =\r\nyet rise high through \n&gt; &gt; the impurities. This may manifest physically as =\r\na powerful experience \n&gt; &gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing in the back=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact =\r\npath taken \n&gt; &gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixed. I=\r\nt may change from \n&gt; &gt; person to person, based on the impurities in various=\r\n nadis. The exact \n&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path travers=\r\ned and the final point \n&gt; &gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before w=\r\nithdrawal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening,=\r\n rise to Sahasrara \n&gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same t=\r\nime. His nadis had \n&gt; &gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he =\r\ndirectly went into \n&gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a=\r\n fully realized person. \n&gt; &gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Saying &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. T=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; exact experience changes from person to person, depending on the pa=\r\nth \n&gt; &gt; traversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say =\r\none thing \n&gt; &gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one wil=\r\nl not have any \n&gt; &gt; confusion about what happened. But, until kundalini awa=\r\nkening occurs, one \n&gt; &gt; may confuse various other experiences (such as some=\r\n movement of vayu in \n&gt; &gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly=\r\n think that kundalini is \n&gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are=\r\n NOT \n&gt; &gt; due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little v=\r\naayu \n&gt; &gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not=\r\n a \n&gt; &gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sens=\r\nation \n&gt; &gt; of having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting nor=\r\nmally in \n&gt; &gt; reality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a reference, I can narrate the experience o=\r\nf ONE person. He was \n&gt; &gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru =\r\nhad told him a few months \n&gt; &gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakenin=\r\ng had come. However, he had \n&gt; &gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and =\r\nwas totally uninformed about \n&gt; &gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not =\r\nengage in any specific raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; yoga practices. All he did was to si=\r\nt with his back erect and eyes closed \n&gt; &gt; and meditate with a veda mantra.=\r\n In the weeks before kundalini awakening, he \n&gt; &gt; started experiencing vari=\r\nous premonitory signs. He guru told him not to be \n&gt; &gt; distracted by them a=\r\nnd to keep the focus on the mantra and try to forget \n&gt; &gt; everything else. =\r\nWhen mind starts dwelling on an experience, it gets stuck \n&gt; &gt; there and ca=\r\nnnot go higher.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfec=\r\ntly and intensely focused \n&gt; &gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased mome=\r\nntarily. Suddenly he became \n&gt; &gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was =\r\na really tremendous explosion at \n&gt; &gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt l=\r\nike a huge amount of electric current \n&gt; &gt; was going up his spine from the =\r\nbase. Then it felt like he was not a body \n&gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it f=\r\nelt like he was going up like a rocket at a \n&gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it =\r\nfelt like there was a tremendously bright white \n&gt; &gt; light and there was no=\r\nthing else. It felt like he was not a small point in \n&gt; &gt; that light, but h=\r\ne was the light itself. There was an undescribable sense of \n&gt; &gt; peace and =\r\nhappiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this? \n&gt; &gt; What =\r\nhappened to my body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became \n&gt; &gt; aw=\r\nare of himself as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and went out, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For example,=\r\n a \n&gt; &gt; serial was coming on TV and characters in the serial that he normal=\r\nly \n&gt; &gt; disliked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like real pe=\r\nople and \n&gt; &gt; he had great love and compassion for those TV serial characte=\r\nrs (and other \n&gt; &gt; real people too). That state of love and compassion last=\r\ned a while and then \n&gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This short experience was =\r\nonly the beginning of a journey. He experienced \n&gt; &gt; many things later on. =\r\nThese experiences were different from each other. As I \n&gt; &gt; said earlier, t=\r\nhe experience varies based on the path traversed and the \n&gt; &gt; point reached=\r\n by the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions, \n&gt; &gt; kundalini ro=\r\nse and he saw several sights and several beings within and heard \n&gt; &gt; sever=\r\nal sounds, including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n He realized the transientness of a lot that we cling on to and the existen=\r\nce \n&gt; &gt; of something far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All this slowl=\r\ny started to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards \n&gt; &gt; and he cri=\r\ntically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives and worked \n&gt; &gt; on =\r\ncorrecting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhat others did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that kund=\r\nalini \n&gt; &gt; awakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Depe=\r\nnding on \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or e=\r\nven lives.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini awakening is onl=\r\ny a beginning. It is not an end. Even the rise of \n&gt; &gt; kundalini to a chakr=\r\na is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of people \n&gt; &gt; with awakened kun=\r\ndalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very few \n&gt; &gt; make it to =\r\nthe next chakra or the one after, but end up getting stuck there. \n&gt; &gt; Very=\r\n very few make it to higher chakras. And a very small minority actually \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; realise self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa de=\r\nscribed by Sri Krishna in \n&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sa=\r\ndhana, whether you are into raja \n&gt; &gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or =\r\njnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical \n&gt; &gt; experience can only distract one f=\r\nrom this goal. I urge sadhakas, especially \n&gt; &gt; those who respect my advice=\r\n, to forget about kundalini and chakras and just \n&gt; &gt; keep doing homam and =\r\njapam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep \n&gt; &gt; purifying themselves w=\r\nith sadhana, keep working on their attitude and \n&gt; &gt; thought process and ke=\r\nep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes \n&gt; &gt; purified and one =\r\novercomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini WILL \n&gt; &gt; happen aut=\r\nomatically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and mystical \n&gt; &gt; expe=\r\nriences is a big deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; sad=\r\nhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n way your mind works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will \n&gt; &gt; aut=\r\nomatically follow. One will do well to remember these words.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\ntarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message=\r\n ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Relevant to this on=\r\n going subject, i remember reading autobiography of Shri \n&gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (=\r\nPrakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; Awakening i=\r\ns not mandatory for realization.

When one =\r\nattains a perfect focus on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra and distracting thoughts cease=\r\n, praana moves downward from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward=\r\n. After praana and apaana combine, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid=\r\n speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first ti=\r\nme, it may feel like an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves up, =\r\nit will feel like one is freed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exis=\r\nt. This is similar to death, except \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusi=\r\non at death and one may feel a kind of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens dur=\r\ning meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one =\r\nbecome &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the =\r\nrational mind, there is a chance of one becoming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confu=\r\nsed.

In fact, thinking about them, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific practices may become an obstacle and =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delay things.

How can i \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Be=\r\nloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correc=\r\ntly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as tha=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the s=\r\nadhak or the deity commanding a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it wha=\r\nt appears to be good or be it that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The =\r\ndeity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care =\r\nalmost for nothing himself, so self \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised an=\r\nd the person&#39;s spiritual evolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, th=\r\nere is=C2 very little=C2 according to me which is black magic. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It =\r\nis all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the =\r\ndeath \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or =\r\nif he was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm res=\r\nerved for these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the=\r\n full bearing of karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some pe=\r\nople may realise this to their detriment( \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandh=\r\nar Nath burying the city of Patan with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earth=\r\nquake). Some people may even equate this with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here th=\r\nere is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal pers=\r\non, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you=\r\n harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody =\r\nwho is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left,=\r\n then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\non the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification=\r\n with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally =\r\ntermed as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits =\r\nwhich they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable e=\r\nxperience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few li=\r\nfetimes, then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity =\r\nand such a sadhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(be=\r\ncause of his previous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody =\r\ndoing this mantra only in this lifetime may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 thing=\r\ns which bind every mantra are crucial and may not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this =\r\nlifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating=\r\n, so let me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined=\r\n, then starting on some good day, do 1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitr=\r\ni(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden=\r\n) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same pla=\r\nce.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movem=\r\nent as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs=\r\n before you start, make sure your bowels are empty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you star=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lo=\r\nng and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which w=\r\nere being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mani=\r\nsh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you =\r\nfeel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
