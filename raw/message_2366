Out of w=\r\nhat all you&#39;ve mentioned, i was aware of only &#39;Rest&#39; part.\n\nThough one ques=\r\ntion comes in my mind after reading your message. on physical level, do the=\r\n Men really require cleansing every month as the women require it? may be n=\r\not?\nI am not sure of Spiritual cleansing you mentioned for women. may well =\r\nbe true or may not be.\n\nany ways, it was a fresh read.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpa=\r\nl \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, a woman&#39;s prana shakti is much stronger during her time o=\r\nf menses.\n&gt; If a woman does manasika japa during this time, it is multiple =\r\norders more\n&gt; powerful. In certain paths of sadhana (Matangi worship, for e=\r\nxample), woman\n&gt; is at her most auspicious when she is menstruating. So to =\r\ncompare this state\n&gt; to a person being smelly or sweaty is, I think, a misc=\r\nharacterization.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, there are elements of ritual impurity. But it is=\r\n also true that the\n&gt; time of menstruation is a time ofi inner purification=\r\n and cleansing (on a\n&gt; physicial and spiritual level) for women that men (u=\r\nnfortunately for them)\n&gt; do not have access to. In a way, external sadhana =\r\nis required for men to\n&gt; obtain the fruits of the automatic purification wo=\r\nmen attain through\n&gt; menstruation.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is another reason why women ar=\r\ne advised to take complete rest during\n&gt; their menses--not that they&#39;re goi=\r\nng to contaminate everything around them,\n&gt; but the process of cleansing go=\r\ning on within is a subtle and sensitive\n&gt; process that is optimized when a =\r\nwoman can fully rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, a woman&#39;s work never ends, so this practic=\r\ne is a way of ensuring women\n&gt; get their much needed rest, including rest f=\r\nrom sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just wanted to add this, because I think sometimes wome=\r\nn get the wrong\n&gt; impression that they are somehow debased or otherwise ina=\r\nuspicious during\n&gt; their time of menstruation and therefore kept away fromt=\r\nhe privilege of\n&gt; doing worship. But that is a very crude view and I think =\r\nthe more nuanced\n&gt; understanding that our ancient rishis (and yoginis) had =\r\nwas that this is a\n&gt; special time for women when external sadhana is not re=\r\nquired since internal\n&gt; cleansing is going on and a time when her energies =\r\nand kundalini are\n&gt; naturally sensitized and heightened, so special care sh=\r\nould be taken.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, there is no restriction on doing manasika japa (w=\r\nithout moving the\n&gt; lips) for a woman during this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 28=\r\n, 2009 at 10:29 AM, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; De=\r\nar narayana,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for this knowledge.
