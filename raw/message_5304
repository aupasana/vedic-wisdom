They are not evil forces. They are simply unfortunate souls in great misery, troubled by undesirable vasanas. They are not to be hated, but to be pitied and empathized.\n \nYes, beings with evil intentions are unlikely to be present at the residence of a saint like like Gopaler Ma.\n \n&gt; Is it that such beings/entities cannot be helped or is it just\n&gt; wise to leave them alone if they do not want to be disturbed?\n \nWorld runs on the basis of action and reaction. Any being that is in pain and stuck in a place is so due to some serious blocking karmas. Release of those karmas may be difficult. It is not easy to help each and every being. You can only pick some to help and help them, guided by your own kaarmik debts. Moreover, you can help someone only if they want to be helped.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere is one more thing here.\n \nEven a self-realized person is limited in one&#39;s ability to uplift other beings. An object (a person) may overcome its gravity (individual ego and will) and start to freely flow in the wind (flow with divine will) without any resistance. But it cannot lift every object around it. A big leaf that is freely floating in air can perhaps support a few insects. A big rock that is freely floating in air can perhaps support more beings. A big hill that is freely floating in air can perhaps support far more beings.\n \nLike that, different beings are of different calibers in the field of duality, though all may be the same at the non-dual level. As they become liberated from their conditioning, their ability to uplift others from blocking conditioning varies from yogi to yogi.\n \nBut, I want to emphasize one thing here. A leaf is leaf, a rock is a rock and a hill is a hill. Leaf cannot become hill or hill cannot become rock. So, one cannot worry about achieving this or that. Whether one is a leaf or a rock or a hill, one should try to overcome gravity and freely float. What one does after that is not one&#39;s business, but the business of divine Will.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYour questions reminded me of a facebook message exchange I saw just a couple of days back. One member of this group sent a message to Manish and me and Manish replied to him. I will quote the facebook message thread, without revealing the identity of the member.\n \nMember: &quot;Yesterday night, I was feeling very very depressed for reasons both in the house as well as work place and was mentally scolding everyone why this is happening to me. I drifted off to sleep around 11 pm and woke up 30 mins later to find a small beggar-like boy with dishevelled brown hair looking at me...my first reaction was of fright and fear and I shouted &quot;shoo!&quot;. When shouting, I closed my eyes momentarily and when I opened them, the &#39;boy&#39; was gone. I felt a great wave of sadness engulfing me and thought that the deity (whoever it be)had come to test me and I failed the test. Weird to say but my wife didnt stir during the whole episode despite me shaking her and my mother didnt hear any noise from my bedroom...am left wondering if I hallucinated...dont know what to do now.&quot;\n \nManish: &quot;No, it was not a deity, more likely the spirit causing the problems.&quot;\n \nMember: &quot;eeks! now I am frightened...tell me what I should do?&quot;\n \nManish: &quot;Why would you be frightened?, they are just like you, only thoda different. If you saw a child on the road like this how would you behave? With compassion, I hope.\nBe like Bholenath, He says, to all the bhoot, pretas, pisachas, &quot;My children, I know nobody wants you anymore, just sit with Me, nobody will trouble you here.&quot;\nBe compassionate, nothing in this Universe can touch you unless your own karmas give it the license to do so.&quot;\n \n[Glossary: thoda = a little, Bholenath = Lord Shiva, bhoot, pretas, pisachas = different kinds of spirits]\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;n_shashi@...&quot; &lt;n_shashi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently I happened to see a few &#39;Paranormal State&#39; episodes and observed that the so called entities/beings identified or located are left alone mostly even when there is priest around.\n&gt;\n&gt; This brought to my mind a similar incident which i remember vaguely of having read long time back in one of &#39;Ramakrishna&#39; books (dont remember the name), where Ramakrishna and Rakhal was one day staying late at Gopaler Ma&#39;s place and in the night Sri Ramakrisha was visited by some entity/being in a sad state who came to him and requested him to leave the place as Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s presence was making the entity/being miserable. Ramakrishna immediately woke up Rakhal and left the place, avoiding giving any reasons to people in the house.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gopalers Ma was somebody who was immersed in god and still had such entities/beings around?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also brings the question why is it that the entities/beings in sad state left alone by psychics and spiritual persons without doing anything for their upliftment?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it that such beings/entities cannot be helped or is it just wise to leave them alone if they do not want to be disturbed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is their any Vedic explanations/suggestions on such situations as above?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Shashi\n\n\n"}}
