Some misconceptions are there in some sections of orthodox tradition. What you heard is not correct and go ahead with lighting the ghee lamp everyday.\n \nLakshmi, whether in the form of Dhana Lakshmi (wealth) or Dhanya lakshmi (grains and food) or Vidya Lakshmi (knowledge), should be shared with the world and put to good use. Then only Lakshmi will grow. If one selfishly keeps one&#39;s wealth or food or knowledge to oneself and keeps it *captive*, Lakshmi will not grow. Instead, Lakshmi will leave one then.\n \nNever keep Lakshmi that you get captive. Share Her with others and put Her to good use. Then She will be pleased and do good to you.\n \nThe principle you heard is based on a misconception on how to handle Lakshmi.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Gurujans,\n&gt;  \n&gt; On TV someone said that Cow&#39;s Ghee represents Laxmi & one should not light a Lamp of it daily in House as it will burn away the wealth of the person.
