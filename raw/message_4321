When a brahmin\ninhabitant of the village named Prab=\r\nhakara heard about his arrival he went\nto him with his thirteen year old so=\r\nn. He prostrated before Sankara and made\nhis son also prostrate. He then ex=\r\nplained that the boy had been dumb from\nhis childhood, that he had no likes=\r\n and dislikes, nor a sense of honour and\ndishonour, and that he was complet=\r\nely inactive. The Guru then raised the boy\nup and asked him as follows in a=\r\n cheerful tone:\n\nText\n\n1. `Who are you? Whose child are you? Whither are yo=\r\nu bound? What is your\nname? Whence have you come? Oh Child! I should like t=\r\no hear your reply to\nthese questions.&#39; Thus spoke Sri Shankaracharya to the=\r\n boy, and Hastamalaka\nreplied as follows.\n\n2. I am neither man, God, yaksha=\r\n, brahmin, kshatriya,vaisya, sudra,\nbrahmachari, householder, forest-dwelle=\r\nr, nor sannyasi; but I am pure\nawareness alone.\n\n3. Just as the sun causes =\r\nall worldly movements, so do I -- the\never-present, conscious Self -- cause=\r\n the mind to be active and the senses\nto function. Again, just as the ether=\r\n is all-pervading, yet devoid of any\nspecific qualities, so am I free from =\r\nall qualities.\n\n4. I am the conscious Self, ever-present and associated wit=\r\nh everything in\nthe same manner as heat is always associated with fire. I a=\r\nm that eternal,\nundifferentiated, unshaken Consciousness, on account of whi=\r\nch the insentient\nmind and senses function, each in its own manner.\n\n5. I a=\r\nm that conscious Self of whom the ego is not independent as the image\nin a =\r\nmirror is not independent of the object reflected.\n\n\n6. I am the unqualifie=\r\nd, conscious Self, existing even after the extinction\nof buddhi, just as th=\r\ne object remains ever the same even after the removal\nof the reflecting mir=\r\nror.\n\n7. I am eternal Consciousness, dissociated from the mind and senses. =\r\nI am\nthe mind of the mind, the eye of the eye, ear of the ear and so on. I =\r\nam not\ncognizable by the mind and senses.\n\n8. I am the eternal, single, con=\r\nscious Self, reflected in various\nintellects, just as the sun is reflected =\r\non the surface of various sheets of\nwater.\n\n9. I am the single, conscious S=\r\nelf, illumining all intellects, just as the\nsun simultaneously illumines al=\r\nl eyes so that they perceive objects.\n\n10. Only those eyes that are helped =\r\nby the sun are capable of seeing\nobjects, not others. The source from which=\r\n the sun derives its power is\nmyself.\n\n11. Just as the reflection of the su=\r\nn on agitated waters seems to break up,\nbut remains perfect on a calm surfa=\r\nce, so also am I, the conscious Self,\nunrecognizable in agitated intellects=\r\n though I clearly shine in those which\nare calm.\n\n12. Just as a fool thinks=\r\n that the sun is entirely lost when it is hidden by\ndense clouds, so do peo=\r\nple think that the ever-free Self is bound.\n\n13. Just as the ether is all-p=\r\nervading and unaffected by contact, so also\ndoes the ever-conscious Self pe=\r\nrvade everything without being affected in\nanyway. I am that Self.\n\n14. Jus=\r\nt as a transparent crystal takes on the lines of its background, but\nis in =\r\nno way changed thereby, and just as the unchanging moon on being\nreflected =\r\non undulating surfaces appears agitated, so is it with you, the\nall-pervadi=\r\nng God.\n\n15. As this stotra reveals the Self as clearly as the amalaka frui=\r\nt placed\non the palm of the hand (hasta), it received the name Hastamalaka =\r\nStrotra.\nMoreover, the boy, eminent in jnana, came to be praised by all peo=\r\nple of\nthis world as Hastamalaka.\n\nThe father of the boy was speechless wit=\r\nh wonder at those words. But the\nAcharya said to him: `He has become your s=\r\non because of his incomplete\nausterities. This is your good fortune. He wil=\r\nl not be of any use to you in\nthis world. Let him stay with me.&#39; He bade hi=\r\nm go back and, taking the boy\nwith him, proceeded on his way. The disciples=\r\n then asked him: `How did this\nboy attain the state of Brahman without hear=\r\ning, etc.?&#39; The Guru replied:\n`His mother left her two year old child in th=\r\ne care of a great and highly\naccomplished yogi who was practising austeriti=\r\nes on the bank of the Yamuna\nwhile she went to bathe in the river with some=\r\n women. The child toddled\ntowards the water and was drowned. Out of his com=\r\npassion for the\ndisconsolate mother the sadhu forsook his body and entered =\r\nthat of the\nchild. That is why this boy has attained this high state.&#39;\n\nSou=\r\nrces:\n1) COLLECTED WORKS OF SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI BOOK\n2)\nhttp://ramana-colle=\r\ncted-works.blogspot.com/2007/06/hastamalaka-stotra.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81\n\r\n--0016e65bcecad5caac048623eb86\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Introduction by Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;When Shankara, the Guru of the world, was travelling=\r\n in the western parts of India and overcoming in debate the expounders of t=\r\nhe various schools of thought, he once came to a village known as Srivali. =\r\nWhen a brahmin inhabitant of the village named Prabhakara heard about his a=\r\nrrival he went to him with his thirteen year old son.
