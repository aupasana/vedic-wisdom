I hope you won&#39;t mind.\n\n* * *\n\nBackground for others:\n\n=\r\nThis gentleman had a telephone conversation with me a few days back. He is =\r\nan advaitin. He was doing some rituals earlier. He happened to read &quot;I Am T=\r\nhat&quot; book by Nisargadatta Maharaj, an adwaiti and a liberated master. In th=\r\ne weeks after reading that book, he had a series of mystical experiences th=\r\nat revealed one idea after another to him. Based on his experiences, he tol=\r\nd me that all that we perceive is an illusion and even knowledge and ignora=\r\nnce are illusions. Is there a need to perform rituals and why? This whole t=\r\nhing is like a dream and why do we need to do specific things in what we kn=\r\now to be a dream?\n\nI mostly listened to what he was saying without saying a=\r\nnything, but said a few things at the end. He said that he sees everything =\r\nfor what it is during an experience, but back to normal at the end of it, e=\r\n.g. worried about a sore throat and stuff like that.\n\nI told him that that =\r\nstate of not having fear or likes or dislikes has to be permanent and not a=\r\n fleeting experience. I told him it is good to say duality is an illusion, =\r\nbut one needs to deal with it when one is immersed in that illusion most of=\r\n the time. A fleeting experience of reality and immersion in the illusion a=\r\ngain is not liberation. One needs to strive for a state when one is in that=\r\n state all the time. To reach that state, it is necessary to pay back one&#39;s=\r\n karmik debts in the field of duality.\n\nI told him that rituals like homam =\r\ncan be performed without an individual sankalpa, but just for the pleasure =\r\nof the deity. Thus, one ends up giving something to the universe without co=\r\nnsidering whether and what one gets in return. That is conducive to freedom=\r\n.\n\nHe pondered on my words for a few days and replied. I will continue the =\r\ndiscussion below with him on the list now.\n\n* * *\n\nYour question is a very =\r\nimportant one and addressed by many scriptures such as Upanishads, Yoga Vaa=\r\nsishtham, Bhagavad Gita etc.\n\nVasishtha taught in Yoga Vaasishtham that kno=\r\nwledge (understanding) and action are the two wings with which the bird of =\r\nsoul flies. It is not possible for one wing to reach the correct speed at o=\r\nnce. As the wings are flapped, one wing will take off, the other will take =\r\noff accordingly, the first wing gains more speed and so on. Eventually, whe=\r\nn there is balance between the two wings, bird flies off.\n\nPerfect understa=\r\nnding and perfect actions do not come by themselves suddenly. Actions and u=\r\nnderstanding work together, balance each other and improve each other.\n\nOne=\r\n can start off with some understanding and engage in actions that imbibe th=\r\nat understanding. As one engages in more and more actions that are aligned =\r\nwith one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s understanding becomes better and better. As one&#39;s =\r\nunderstanding becomes better and better, it enables actions that are more a=\r\nnd more aligned with one&#39;s dharma. Better understanding results in better a=\r\nctions and better actions result in better understanding. You cannot separa=\r\nte knowledge from actions. As I said, Vasishtha was very clear that knowled=\r\nge and actions are two wings. Some modern adwaitins erroneously argue: &quot;You=\r\n are That. There is nothing to do. Even the notion that you are bound and y=\r\nou need to do something to become free is an illusion. You ARE That and you=\r\n ARE free already.&quot; They de-emphasize action. But Vasishtha was clear. As I=\r\n showed in the other mail today, Sri Krishna also taught in Bhagavad Gita t=\r\nhat some actions aimed at paying off one&#39;s karmik debts are quite\n necessar=\r\ny and should never be given up as long one is embodied.\n\nIf you experience =\r\nfear or anxiety or like or dislike or pain or other such things in the fiel=\r\nd of duality at any time, you are not really thinking like &quot;That&quot;. The mean=\r\ning of being That is to be beyond such notions at *all* tismes.\n\n* * *\n\nLet=\r\n me give very simple and yet apt analogy.\n\nIf one is in a dream, there is n=\r\no point in coming in the dream and telling one &quot;this is just a dream. This =\r\nis not your natural state. Wake up&quot;. Merely asserting that to one in a drea=\r\nm will not wake one up from the dream! One will continue to be in the dream=\r\n. Even if one thinks &quot;this dream is not my real state. I am actually awake.=\r\n What I perceive is wakefulness&quot; , it will still be *in the dream*. One is =\r\nmerely awake *in the dream* and not really awake.\n\nIn order to really wake =\r\nup from the dream, some things need to happen in the dream. One can try to =\r\ndo some things in the dream that are likely to end the dream and wake one u=\r\np. Thus, the notion that it is not real and merely a dream and hence there =\r\nis no need to do anything is incorrect. Instead of doing stupid things and =\r\nprolonging a dream, one can do the right things and wake up soon.\n\nThus, en=\r\ngage in the right actions in the dream (that life in the field of duality i=\r\ns), to wake up to the reality (experience of Absolute at all times)!\n\n* * *=\r\n\n\nAs I mentioned in the other mail, constantly self-examine and contemplate=\r\n. Remove all thoughts of self-gratification, pride and expectation from oth=\r\ners from the mind. Catch such thoughts at the root and cut them off. Focus =\r\nyour energy on engaging in actions that *give* things to others and the uni=\r\nverse, without any considerations of self-gratification and with complete o=\r\nblivion to what you receive in return. Keep doing selfless actions without =\r\nany expectations. Eventually, your understanding will become perfect and yo=\r\nur actions will also become perfect. You will be free then.\n\n* * *\n\nBottoml=\r\nine: Both understanding and actions are needed. Actions accompanied by corr=\r\nect understanding are the key. As actions become more perfect and detached,=\r\n understanding becomes more perfect. As understanding becomes more perfect,=\r\n actions become more perfect and detached. At the end, when actions and und=\r\nerstanding become perfect, one becomes free. One then realizes that it was =\r\nall actually grace.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ homam\nSpirituality writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri ting=\r\ns\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nDo Pitri=\r\n Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n=\r\n&gt; Dear Narasimha -\n&gt; \n&gt; How does one get rid of this finiteness ?

In matters like this, one who takes offense is not\n&gt; &gt; wort=\r\nh apologizing to. One who has not taken offense, there is no need to\n&gt; &gt; ap=\r\nologize to that person.

Make it smaller and smaller.\n&gt; &gt; Reach a =\r\nstate when there is no fear or attraction or hatred for *anything*\n&gt; &gt; what=\r\nsoever at *any* time. It is good if such a thing happens at some times,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n but not good enough. When such an experience of absolute or nearness to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; absolute occurs temporarily, it can cause pride or false attachment to so=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt; things or even false detachment to some necessary things. However, t=\r\nhe good\n&gt; &gt; thing is that such an experience also tells one what is possibl=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The goal is to be in that state at all times. Until that is achi=\r\neved, so\n&gt; &gt; many karmas need to be performed by the ego. As I said, one ha=\r\ns to finish\n&gt; &gt; off the karmas that one signed up for. As one pays off more=\r\n and more of\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s karmik debts, one becomes freer and freer. But, unti=\r\nl one experiences\n&gt; &gt; absolute or nearness to absolute at all times, one is=\r\n not finished here!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The goal is to replace the finite personality w=\r\nith the Infinite. As long as\n&gt; &gt; the finite personality is present, even a =\r\nfleeting experience of Infinite\n&gt; &gt; becomes a source of pride, i.e. gets fi=\r\nnitized! Until the finite personality\n&gt; &gt; is replaced for ever by the Infin=\r\nite, there is more to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- &lt;delet=\r\ned&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On introspection , its clear =\r\nas you said that ego and I ness is central\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; established.

I hope you won&#39;t mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Background for othe=\r\nrs:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This gentleman had a telephone conversation with me a few days b=\r\nack. He is an advaitin. He was doing some rituals earlier. He happened to r=\r\nead &quot;I Am That&quot; book by Nisargadatta Maharaj, an adwaiti and a liberated ma=\r\nster. In the weeks after reading that book, he had a series of mystical exp=\r\neriences that revealed one idea after another to him. Based on his experien=\r\nces, he told me that all that we perceive is an illusion and even knowledge=\r\n and ignorance are illusions. Is there a need to perform rituals and why? T=\r\nhis whole thing is like a dream and why do we need to do specific things in=\r\n what we know to be a dream?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I mostly listened to what he was saying=\r\n without saying anything, but said a few things at the end. He said that he=\r\n\n sees everything for what it is during an experience, but back to normal a=\r\nt the end of it, e.g. worried about a sore throat and stuff like that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;I told him that that state of not having fear or likes or dislikes has t=\r\no be permanent and not a fleeting experience. I told him it is good to say =\r\nduality is an illusion, but one needs to deal with it when one is immersed =\r\nin that illusion most of the time. A fleeting experience of reality and imm=\r\nersion in the illusion again is not liberation. One needs to strive for a s=\r\ntate when one is in that state all the time. To reach that state, it is nec=\r\nessary to pay back one&#39;s karmik debts in the field of duality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I tol=\r\nd him that rituals like homam can be performed without an individual sankal=\r\npa, but just for the pleasure of the deity. Thus, one ends up giving someth=\r\ning to the universe without considering whether and what one gets in return=\r\n. That is conducive to freedom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He pondered on my words for a\n few d=\r\nays and replied. I will continue the discussion below with him on the list =\r\nnow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your question is a very important one and addresse=\r\nd by many scriptures such as Upanishads, Yoga Vaasishtham, Bhagavad Gita et=\r\nc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vasishtha taught in Yoga Vaasishtham that knowledge (understandin=\r\ng) and action are the two wings with which the bird of soul flies. It is no=\r\nt possible for one wing to reach the correct speed at once. As the wings ar=\r\ne flapped, one wing will take off, the other will take off accordingly, the=\r\n first wing gains more speed and so on. Eventually, when there is balance b=\r\netween the two wings, bird flies off.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perfect understanding and perf=\r\nect actions do not come by themselves suddenly. Actions and understanding w=\r\nork together, balance each other and improve each other.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One can sta=\r\nrt off with some understanding and engage in actions that imbibe that under=\r\nstanding. As one engages in more and more actions that are\n aligned with on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s understanding becomes better and better. As one&#39;s underst=\r\nanding becomes better and better, it enables actions that are more and more=\r\n aligned with one&#39;s dharma. Better understanding results in better actions =\r\nand better actions result in better understanding. You cannot separate know=\r\nledge from actions. As I said, Vasishtha was very clear that knowledge and =\r\nactions are two wings. Some modern adwaitins erroneously argue: &quot;You are Th=\r\nat. There is nothing to do. Even the notion that you are bound and you need=\r\n to do something to become free is an illusion. You ARE That and you ARE fr=\r\nee already.&quot; They de-emphasize action. But Vasishtha was clear. As I showed=\r\n in the other mail today, Sri Krishna also taught in Bhagavad Gita that som=\r\ne actions aimed at paying off one&#39;s karmik debts are quite necessary and sh=\r\nould never be given up as long one is embodied.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you experience fe=\r\nar or anxiety or like or dislike or pain or other\n such things in the field=\r\n of duality at any time, you are not really thinking like &quot;That&quot;. The meani=\r\nng of being That is to be beyond such notions at *all* tismes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me give very simple and yet apt analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one is in a =\r\ndream, there is no point in coming in the dream and telling one &quot;this is ju=\r\nst a dream. This is not your natural state. Wake up&quot;. Merely asserting that=\r\n to one in a dream will not wake one up from the dream! One will continue t=\r\no be in the dream. Even if one thinks &quot;this dream is not my real state. I a=\r\nm actually awake. What I perceive is wakefulness&quot; , it will still be *in th=\r\ne dream*. One is merely awake *in the dream* and not really awake.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\nn order to really wake up from the dream, some things need to happen in the=\r\n dream. One can try to do some things in the dream that are likely to end t=\r\nhe dream and wake one up. Thus, the notion that it is not real and merely a=\r\n dream and hence there is no need to do\n anything is incorrect. Instead of =\r\ndoing stupid things and prolonging a dream, one can do the right things and=\r\n wake up soon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, engage in the right actions in the dream (that =\r\nlife in the field of duality is), to wake up to the reality (experience of =\r\nAbsolute at all times)!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I mentioned in the other mai=\r\nl, constantly self-examine and contemplate. Remove all thoughts of self-gra=\r\ntification, pride and expectation from others from the mind. Catch such tho=\r\nughts at the root and cut them off. Focus your energy on engaging in action=\r\ns that *give* things to others and the universe, without any considerations=\r\n of self-gratification and with complete oblivion to what you receive in re=\r\nturn. Keep doing selfless actions without any expectations. Eventually, you=\r\nr understanding will become perfect and your actions will also become perfe=\r\nct. You will be free then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline: Both understandi=\r\nng and actions are needed.\n Actions accompanied by correct understanding ar=\r\ne the key. As actions become more perfect and detached, understanding becom=\r\nes more perfect. As understanding becomes more perfect, actions become more=\r\n perfect and detached. At the end, when actions and understanding become pe=\r\nrfect, one becomes free. One then realizes that it was all actually grace.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas =\r\nYourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- &lt;dele=\r\nted&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; How does one get =\r\nrid of this finiteness ?

In matters like this, one who takes offense is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; worth =\r\napologizing to. One who has not taken offense, there is no need to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; apologize to that person. Either way, apology is irrelevant!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ego or I-ness is the driver all the time. Make it smaller =\r\nand smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Reach a state when there is no fear or attraction=\r\n or hatred for *anything*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; whatsoever at *any* time. It is good=\r\n if such a thing happens at some times,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but not good enough. W=\r\nhen such an experience of absolute or nearness to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; absolute occ=\r\nurs temporarily, it can cause pride or false attachment to some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; things or even false detachment to some necessary things. However, the go=\r\nod&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thing is that such an experience also tells one\n what is po=\r\nssible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The goal is to be in that state at all ti=\r\nmes. Until that is achieved, so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; many karmas need to be perform=\r\ned by the ego. As I said, one has to finish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; off the karmas tha=\r\nt one signed up for. As one pays off more and more of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s ka=\r\nrmik debts, one becomes freer and freer. But, until one experiences&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; absolute or nearness to absolute at all times, one is not finished he=\r\nre!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The goal is to replace the finite personality=\r\n with the Infinite. As long as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the finite personality is prese=\r\nnt, even a fleeting experience of Infinite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; becomes a source of=\r\n pride, i.e. gets finitized! Until the finite personality&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is r=\r\neplaced for ever by the Infinite, there is more to do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- &lt;del=\r\neted&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha\n -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; On introspection , its clear as you said that ego and I ness i=\r\ns central&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; established.
