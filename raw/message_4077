It is a highly flexible metre. There is no requirement on each syllable to be short/long. But Bhujanga prayaata is a vritta, i.e. the exact sequence of short and long syllables is fixed. So it has a fixed rhythm.\n \nThe rule for Bhujanga Prayaata metre is:\n \n&quot;bhujaMga prayaataM chaturbhir yakaaraiH&quot;\n \nIt means &quot;Bhujanga Prayaata is with 4 ya&#39;s&quot;. Ya group is formed with one laghu, one guru and one guru (i.e. short-long-long), in that order. For example, &quot;nirIsham&quot; has 3 syllables (&quot;ni-rI-shaM&quot;) and fits the pattern of short-long-long. You put 4 such ya-groups together and you get one line of Bhujanga Prayaata. There are 4 such lines.\n \nBhujanga Prayaata literally means &quot;going of a snake&quot;. The pattern &quot;lalAlA-lalAlA-lalAlA-lalAlA&quot; has a movement kind of similar to the curvy movement of a snake. That may be why it is named thus.\n \nHowever, at a subtler level, please note that different sound patterns create different awareness in the consciousness when it focuses on the sound pattern and loses track of everything else (other than that sound). When mind is filled with 100s and 1000s of thoughts, one does not experience a mantra or its deity. To let the mantra and its deity occupy the mind, one needs to create a vacuum for them in the mind. When other thoughts cease in the mind and mind reverberates with a mantra alone, that is when mantra and its deity &quot;fill&quot; the mind and one &quot;experiences&quot; them. What the sound pattern of a Bhujanga Prayaata metre does to the consciousness when it succeeds in a perfect focus can be guessed from the name - movement of which symbolic snake?\n \n*        *        *\n \nToday is Pournima and the day of my monthly Satya Narayana vratam. Satya Narayana is Truth personified, starting from low level truths till the highest Truth that all is God. Today is an auspicious day for worshipping the god of Truth.

R. Ramachander\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Bhujanga prayata is a meter for writing poems in Sanskrit. It means moving of a snake. Adi Shankara has written several prayers using this meter. There is a very interesting story about this stotra. Adi Shankara reached his mother&#39;s death bed before she died. He wanted to help her get salvation. So he composed a great stotra called Shiva Bhujanga Prayata Stotra in praise of Lord Shiva. As soon as it was completed, The servants of Lord Shiva came to take Shankara&#39;s mother to heaven. But she was terrified to see them, because they wore the dresses of the forest and dressed in tiger skin with belts of snakes. Understanding her problem, Shankara humbly requested the servants of Lord Shiva to go back and composed this prayer to Lord Vishnu in the Bhujanga prayata meter. Once he recited it, the servants of Lord Vishnu, who had polished God like looks came to accompany Shankara&#39;s mother to heaven. She was extremely pleased to go with them.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chidamsam vibhum nirmalam nirvikalpam,\n&gt; &gt; Nireeham nirakaramongara gamyam,\n&gt; &gt; Gunatheetha mavyakthamekam thureeyam,\n&gt; &gt; Param brahma yam Veda thasmai namosthu. 1\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Salutations to that God who is called that which is beyond Brahmam by Vedas,\n&gt; &gt; Who is the Lord of the animated principle of life, who is clarity, who never dies,\n&gt; &gt; Who does not have desire, who does not have form, who is known in Om,\n&gt; &gt; Who is beyond three qualities, who is not clear, who is one and who is thureeya*.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vishuddham shivam santham adhyandha heenam,\n&gt; &gt; Jagajjevanam jyothir ananda roopam,\n&gt; &gt; Adhigdesakala vyavachadaneeyam,\n&gt; &gt; Thrayeevakthi yam veda thasmai namosthu. 2\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My salutations to him who is told as trinity by Vedas,\n&gt; &gt; Who is pure, who is peaceful, who is patient,\n&gt; &gt; Who does not have beginning or end,\n&gt; &gt; And whose limits cannot be fixed by stature or time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Samanodhithaneka suryendu koti,\n&gt; &gt; Prabha poora thulya dyuthim durnireeksham,\n&gt; &gt; Na seetham na cha ushnam suvarnavadatham,\n&gt; &gt; Prasannam sadananda samvith swaroopam. 3\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He has the form having the dazzling light,\n&gt; &gt; Of billions of moon and sun all rising together,\n&gt; &gt; Which is difficult to be seen by the eye,\n&gt; &gt; Having no heat nor cold and as pretty as gold,\n&gt; &gt; And is always happy and pleased .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sunasaputam sundarabrulalatam,\n&gt; &gt; Kireetochithakunchitha snigdha kesam,\n&gt; &gt; Spurathpundareekabhi ramayathaksham,\n&gt; &gt; Samuthphulla raktha prasoonavathamsam. 4\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He has very pretty nose and eyelids,\n&gt; &gt; He has very wide and pretty forehead,\n&gt; &gt; He has curled hair over which there is a crown,\n&gt; &gt; He has eyes as pretty as the petals of lotus,\n&gt; &gt; And wears the red hibiscus flower as ornament.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sphurathath kundala mrushta ganda sthalantham,\n&gt; &gt; Japarogachoradharam charu hasam,\n&gt; &gt; Aali vyakula modha mandhara malam,\n&gt; &gt; Mahora sphurath kousthubhodhara haram. 5\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His shining ear drops dash against his pretty neck,\n&gt; &gt; His red hibiscus coloured lips open for a pretty smile,\n&gt; &gt; He attracts the bees because of the flower garland he wears,\n&gt; &gt; And his chest shines because of garland and kousthuba gem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surathnanga dwairanvitham bahu dandai,\n&gt; &gt; Chathurbhischalath kanakanalankruthagrai,\n&gt; &gt; Udharodharankrutham peetha vasthram,\n&gt; &gt; Pada dwandwa nirdhootha padmabhiramam. 6\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He wears armlets made of pretty gems on his arms,\n&gt; &gt; He decorates his four arms by wearing golden bangles,\n&gt; &gt; He ties yellow silk cloth over his sto\n\n\n"}}
