But, in my \nview, pournaanika mantra by Veda Vyasa (neelaanjana samaabhaasam) is \nbetter for most people without proficiency in Sanskrit.\n\n*        *        *\n\nJust as one cannot pay off a thousand dollar loan with a one dollar \nbill, similarly sufferings from serious karmas cannot be annulled with \njust one ritual. Any practice yields results with regularity. There are \nthousands of people now, who are doing a homam daily or weekly and \nexperiencing the material and spiritual benefits. A one-off homam may \nnot do anything tangible, but a homam done daily or weekly can do \nsomething. But it is good beginning and all the best!\n\n*        *        *\n\nIt is fashionable today to look down upon rituals and give empty talks \non high philosophy. Ritualism and high philosophy are reconcicled and \nexplained in the white paper presented at World Association of VEdic \nStudies (WAVES) 2010 conference:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/homamwhy\n\n*        *        *\n\nIt is not without a reason that fire had a prominent place in many \nancient religions. Fire is a living representative of god on earth. It \nhas a very powerful influence on one&#39;s consciousness and accelerates the \npurging of bad samskaras (through which planets give us troubles). There \nis no need to take someone&#39;s words for it - if one spends some time with \nfire on a regular basis, one will know this for oneself.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sunder Rangarajan&quot; \n&lt;sunder.rangarajan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello All,\n&gt; I am going through Shani Mahadasa from June-2001 which I must admit \n&gt; has  been very difficult for me so far....To please Shanidev I am \n&gt; planning to do Shani Homam tomorrow.....It is a do-it-yourself homam \n&gt; which I found in Narsimha Raoji&#39;s site here-\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/\n&gt;\n&gt; Any feedback/suggestions?????\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sunder Rangarajan\n\n"}}
