Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc=\r\n.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. with that logic, those people wh=\r\no choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. ev=\r\nen people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and not d=\r\noing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\n&gt; &gt; To talk about Karma, C=\r\nonditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the logi=\r\nc of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well wi=\r\nth me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.\n&gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultur=\r\nes have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved.

My point is, as a =\r\nnon-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to pla=\r\nnts, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=83=E2=80=9A this logic t=\r\nhat many vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to qu=\r\nit eating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I perso=\r\nnally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pat=\r\nhetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting o=\r\nf throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cr=\r\nuelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the huma=\r\nns that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which come=\r\ns out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have p=\r\nroper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and t=\r\nhen the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do=\r\n not share them. Call me cruel hearted. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When =\r\nthe question of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for su=\r\nch. It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained=\r\n about may not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetarian fri=\r\nends were watching discovery channel where they showed that people in some =\r\nparts of the world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, =\r\n&quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A if=\r\n someone eats an insect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a ce=\r\nrtain culture in a certain set of value, one gets the believe that what one=\r\n is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life ti=\r\nme they were to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eating insect=\r\ns without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible pro=\r\nduct of our own conditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the proble=\r\nm happens when we think our conditions are the only possible conditioning i=\r\nn the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. =\r\nThat is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is. Ever=\r\nything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life=\r\n, if he gets born in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid whi=\r\nle eating the same. I know=C3=83=E2=80=9A people who faint at the sight of =\r\nblood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations daily. So my point =\r\nis, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an individual, but i=\r\nt=C3=83=E2=80=9A cannot be=C3=83=E2=80=9A a universal logic applicable to a=\r\nll.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the=\r\n idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly kill=\r\ning an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys de=\r\nad meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if so=\r\nmeone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=E2=80=9A does not want to deal in the raw fl=\r\nesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that y=\r\nou would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple daa=\r\nl which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who has ch=\r\neated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in =\r\nall food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broil=\r\ner eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten becaus=\r\ne they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma d=\r\noes one get for consuming that? God\n knows.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; An=\r\n average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an om=\r\nnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and =\r\n20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good combina=\r\ntion. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple =\r\ndiet, are prone to serious heath issues at a younger age. But this 80-20 ve=\r\ng/non-veg, is biologically good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be full of fi=\r\nshes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable=\r\n if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not, put up=\r\n such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they are themselves not=\r\n convinced.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The above arguments are incorrect.

Panting for water (i don&#39;t have=\r\n proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and=\r\n then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottom line is that =\r\n&quot;They cannot overcome&quot; the cravings for the meat, fish and eggs.

Only at the cold places and dese=\r\nrts where survival was the main consideration, i can slightly agree but tha=\r\nt too during ancient days. not now...Now everywhere Veg food is easily avai=\r\nlable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Few months back, a young girl from Germany ca=\r\nme to work in my office for 6 months. once i casually asked her as to what =\r\nshe eats during lunch. what she said was not at all expected. she said that=\r\n she is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg food since 3 years now and wants =\r\nto continue that way whole life. As expected, i was very happy and i furthe=\r\nr asked the reason. The answer she gave so much happiness. She said that Sh=\r\ne does not want to kill to eat. Vow! I salute her from my heart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear U=\r\ntpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I s=\r\nlightly disagree with your below mail.

Yesterday evening i went to a=\r\n mall along with some family friends. Occasion being my marriage anniversar=\r\ny.&nbsp;&nbsp;One senior friend, whom i respect very much, who is also&nbsp=\r\n;a vegetarian, suddenly started arguments with me on the&nbsp;same topic. H=\r\ne was&nbsp;arguing from the Nonveg point of view. In short, he was saying&n=\r\nbsp;by giving examples that People who meat are also very gentle, polite an=\r\nd good natured.&nbsp; They are not Tamasik and such arguments. &lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;I again reiterated my view. I told him that&nbsp;i do not say that t=\r\nhe people who eat meat are *Bad* people. I do not also claim that Pure vegg=\r\nies are all and always *Good* people.&nbsp; Infact, i have a couple of very=\r\n good friends who are meat eater and they are really good human beings. &lt;SP=\r\nAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;I only say\n that the people who eat meat are not doing the =\r\nright Karma because the act results in to cold blooded killing/ butchering =\r\n/ massacre of innocent Creatures. I only say that for eating (actually sati=\r\nsfying cravings of palate), one has no right to harm the other life.&lt;/SPAN&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Georgia&quot;&gt;We both k=\r\nept quite for a while and then i suddenly saw a advertisement poster of Mon=\r\nt blank pen on which Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s picture was shown&nbsp;with&nbsp;one =\r\nof his thought and signature.

My only point in&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (=\r\nNon\n Violence)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is =\r\ngood to eat totally vegetarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially t=\r\nhings like havans, or else it conflicts with your system badly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; In my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct will =\r\nremain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if Not right then for me i=\r\nt&#39;ll remain *Not right in all conditions*. it is a different matter, if in =\r\nfuture i succumb to challanging conditions and start eating meat but even t=\r\nhen it&#39;ll not justify and make it proper thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get offended by my message. i apolog=\r\nise in advance for my bluntness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your second Para and some wri=\r\ntings in your earlier message gives me impression that you are heavily phil=\r\nosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very\n honest=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chi=\r\ncken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. with that logic, those =\r\npeople who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly al=\r\nright. even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable =\r\nand not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To t=\r\nalk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality judg=\r\nements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; d=\r\noes not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nPoeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they hate kill=\r\ning invloved. I gave an example of one such person and there are few more i=\r\n know. howvever they are very very very rare.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n The above arguments are incorrect. I know some non-vegetarian people who p=\r\nrovide such arguements, but these arguments are nonsensical\n and childish. =\r\nAlmost Zakir Naik style of arguments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree completely. it i=\r\ns childish, Laughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it when such p=\r\neople talk such nonsense.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Lastly, i&#39;ll add a =\r\nphilospohical thought. If so much of killing every hourly basis, mostly for=\r\n the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the prime mover is=\r\n Human society, then how we hope to have a peacefull world without blood sh=\r\ned and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cause &amp; effect) will find man=\r\ny ways to give it back to (in)Human societies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Om Shaanti Shaa=\r\nnti Shaanti:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. c=\r\nom, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI hope you or others won&#39;t get offended by my mails.

No. All I am saying is th=\r\nat,=C3=83=E2=80=9A this logic that many vegetarian people provide to convin=\r\nce average non-veg people to quit eating non-veg, does not hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally can not look a=\r\nt butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site.

The flash of so cruelly butchered Chi=\r\ncken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just o=\r\nverlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is s=\r\nuch a disturbing site.

My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. I=\r\nf you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A if someone =\r\neats an insect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain cul=\r\nture in a certain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not a=\r\nccustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they w=\r\nere to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without=\r\n the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of o=\r\nur own conditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens=\r\n when we think our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the wor=\r\nld, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is i=\r\nncorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is. Everything is=\r\n desh-kaal-patra.

So my poi=\r\nnt is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an individual, bu=\r\nt it=C3=83=E2=80=9A cannot be=C3=83=E2=80=9A a universal logic applicable t=\r\no all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A far better an=\r\ngle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make s=\r\nure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be=\r\n killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be han=\r\ndled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=E2=80=9A does not=\r\n want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food.=\r\n The amount of karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It c=\r\nan be easily handled.=C3=83=E2=80=9A It is similar to the one you\n would ge=\r\nt for buying some simple daal which has come to the market through the hand=\r\ns of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There=\r\n is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable.=\r\n There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are=\r\n designed to be eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like d=\r\nead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming that? God knows.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; An average non-vegetarian,=\r\n at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple die=\r\nt consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From=\r\n a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who feed on=\r\n more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to serio=\r\nus heath issues at a younger age.
