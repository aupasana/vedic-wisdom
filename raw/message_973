Shriram Sharma Acharya=\r\n\n\nDear ALL,\n\n\n*Vedic Sanskars : Influence Chromosomes -1** *\n\nAs per the re=\r\nsearch findings of the modern sciences, the current civilized\nand developed=\r\n state of man is a result of a long series of evolutionary\nchanges. This ha=\r\ns taken about 400 to 500 thousand years for the ascent of\nhuman race to the=\r\n present state and women have made significant\ncontributions in civilizing =\r\nthe primeval humans. This important role played\nby women is getting clearer=\r\n and better established by the discoveries in the\nfield of human genomics.\n=\r\n\nIt is a well-known scientific fact that offsprings acquire good and bad\nqu=\r\nalities of their ancestors through the chromosomes. The language of genes\nw=\r\nritten in the chromosomes of the cells of the offspring determines his/her\n=\r\nform, color, body structure and other attributes and characteristics. The\nc=\r\nells in human body have 46 chromosomes. Among these, 23 chromosomes come\nfr=\r\nom the mother and the other 23 come from the father. On one side these\nchro=\r\nmosomes display the specific qualities and attributes of the offspring,\nand=\r\n on the other side they also determine whether or not the offspring would\nb=\r\ne afflicted by any of the 2000 diseases that have been considered as\ngeneti=\r\nc. These include several kinds of cancers and other fatal ailments.\n\nThe cr=\r\neator of this world has written specific messages in the chemical\nlanguage =\r\nof chromosomes. About 32.5 million letters of these genetic codes\nhave been=\r\n read and the human genome (compendium of genes) has been made\navailable on=\r\n the Internet. However, only about 40 thousand genes of these\nhave been ide=\r\nntified till date. It is still not known what kinds of roles\nmost of these =\r\ngenes play in the human body. Till date about 95 percent of\nthe genome is u=\r\nncharacterized and because of the redundancy of its sequence\nacross the hum=\r\nan population, many researchers consider that they are not of\nany significa=\r\nnt use in Nature&#39;s molecular machinery.\n\nBut thinkers and scientists who lo=\r\nok at the aspects of human consciousness with\nequanimity do not agree with =\r\nthis view. The wise men who have faith in\nsynergy of science and spirituali=\r\nty believe that extrasensory capabilities\nand the secrets of spiritual powe=\r\nrs may be hidden within these 95 percent\nunknown DNAs (Deoxyribose Nucleic =\r\nAcid). It is known that DNA is that super\nchemical which forms a letter of =\r\nthe genomic language by picking up any\nthree of the four nucleotides =96 Ad=\r\nenine (A), Thiamine (T), Guanine (G), and\nCytosine (C). Definite sequences =\r\nof these letters constitute a word in the\nform of 20 amino acids. A gene is=\r\n that sentence which translates into some\nform of protein or the other. For=\r\n this reason after human genomics, research\nis now being carried out on hum=\r\nan proteomics in which Indian scientists are\nalso participating.\n\nAmong the=\r\n 23 pairs of chromosomes in human body, X- and Y-chromosomes are\nincluded w=\r\nhich determine sex. If the foetus receives one X and one Y\nchromosome, it t=\r\nakes the form and shape of a boy and if both the chromosomes\nare X then the=\r\n foetus takes the form of a girl. Woman always has X-X\nchromosomes so she c=\r\nontributes X chromosomes only and Y chromosome exists in\nman&#39;s body only. S=\r\no man plays a decisive role in determining whether the\noffspring would be a=\r\n boy or a girl.\n\nIt has now been established by scientific research that th=\r\ne diversified\nquality of creativity that exists in human race has its origi=\r\nn in woman.\nAccording to this, the source of creativity in human beings is =\r\nthe X\nchromosome, which is the mother&#39;s contribution. How did it happen tha=\r\nt\nboundless human capabilities of art and science got tied up in the X\nchro=\r\nmosome? This might have something to do with the natural power of\ncreation =\r\ngifted to the women and the inference, drawn by evolutionary\nstatisticians =\r\nthat most of the bright and talented men and women choose only\ncompatible c=\r\nounterparts so the genetic recombination in the mating process\nwould have l=\r\ned to compounded accumulation of these qualities within the X\nchromosome. I=\r\nn fact, all men and women have X chromosomes. Women have two\nand men have o=\r\nne X chromosome, meaning that within each person infinite\ncapabilities of c=\r\nreativity exist, but these blossom up only when they are\nnurtured with good=\r\n education, virtuous sanskara (deep mental impressions)\nand conducive envir=\r\nonment.\nIN any case the hypothesis appears valid that if women had not accu=\r\nmulated\nthe genes of creativity within their X chromosomes, human beings wo=\r\nuld still\nbe jumping around in jungles like monkeys and the glorious flower=\r\ns of\ncivilization and culture would never have blossomed in human life. In =\r\nview\nof the recent finding of a direct relationship between mental disorder=\r\ns and\nthe X chromosome it appears that most of the mental disorders are als=\r\no\ntransmitted by the mother into her offspring via her X chromosome. A\nrese=\r\narch hypothesis was proposed 30 years back by Dr. Robert Lehrke at the\nBrai=\r\nnerd State Hospital located in Brainerd, Minnesota, USA, that several\ngenes=\r\n that are related to human intellect are located within the X\nchromosome.\n\n=\r\nNoted geneticists Dr Horst Hameister and U. Zechner from Germany have\nconfi=\r\nrmed the above hypothesis by their research work and have published\ntheir r=\r\nesults in the 17th edition of &#39;Trends in Genetics&#39;. According to\nthem, for =\r\nthe developed state the human mind is in today, humanity is\nindebted to tho=\r\nse great X chromosome bearing women who chose intelligent,\nhandsome and bra=\r\nve men not for their outward appearance and strength but for\ntheir virtues,=\r\n knowledge and intelligence. If they had kept on choosing\nstupid but handso=\r\nme men or unintelligent bodybuilders then humans would not\nhave been able t=\r\no post so many records in the areas of knowledge and science\nwhich they con=\r\ntinue to do now. In their research conclusions they write that\nthose genes =\r\nwhose abnormal condition creates mental disorders, their normal\n(homologous=\r\n to those in the healthy people) form would be responsible for\nthe normal s=\r\ntate of human mind too.\n\nThis group of researchers, after extensive churnin=\r\ng of the genomic database\nfrom the Internet, has found 958 genes, which are=\r\n related to mental\ndisorders, and 202 of these were related to the X chromo=\r\nsome. Though this\namounts to just 4 percent of all the human genome, the la=\r\nrgest number of\ngenes related to mental disorders and physical abnormalitie=\r\ns were found on\nthe X chromosomes only. The genes responsible for these abn=\r\normalities were\nfound 2.5 times more on the X chromosomes as compared to an=\r\ny other\nchromosomes. At the same time all these genes were not in their ori=\r\nginal\nform (as in people with healthy minds) but in an altered or mutated f=\r\norm.\nHowever if they were in their original form they would have produced a=\r\n\nnormal child. Even if these kinds of genes are distributed over all 23\nchr=\r\nomosomes, the genes related to mental ailments are present almost 31\ntimes =\r\nmore on the X chromosome.\n\nThus the secrets of the future of a child are la=\r\nrgely hidden in the genes\nand womb of its mother. To ensure that the state =\r\nof the genes on X\nchromosomes is fertile for the best characteristics (trai=\r\nts) it is necessary\nthat desirable food and lifestyle, sanskara and ambienc=\r\ne be provided to the\n&#39;would be mothers&#39;. Of the sixteen Vedic Sacraments (S=\r\nhodas Sanskars1)\npropounded by the rishis, the Punsavan and Jatkarma Sanska=\r\nrs for the\nexpectant mothers are meant for this very purpose. These are dev=\r\nised with\nthe sublime scientific view of conditioning the genetic environme=\r\nnt.\n\nThe Shodas Sanskaras are excellent experiments on sadhana and mantra- =\r\nand\nyagya- therapy; the rituals and teachings implied by them are also aime=\r\nd at\ncreating appropriate ambience and effectuate psychological conditionin=\r\ng of\nthe persons whose sanskara is being performed. The Charu (an Ayurvedic=\r\n\npreparation with milk + special kinds of herbs) cooked in yagya fire and\n&#39;=\r\ntreated&#39; with mantras during the Punsavan and Jatkarma Samskars is also\nreq=\r\nuired to be drunk by the mother afterwards. This is assumed to have\nsoothin=\r\ng effects on the growing brain and overall health of the foetus.\nAccording =\r\nto the experts of the deep knowledge of Himalayan herbs/plant\nmedicines and=\r\n yagya therapy, some special charus, medicinal woods and plant\nmedicines al=\r\nso have potentials to rectify genetic aberrations. Thoughtful\nmen and women=\r\n who aspire for children who would grow up into ideal citizens\nmust underst=\r\nand this fact and must not delay or procrastinate in adopting\nthe life styl=\r\nes propounded by the ancient Indian sages.\n\n*1.

So man plays a decisive role in determining whether the offs=\r\npring would be a boy or a girl. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;It has now been established by sci=\r\nentific research that the diversified quality of creativity that exists in =\r\nhuman race has its origin in woman.
