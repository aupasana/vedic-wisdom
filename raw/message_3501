Immediately upon my\n=\r\narrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the place. On August\n15=\r\nth of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of\nt=\r\nhree times in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother=\r\n\nto be powerful spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability=\r\n\nto work on the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible\nma=\r\nnner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his or the\nMo=\r\nther&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n\nWhile I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I =\r\nmet Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\ndisciple of both Aurobindo and Ganapati M=\r\nuni. As he was now and then\nvisiting Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe to=\r\n me the Maharshi and his\nashrama. His intriguing descriptions, along with t=\r\nhe reading of B. V.\nNarasimhaswami&#39;s biography of the Maharshi, is what pro=\r\nmpted my first visit\nto Ramanasramam in 1933.\n\nBefore this second visit to =\r\nRamanasramam I once again read Bhagavan&#39;s\nbiography. In it I found a passag=\r\ne relating to the possibility of changing\none&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about t=\r\nhis and addressed it to the Maharshi. He\ntold me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can =\r\nchange his guru. What of that?&quot;\n\nIn Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a =\r\nlarge extent, was regulated and\ncontrolled. For instance, even to take a si=\r\nmple trip into town we had to\nobtain permission. In contrast, here in Raman=\r\nasramam it was totally\ndifferent. I experienced a liberating feeling of fre=\r\nedom, informality and\nspontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the sam=\r\ne time elevating.\n\nAlso, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally per=\r\nmitted to visit all\nother saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Ma=\r\nharshi and Sri\nRamanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the powe=\r\nr to undo years\nof spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo were=\r\n effecting on the\npsyche of their followers. In other words, they considere=\r\nd the Maharshi too\npowerful an influence. Bhagavan was aware of this and on=\r\nce when I was alone\nwith him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. They a=\r\nre afraid of me.&quot;\n\nLeaving Aurobindo Ashram\n\nI had been with the Mother and=\r\n Aurobindo for five years. During those years\nthey showered me with kindnes=\r\ns and love, while guiding me on the spiritual\npath. My gratitude and regard=\r\n for them compelled me to obtain their\npermission and blessings before leav=\r\ning. This turned out to be much more\ndifficult than I imagined.\n\nIn Aurobin=\r\ndo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or\nquestions=\r\n to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the\nletters we=\r\nre daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with the\nMother du=\r\nring the nights and promptly answer them in writing. Sometimes we\nwould see=\r\n the lights burning all night as they were engaged in this work.\n\nUpon my r=\r\neturn from Ramanasramam I wrote a letter stating my desire to\nreceive their=\r\n blessings and permission to live at Ramanasramam. In the\nletter to Aurobin=\r\ndo I wrote that since your yoga begins with\nSelf-realization, kindly permit=\r\n me to go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes\nonly Self-realization, a state =\r\nI have not attained, or may not even be\nworthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s re=\r\nply was affectionate, but negative in\nregards to my leaving his ashram. He =\r\nwrote, &quot;Both Self-realization and the\nsupra-mental state can be simultaneou=\r\nsly developed and achieved here. There\nis no need for you to go there.&quot;\n\nI =\r\nwas extremely disappointed at his response and consequently became\nfrustrat=\r\ned, restless and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights\nand fel=\r\nt distraught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same\nreque=\r\nst. Again I was denied permission. It took a long five months and a\nthird l=\r\netter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their\npermi=\r\nssion and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and\nthey =\r\nsaw no other recourse but to grant my request.\n\nIn Aurobindo&#39;s final letter=\r\n to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\nfollow a path in which you ca=\r\nn achieve only partial realization, we give you\nour blessings, though we be=\r\nlieve it would be better if you stayed on here\nand pursued your sadhana whe=\r\nre both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;\n\nIt was the rule in Aurobindo Ashra=\r\nm that any letter written to or received\nfrom Aurobindo should not leave th=\r\ne ashram premises. So, to comply with this\nrule, I burnt all my letters, ex=\r\ncept the final letter I received from\nAurobindo. This I kept with the view =\r\nof showing it to Bhagavan.\n\nSettling at Sri Ramanasramam\n\nDuring the early =\r\nyears there were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it\nwas mostly jungl=\r\ne or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a\nbrahmin&#39;s house near =\r\nthe Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would\nsometimes cook small it=\r\nems in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere\noutside, and somehow m=\r\nanage without feeling inconvenienced.\n\nDaily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a=\r\n.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the\nhall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., retu=\r\nrn to my room, come back again to the\nashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until=\r\n 8 p.m. It went on like this during the\nfirst year. If possible, I would al=\r\nways sit close to Bhagavan so I could\nhear all of his precious utterances.\n=\r\n\nS. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that th=\r\ne\nYogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness. Consequently, one day he\n=\r\ntravelled to Pondicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\ndescribi=\r\nng who he was, what he wanted from life (Self-realization) and where\nhe was=\r\n then residing (Sri Ramanasramam). Cohen later showed me the reply he\ngot f=\r\nrom Aurobindo. It said, in brief, that all his aspirations could be\nfulfill=\r\ned at Sri Ramanasramam, where he was then living.\n\nI remember during my sec=\r\nond visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day\nreading a lengthy book r=\r\neview from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was\nAurobindo&#39;s Lights on Y=\r\noga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of\nthis newspaper was Bh=\r\nagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take\ngreat interest in t=\r\nhe review and would occasionally stop reading and comment\non what he had ju=\r\nst read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded\nreading it, some=\r\none who was aware that I had that very book with me, said to\nBhagavan, &quot;Thi=\r\ns man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book\nwith him.&quot; Bh=\r\nagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\nlook at it.&quot;\n\n=\r\nI went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over to Bhagavan.\nIm=\r\nmediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He kept on reading it well\nin=\r\nto the night, with the help of a small oil lamp, until he finished it.\n\nWhe=\r\nn I came into the hall the next day he began discussing the book with me,\nt=\r\nelling me that a certain term used in the book might look like something\nne=\r\nw, but it is actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and\nsu=\r\nch ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing\nAurobi=\r\nndo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood\nAurobindo&#39;=\r\ns philosophy both intellectually and also from the standpoint of\nexperience=\r\n.\n\nOne evening I said to Bhagavan that the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n=\r\nteachings is that it professes that immortality of the body can be achieved=\r\n.\nBhagavan made no comment.\n\nThe next day, as soon as I walked into the hal=\r\nl and sat down, Bhagavan\nlooked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam the=\r\nre was one yogi, C. V. V.\nRao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of =\r\nthe immortality of the\nbody. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Ann=\r\nie Besant (a\ndistinguished public and spiritual personality in India) would=\r\n have to come\nto him to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he=\r\n had a chance\nto meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly =\r\nillustrated his\npoint.\n\nOn another day, not too long after settling near Sr=\r\ni Ramanasramam, I\napproached Bhagavan when no one was in the hall and showe=\r\nd him that last\nletter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to =\r\ngive it to him to\nread. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo=\r\n&#39;s handwriting, as\nit was very illegible and only those who have studied it=\r\n for sometime could\nread it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n\nAfter l=\r\nooking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he\nreturne=\r\nd it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came\nto the=\r\n sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can\nachi=\r\neve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,\n&quot;Partial=\r\n realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it is\nrealiza=\r\ntion, it is not partial.&quot;\n\nThis was the final blow that silenced all my dou=\r\nbts. I then destroyed this\nletter, like all the rest. And because of all th=\r\ne discussions I had had with\nBhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in =\r\nhis teachings, having a clear\nunderstanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path an=\r\nd Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\nwent different ways. When all the clouds of=\r\n doubts and distractions\ndispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then k=\r\nnew that I understood and\nthe foundation work had been done. The purpose of=\r\n all our discussions were\nserved and so they stopped automatically.\n\nI beli=\r\neve the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan was the power of his\npresenc=\r\ne. Much of what he taught had already been transmitted to the masses\ndown t=\r\nhrough the ages. In Bhagavan we found a being that was surcharged with\nthe =\r\nReality to such an extent that coming into his presence would effect a\ndram=\r\natic change in us.\n\nSources:\n\na) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995=\r\n/?pg=3Dmay-jun\nb) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n=\r\nc) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd292127bbb65047d95397a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIn 1931, after reading about Sri Aurobindo, and also hearing abo=\r\nut him from others, I made my way to his ashrama in Pondicherry.

Bhag=\r\navan made no comment.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The next day, as soon as I walked into the ha=\r\nll and sat down, Bhagavan looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakon=\r\nam there was one yogi, C. V. V. Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctri=\r\nne of the immortality of the body. He was even so bold as to declare that D=\r\nr. Annie Besant (a distinguished public and spiritual personality in India)=\r\n would have to come to him to learn how to make her body immortal. But, bef=\r\nore he had a chance to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief sto=\r\nry clearly illustrated his point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style=\r\n:italic&quot;&gt;On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ramanasramam,=\r\n I approached Bhagavan when no one was in the hall and showed him that last=\r\n letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to give it to him =\r\nto read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwrit=\r\ning, as it was very illegible and only those who have studied it for someti=\r\nme could read it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nAfter looking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he =\r\nreturned it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came=\r\n to the sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which =\r\nyou can achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me a=\r\nnd said, &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization=\r\n, and if it is realization, it is not partial.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This was the =\r\nfinal blow that silenced all my doubts.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0I then destroyed this l=\r\netter, like all the rest. And because of all the discussions I had had with=\r\n Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, having a clea=\r\nr understanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path d=\r\niverged and went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts and distract=\r\nions dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then knew that I understoo=\r\nd and the foundation work had been done. The purpose of all our discussions=\r\n were served and so they stopped automatically.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan was the=\r\n power of his presence.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Much of what he taught had already been=\r\n transmitted to the masses down through the ages. In Bhagavan we found a be=\r\ning that was surcharged with the Reality to such an extent that coming into=\r\n his presence would effect a dramatic change in us.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/span&gt;:=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmay-jun&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmay-jun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmar-apr&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nc) &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug&quot; target=3D&quot;_bl=\r\nank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-=\r\nleft:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 5=\r\n1);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margi=\r\nn-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =\r\n=C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd292127bbb65047d95397a--\r\n\n"}}
