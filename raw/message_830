Please\n&gt; elaborate. Your expalinat=\r\nions are very convincing.\n \nTo me, the ideal pooja room is a clean and pure=\r\n heart. Ideal pooja room is a heart that has no malice for anyone and no eg=\r\no/pride. Ideal pooja room is a heart that does not feel proud when others p=\r\nraise one and does not feel bad when others abuse one. Ideal pooja room is =\r\na heart in which one&#39;s favorite deity is established firmly. Ideal pooja ro=\r\nom is a heart that is peaceful and views everything and everyone with an eq=\r\nual vision, as a manifestation of one&#39;s favorite deity. Ideal pooja pooja r=\r\noom is a heart that does not feel great attraction or great aversion toward=\r\ns anything or anyone. Ideal pooja room is a heart that can engage in variou=\r\ns kinds of actions without emotions normally associated those actions linge=\r\nring in it.\n \nThe purpose of a physical pooja room is to create an ideal po=\r\noja room as described above in one&#39;s heart. Exactly which articles and prac=\r\ntices in the physical pooja room mould one&#39;s thinking to create the ideal p=\r\nooja room described above in one&#39;s heart depends on who one is, what one&#39;s =\r\nkarmas and rinas are and how one&#39;s mind is conditioned currently. A particu=\r\nlar photo of a deity and meditation in front of it may cultivate that spiri=\r\nt in one person after enough time. A particular idol of a deity and bathing=\r\n of it everyday may cultivate that spirit in one person after enough time. =\r\nOne should use the articles and practices that appeal to one and that are s=\r\nuggested by one&#39;s gurus and elders. But the bottomline is that the ideal po=\r\noja room exists only in one&#39;s heart and one should never forget it. Choices=\r\nt photos, idols, pooja articles and rituals in the physical pooja room are =\r\nuseless when one&#39;s heart is impure. Use a physical pooja room to create the=\r\n ideal pooja room in your heart.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI would like to qu=\r\note some portions from the book &quot;Vasishtha&#39;s Yoga&quot; by Swami Venkatesananda.=\r\n This is a translation of &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. Here Lord Siva teaches Mahars=\r\nhi Vasishtha how to worship the supreme lord of the universe.\n \n&quot;It is he i=\r\nndeed who is worshipped by wise men in various ways and in various forms su=\r\nch as Siva, Vishnu, etc. Now listen to the ways in which he is to be worshi=\r\npped.\n \n&quot;First of all, one should abandon the body-idea (the notion that &#39;I=\r\n am this body&#39;). Meditation alone is true worship. Hence one should constan=\r\ntly worship the Lord of the three worlds by means of meditation. How should=\r\n one contemplate him? He is pure intelligence, he is as radiant as a thousa=\r\nnd suns risen together, he is the light that illumines all lights, he is th=\r\ne inner light, the limitless space is his throat, the firmament is his feet=\r\n, the directions are his arms, the worlds are the weapons he bears in his h=\r\nands, the entire universe is hidden in his heart, the gods are hairs on his=\r\n body, the cosmic potencies are energies in his body, time is his gate-keep=\r\ner and he has thousands of heads, eyes, ears and arms. He touches all, tast=\r\nes all, he hears all, he thinks through all though he is beyond thiniking. =\r\nHe does everything at all times, he bestows whatever one thinks of or desir=\r\nes, he dwells in all, he is the all, he alone is to be sought by all. Thus =\r\nshould one contemplate him.\n \n&quot;The Lord is not to be worshipped by material=\r\n substances but by one&#39;s own consciousness. Not be waving of lamps nor ligh=\r\nting incense, nor by offering flowers nor even by offering food or sandalpa=\r\nste. He is worshipped by self-realisation alone. This is the supreme medita=\r\ntion, this is the supreme worship: the continuous and unbroken awareness of=\r\n the indwelling presence, inner light or consciousness. While doing whateve=\r\nr one is doing - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleep=\r\ning, breathing or talking - one should realize one&#39;s essential nature as pu=\r\nre consciousness.\n \n&quot;One should contemplate that the Lord is the intelligen=\r\nce in the body. The various functions and faculties in the body serve that =\r\nintelligence as consorts serve their lord. The mind is the messenger who br=\r\nings and presents to the Lord the knowledge of the three worlds. The two fu=\r\nndamental energies, viz., the energy of wisdom (jnaana sakti) and the energ=\r\ny of action (kriyaa sakti), are the consorts of the Lord. Diverse aspects o=\r\nf knowledge are his ornaments.  The organs of action are the gates through =\r\nwhich the Lord enters the outside world.\n \n&quot;He who contemplates in this man=\r\nner is equanimity itself, his behavior is equanimous, guided by equal visio=\r\nn. He has reached the state of natural goodness and inner purity and he is =\r\nbeautiful in every aspect of his being. He worships the Lord who is the int=\r\nelligence that pervades his entire body.\n \n&quot; The worship is performed day a=\r\nnd night perpetually, with the objects that are effortlessly obtained, and =\r\nare offered to the Lord with a mind firmless established in equanimity and =\r\nin the right spirit. The Lord should be worshipped with everything that is =\r\nobtained without effort. One should never make the least effort to obtain t=\r\nhat which one does not possess. The Lord should be worshipped by means of a=\r\nll the enjoyments that the body enjoys, through eating, drinking, being wit=\r\nh one&#39;s consort and such other pleasures. The Lord should be worshipped wit=\r\nh the illnesses one experiences and with every sort of unhappiness or suffe=\r\nring one experiences. The Lord should be worshipped with all of one&#39;s activ=\r\nities, including life and death and all of one&#39;s dreams. The Lord should be=\r\n worshipped with one&#39;s poverty and prosperity. The Lord should be worshippe=\r\nd even with fights and quarrels as well as woth sports and other passtimes,=\r\n and with manifestation of emotions of attraction and aversion. The Lord sh=\r\nould be adored with the noble qualities of a pious heart - friendship, comp=\r\nassion, joy and indifference.\n \n&quot;The Lord should be worshipped with all kin=\r\nds of pleasures that are granted to one unsought, whether those pleasures a=\r\nre sanctioned by the scriptures, etc., or forbidden by them. The Lord shoul=\r\nd be worshipped with those which are regarded as desirable and others which=\r\n are regarded as undesirable, with those that are considered appropriate an=\r\nd others that are considered inappropriate. For this worship, one should ab=\r\nandon what is lost and one should accept and receive what has been obtained=\r\n without effort.&quot;\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe above is the ideal pooja reco=\r\nmmended by Lord Siva to Maharshi Vasishtha. To reach the mental state requi=\r\nred for this pooja, one may have to perform other poojas and rituals that r=\r\nequire conscious effort to do some things and avoid some other things. But =\r\nthe end goal is the reach the state of equanimity described above by Lord S=\r\niva.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarp=\r\nana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------ \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n        Adarniya Naras=\r\nimha Guruji Namaste,\n\n        I kindly request you to please spare your pre=\r\ncious time to let me/us know what should a pooja room contain & what should=\r\n be done every day during pooja i.e., bathing of idols every day required. =\r\nPhoto & idol of same diety to be kept or not etc.,.
