Thanks a lot.\n\n=\r\nWarm Regards,\nShashi\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Shashi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. For most mantras, there is =\r\nno such requirement. You can make your offering anywhere in the homa kundam=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. It is a good idea to do so. Even if you keep the same water for =\r\na few days, it can become impure by coming in contact with various energies=\r\n present in the air around us.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, realize that the kalasha is a sy=\r\nmbol of one&#39;s physical body, which is mostly made of water! When you purify=\r\n the external kalasha, imagine your body as a kalasha and imagine the conte=\r\nnt of your body being purified.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, a separate kalasha with water an=\r\nd powder of auspicious materials (e.g. cardamom, cloves, saffron, sandalwoo=\r\nd, jaapatri/javentry etc) covered by a coconut can be used for invoking the=\r\n deity, in addition to fire and an idol. That is perfectly fine. In the sho=\r\nrt procedure, we have removed it. If you ask me, fire alone is sufficient a=\r\nnd even an idol is not really needed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Typically, people perform a hom=\r\nam once every 6 months or every year. So one makes sure to install a kalash=\r\na, do homam and then use the sanctified water in the kalasha to do abhishek=\r\nam (bathing) to idols at house or to oneself. The water in the kalasha in w=\r\nhich the deity was invoked in addition to fire becomes sanctified to some e=\r\nxtent and one intends to transfer the little shakti captured by the water t=\r\no an idol or to oneself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One can also keep a kalasha with water and s=\r\nugandha dravyas and change water once every week or two and use the water t=\r\no do abhishekam to idols at house or to oneself. That is what I do with my =\r\ndaily Chandi homam.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, if one does a homam regularly, the kalas=\r\nha that the body is becomes pure enough and slowly becomes sanctified. The =\r\nsymbol of having an exteral kalasha loses its significance gradually. Basic=\r\nally, when your body sits next to fire and performs homam regularly, that i=\r\ns sufficient and the additional benefit of physical contact with a water po=\r\nt in which you visualized god is smaller.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one wants to maintain an=\r\n idol with some shakti concentration, then it is a good idea to also keep a=\r\n kalasha with homam and use the water to bathe the idol now and then.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n 3. Right.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. When there is a death in immediate family, traditionall=\r\ny people do not do homam. When related people who you do not know well pass=\r\n away, it has no effect really. On the other hand, there CAN be a strong ef=\r\nfect on your subtle body when an unrelated person who is close to you passe=\r\ns away! Though shastras give guidelines on how many days apply to each rela=\r\ntion, it is based on a model of how close you are to each relation. Such th=\r\nings change based on desa-kaala-paatra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Basically, when some people p=\r\nass away, their mind is confused and distressed and it has a subtle effect =\r\non your subtle body. So you will be unable to concentrate and focus your mi=\r\nnd well.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you are upset about something, it is a bad idea to go to =\r\nthe king to talk some business and ask him for something. But it is fine to=\r\n go to your mother or father and talk to them. Similarly, homam performed t=\r\no ensure certain material results should be avoided when one&#39;s mind is not =\r\nin a perfect state. But a homam performed with surrender, for spiritual pro=\r\ngress, can be performed in my humble opinion always, irrespective of the st=\r\nate of mind. Regarding the former, please note that minds of most people ar=\r\ne not in a &quot;perfect state&quot; these days, even when there was no death in fami=\r\nly. Thus, people are better off not trying rituals aimed to bring specific =\r\nresults.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- shashi_nambisan &lt;s=\r\nhashin@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     First of all many thanks to N=\r\narasimha & Manish for the detailed Homam manuals .\n&gt; &gt;      These are some =\r\nbasic questions, I have been having.\n&gt; &gt;       1. In the Initial part of Ga=\r\nnapathy Homam Manuals, The direction of movement of ladle with ghee while p=\r\nouring & saying &#39;Swaha&#39; is mentioned, but rest of the places there is no di=\r\nrection mentioned.\n&gt; &gt;      Is there any generic rule when there is no dire=\r\nctions mentioned?\n&gt; &gt;    2. On the &#39;Kalash Suddhi&#39; when you keep in for a w=\r\neek, before changing the water, do we need to do the &#39;Kalash Suddhi&#39; proced=\r\nure everytime to the same water?\n&gt; &gt;      Also in some other homams i had h=\r\nappen to see there is a kalash with saffron,clove etc installed and a cocon=\r\nut kept above the same. But the water is never taken in this case!!\n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n Any idea on the difference?\n&gt; &gt;    3. In the &#39;pranayamam&#39; towards the end,=\r\n I am assuming that there is no need to keep\n&gt; &gt;       &#39;akshata&#39; in the lef=\r\nt hand as in the first time. Is this right? \n&gt; &gt;    4. Are there any days d=\r\nuring which you should not do Homam? eg  Passing away of  relations etc, es=\r\npecially when you only have heard of them and not known them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Than=\r\nks & Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Shashi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
