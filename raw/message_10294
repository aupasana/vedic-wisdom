Sending mail to this group as I think many members are com=\r\nmon\nTo Kannan ji who took offense at marking to personal id. Try to see car=\r\nefully, mail was sent to jyotishgroup and not delivered, hence i forwarded =\r\nto all members who were in discussion on this topic. You were not exclusive=\r\nly marked. Next time free to rant but with facts.\nRegards\nPuneet\nNamaste to=\r\n all,\n=C2=A0\nNow that result is clear, it is time to make a judgement on pr=\r\nedictions and later few words on Ranter &#39;Kannan Iyenger&#39;=C2=A0below.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\n1. I tracked most of the astrologers. Almost all were wrong. Many said the=\r\nre is absolutely no chance. And among other&#39;s who gave him a chance, they w=\r\nere also sceptical. Bejan Daruwalla had said there is 54% chance of Modi as=\r\n PM. Narasimha ji said 60%. These predictions were wrong as 50% chance is f=\r\nor even Mulayam, Mayawati or for that matter anyone contesting. Anyone sayi=\r\nng above 90-95% may be called correct though with the extent of final victo=\r\nry, those who said 100% should be considered correct.\n=C2=A0\n2. I will look=\r\n for Narasimha Ji&#39;s other prediction of political instability over next 2 y=\r\nears. It does not look true looking at present victory status of BJP/NDA. H=\r\nis statement on AAP&#39;s performance in my view is incorrect. Punjab&#39;s success=\r\n (though unexpected a month back)=C2=A0is limited and them losing Delhi mea=\r\nns spectacular failure. Kejriwal is silent on twitter for last 2 days and t=\r\no me it shows he is unhappy with performance.\n=C2=A0\n3. Somebody had commen=\r\nted on Exit polls being wrong. On the contrary, most were right. Todays Cha=\r\nnakya was right to last digit (291 =C2=B1 14 #Cong 57 =C2=B1 9 #NDA 340 =C2=\r\n=B114 #UPA 70 =C2=B19 Others 133 =C2=B111 Seats). CVoter got vote percentag=\r\ne right (Just 1% variation), not the seat conversion. Even www.5forty3.com =\r\nhad predicted 320 seats for NDA and absolute majority for BJP. The only rea=\r\nson other polls were not right to last digit (Even though they got overall =\r\ntrend) is because in a &#39;wave election&#39; it is difficult to get seat conversi=\r\non right. How will anyone predict 72 seats in UP (Chanakya predicted 70 and=\r\n had got lot of flak). Overall, exit polls were far more satisfying than mo=\r\nst astrologers\n=C2=A0\n4. I have a quotation of Swami Vivekananda gifted to =\r\nme by someone &quot;You are the creator of your own destiny&quot;. While I do not hav=\r\ne the context of this, Modi has proved this to be true. If he had believed =\r\nin astrologers, he would not have gone on 24th April to file nominations as=\r\n that was considered a non-auspicious day. But my understanding is that he =\r\nwanted limelight for elections being held on that day and went with that in=\r\nstinct. He got what he wanted and astrologers were proved wrong. Also, when=\r\n he had setup mission 272, it seemed impossible target (No astrologer backi=\r\nng too), again he went &#39;single minded devotion and passion&#39; to=C2=A0what he=\r\n wanted. Created his own destiny.\n=C2=A0\n5. Now, on the rants of gentleman =\r\nbelow. Let me state it with conviction that he seems to be a follower of AA=\r\nP philosophy. No astrological reason but because his followers are perennia=\r\nlly angry, totally selfish and will make big statements without backing tha=\r\nt with action. Following are the issues raised by Kannan in his rants\n=C2=\r\n=A0\na) 2002 &#39;Genocide&#39;\n=C2=A0\nGenocide is a term used for near or total ann=\r\nihilation of a religious group. Stupid ranters use such strong words when 2=\r\n5% of people who dies in Gujarat riots were &#39;Hindus&#39;. That when they are 90=\r\n% of population in Gujarat. Many other (Mainly Hindus) have perished in bom=\r\nb attacks & Jehadi actions like Mumbai attacks. A factual description is av=\r\nailable here http://kiranasis.blogspot.in/2011/09/godhra-train-burning-yet-=\r\nanother-rewind.html=C2=A0. However, there will never be end to questions if=\r\n Modi did enough or not . Kannan ji is free to live in his angry delusions =\r\nforever.\n=C2=A0\nb) PR machinery like APCO\n=C2=A0\nFact 1: Heard Dentsu? It i=\r\ns a PR machinery from Japan who were given 500 cr contract for Rahul&#39;s imag=\r\ne. \nFact 2: Congress spent more money in TV advertising than BJP. \nFact 3: =\r\nCongress also used Govt money to advertise about schemes and started TV adv=\r\nertisement months before BJP\n=C2=A0\nWhy did Congress&#39;s fail so badly while =\r\nBJP&#39;s PR spectacular success? Being from marketing background, I can go in =\r\ndeep detail and give you terminologies but I will leave you with the words =\r\nof a man of wisdom which you will need to read many times to understand. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\n&quot;First become &#39;that&#39; & projection happens automatically&quot;\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nc) MNC backing & no development\n=C2=A0\nCorporate backing is clear. No d=\r\nevelopment is a failed argument and I need not give links to prove it. All =\r\nelection season we have heard and annihilated all arguments and counter-arg=\r\numents. I am sure you know those but ranted nevertheless\n=C2=A0\nEven the ha=\r\nrshest of Modi&#39;s critics agree that this man has boundless energy and works=\r\n very hard. He is techno savvy and visionary. Those who listened to his spe=\r\nech in Varanasi yesterday would know that he gave the city and country a cl=\r\neanliness mission for 2019 and tied it to Gandhi&#39;s 150th anniversary. That&#39;=\r\ns vision and a way to motivate. \n=C2=A0\nd) Hindus sitting outside should no=\r\nt comment\n=C2=A0\nOn the contrary, Hindus when they go outside India redisco=\r\nver their roots. They also compare with Western progress and want that for =\r\nIndia. India is a sacred land for all Hindus wherever they may be in world.=\r\n They have all rights to worry about it as anyone living in India has. Chan=\r\nakya had said the following wise statement thousand of years back and Mr. I=\r\nyenger should read it many times\n=C2=A0\n&quot;No country is foreign to a man of =\r\nknowledge&quot;\n=C2=A0\ne) America is devil\n=C2=A0\nThen stop your usage of Americ=\r\nan inventions. Don&#39;t use electricity, Internet, TV, AC etc. Start living in=\r\n a hut and then preach. It is same kind of rants which Islamists use. They =\r\nwant all inventions, all dollars from America but will want it&#39;s death.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIn reality,=C2=A0it is great that people who understand Dharma are in A=\r\nmerica and working to change it from inside. Someday one of them may become=\r\n it&#39;s leader and will change the fate of entire earth. Hindus before 10th C=\r\nentury AD were very enterprising and visited entire globe. Something happen=\r\ned afterwards and they developed these stupid theories.\n=C2=A0\nf)=C2=A0 My =\r\nbharat mata needs no one&#39;s luck. Sanatan Dharma will protect itself.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nYour Bharat Mata has been reduced to 10% of it&#39;s influence which once spre=\r\nad from Afghanistan to Indonesia & even exported to China. 30% area has bee=\r\nn cut in last century itself. Hindus & other minorities have been brutally =\r\nannihilated in Pakistan and in Bangladesh. Dharma is in danger inside what =\r\nis remaining. What did your Bharat Mata did?\n=C2=A0\nInstead of pulling back=\r\n the one who talks of unity and regaining strength, look at history and lea=\r\nrn. As Narasimha ji once very eloquently said &quot;Even God functions through h=\r\numans&quot;\n=C2=A0\nI have met countless Iyers and Iyengers in my life and as a c=\r\nohesive group, they are among the most intelligent humans on earth. Perhaps=\r\n generations of devotion to knowledge had an impact at DNA level.

I tracked most of the astrologers. Almost all were wrong. M=\r\nany said there is absolutely no chance. And among other&#39;s who gave him a ch=\r\nance, they were also sceptical. Bejan Daruwalla had said there is 54% chanc=\r\ne of Modi as PM. Narasimha ji said 60%. These predictions were wrong as 50%=\r\n chance is for even Mulayam, Mayawati or for that matter anyone contesting.=\r\n Anyone saying above 90-95% may be called correct though with the extent of=\r\n final victory, those who said 100% should be considered correct.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;2. I will look for Narasimha Ji&#39;s other prediction of=\r\n political instability over next 2 years. It does not look true looking at =\r\npresent victory status of BJP/NDA. His statement on AAP&#39;s performance in my=\r\n view is incorrect. Punjab&#39;s success (though unexpected a month back)&nbsp;=\r\nis limited and them losing Delhi means spectacular failure. Kejriwal is sil=\r\nent on twitter for last 2 days and to me it shows he is unhappy with perfor=\r\nmance.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;3. Somebody had commented on Exit pol=\r\nls being wrong. On the contrary, most were right. Todays Chanakya was right=\r\n to last digit (291 =C2=B1 14 &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; dir=3D&quot;ltr=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23Cong&amp;src=\r\n=3Dhash&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#66c1e0&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0099cc&quot;&gt;=\r\nCong&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 57 =C2=B1 9 &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; dir=3D&quot;l=\r\ntr&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23NDA&amp;src=\r\n=3Dhash&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#66c1e0&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0099cc&quot;&gt;=\r\nNDA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 340 =C2=B114 &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; dir=3D&quot;l=\r\ntr&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23UPA&amp;src=\r\n=3Dhash&quot;&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#66c1e0&quot;&gt;#&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0099cc&quot;&gt;=\r\nUPA&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 70 =C2=B19 Others 133 =C2=B111 Seats). CVoter got vote p=\r\nercentage right (Just 1% variation), not the seat conversion. Even &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.5forty3.c=\r\nom/&quot;&gt;www.5forty3.com&lt;/a&gt; had\n predicted 320 seats for NDA and absolute majo=\r\nrity for BJP. The only reason other polls were not right to last digit (Eve=\r\nn though they got overall trend) is because in a &#39;wave election&#39; it is diff=\r\nicult to get seat conversion right. How will anyone predict 72 seats in UP =\r\n(Chanakya predicted 70 and had got lot of flak). Overall, exit polls were f=\r\nar more satisfying than most astrologers&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;4. =\r\nI have a quotation of Swami Vivekananda gifted to me by someone &quot;You are th=\r\ne creator of your own destiny&quot;. While I do not have the context of this, Mo=\r\ndi has proved this to be true. If he had believed in astrologers, he would =\r\nnot have gone on 24th April to file nominations as that was considered a no=\r\nn-auspicious day. But my understanding is that he wanted limelight for elec=\r\ntions being held on that day and went with that instinct. He got what he wa=\r\nnted and astrologers were proved wrong. Also, when he had setup mission 272=\r\n, it seemed impossible target (No astrologer backing too), again he went &#39;s=\r\ningle minded devotion and passion&#39; to&nbsp;what he wanted. Created his own =\r\ndestiny.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;5. Now, on the rants of gentleman b=\r\nelow. Let me state it with conviction that he seems to be a follower of AAP=\r\n philosophy. No astrological reason but because his followers are perennial=\r\nly angry, totally selfish and will make big statements without backing that=\r\n with action. Following are the issues raised by Kannan in his rants&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;a) 2002 &#39;Genocide&#39;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;Genocide is a term used for near or total anni=\r\nhilation of a religious group. Stupid ranters use such strong words when 25=\r\n% of people who dies in Gujarat riots were &#39;Hindus&#39;. That when they are 90%=\r\n of population in Gujarat. Many other (Mainly Hindus) have perished in bomb=\r\n attacks &amp; Jehadi actions like Mumbai attacks.
