Instead of being\n&gt; an older child who knows a lot of things and has t=\r\no fend for himself, be a\n&gt; small child who does not know much and who depen=\r\nds on parents.\n&gt;\n&gt; This simple approach will optimize the results you get f=\r\nrom your sadhana.\n&gt; Sometimes (many times) what you want may not be the rig=\r\nht thing for you. God\n&gt; is the Director with the full script of the movie i=\r\nn hand, while we are two\n&gt; cent actors who act in one or two scenes and kno=\r\nw nothing about the rest of\n&gt; the movie. Why not leave it to the Director, =\r\ninstead of taking charge and\n&gt; trying to dictate how a particular scene sho=\r\nuld be handled, when we know\n&gt; nothing about the whole movie and how our ch=\r\naracter fits in the whole\n&gt; script?\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) Shastras do prescribe specific =\r\nmaterials for specific results. However,\n&gt; I suggest that it is not so simp=\r\nle as offering a specific material. Offering\n&gt; a specific material is only =\r\none aspect in getting a result.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just for reference, I will mention a fe=\r\nw things given in shastras.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; For getting money, use the leaves=\r\n of bilva (bel) tree. To extend longevity,\n&gt; use darbhas (sacred grass). Fo=\r\nr getting physical strength, use the canes of\n&gt; vetas (rattan palm or Calam=\r\nus rotang) tree. For getting married and marital\n&gt; bliss, use parched rice.=\r\n For getting a child, use the seeds of shaali tree\n&gt; (also known as kaalonj=\r\ni or krishna jeera or black cumene seeds). For cattle\n&gt; and well-being, use=\r\n ghee. For knowledge, use the wood of Palaasha tree\n&gt; (palash/modugu/Butea =\r\nmonosperma). For success in agriculture, use barley\n&gt; grains. For overcomin=\r\ng enemies, use guggul (a resin with anti-cholesterol\n&gt; properties in ayurve=\r\nda). For good health, use sesame seeds - white for\n&gt; mental (and spiritual)=\r\n health and black for physical. For general happiness\n&gt; and prosperity, use=\r\n various grains such as rice, juwar dhani etc. For good\n&gt; relations and att=\r\nracting others, use the flowers or seeds of daadimi\n&gt; (anaar/daanimma/pomeg=\r\nranate).\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, Shiva taught Parvati specific materials for the six=\r\n activities:\n&gt; shaanti (peace-making), stambhana (paralyzing), maarana (kil=\r\nling),\n&gt; uchchaatana (explusion), vashikarana (creating attraction between =\r\npeople)\n&gt; and vidveshana (creating hatred between people). For example, one=\r\n can use\n&gt; darbha (sacred grass) dipped in ghee made with cow&#39;s milk for sh=\r\nanti\n&gt; (peace-making). These activities (other than peace-making) entail ba=\r\nd karma\n&gt; and not for normal sadhakas. These activities are justified only =\r\nwhen a\n&gt; highly elevated sadhaka performs them for the greater good of the =\r\nworld. So\n&gt; I will not even mention those specific materials.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n The art of getting specific results through rituals has almost disappeared=\r\n\n&gt; and will become more extinct as time passes. Within Kali yuga, we are\n&gt; =\r\nentering a renewal/redefinition phase where knowledge will be re-establishe=\r\nd\n&gt; for the upcoming phase of further decay of dharma. There will be\n&gt; re-e=\r\nstablishment of dharma in the next 200-400 years, but with focus on\n&gt; setti=\r\nng rules and procedures that will be the guiding light for the next 1-2\n&gt; t=\r\nhousand years when dharma will decay more.
