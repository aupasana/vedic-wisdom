When Saturn passes through Janma Rasi of Kanya, those bor=\r\nn in stars of Uttara-Phalguni =E2=80=93 Hastham =E2=80=93 Chittirai may liv=\r\ne frequently separated from family. They could wonder in foreign lands. The=\r\ny could feel lonely. They could feel undecided in plans in domestic front. =\r\n They may pick up quarrels in least provocation. Some could suffer with phy=\r\nsical troubles, or ailments. Some could run pillar to post without any aim.=\r\n Some could be troubled by unwanted problems =E2=80=93 being (second) move =\r\nof two and half years in =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 in the house=\r\n where the Moon is deposited in the Natal =E2=80=99s Birth Chart. Transit i=\r\nn this house is the secvond part of three parts of Sade Sati. \n\t2. For many=\r\n it will be bereft of good appearance, happiness, pride and short of adequa=\r\nte earning to meet basic demands in life, when Saturn passes through 2nd  H=\r\nouse  from Simha =E2=80=93  in Stars Makam, Poorvapalguni, Uttara Phalguni =\r\nthe last part in three  parts of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=80=99. Some has to m=\r\neet excess expenditure, and could easily become tired in work place. For on=\r\ne cause to another, some could be persistently in grief, and have commercia=\r\nl losses. One should avoid in total, gambling any form, share market stakes=\r\n, to avoid financial loss as well as avoidable humiliation. Certainly they =\r\nshould avoid bad company, association, illegal connections with opposite se=\r\nx, some could harm educational progress, realize virility falling down, get=\r\n across to avoid the temptation of earning through illegal means. Many will=\r\n be forced borrow amounts beyond means to repay them, due to domestic unexp=\r\nected needs. \n\t3. Those born with Moon in Cancer =E2=80=93 Kataka =E2=80=93=\r\n Rasi - in Stars Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha will have the most profitable,=\r\n progressive, and satisfactory period of next Two and half years, with plen=\r\nty and prosperity.  They will be free from any type of ailments. They will =\r\nsucceed in heroic efforts.  Fortunes shines on this native, They will have =\r\nmany travel to gain. Their spouse will be happy in all expectations from th=\r\ne partner through this period of next two and half years. This period will =\r\nshine to bring prosperity and popularity to all politicians in public life =\r\nwith birth Stars of Pumarpoosam, Pusam and Ayilyam. The bed time desires wi=\r\nll be fully satisfactory. Auspicious events, hither to delayed, will culmin=\r\nate to the satisfaction of all. Friends will help the native and siblings w=\r\nill progress. \n\t4. The mood and act of native having Moon in Gemini =E2=80=\r\n=93 Mithuna =E2=80=93 in Janma Kundali, in Stars Mrigasheera, Arudhra, and =\r\nPunarvasu will be far from social norms, and he becomes vindictive in react=\r\nions, when Saturn transits in 4th house.  That person will be separated fro=\r\nm friends.  Some may lose properties and quarrel with spouse leading to irr=\r\neparable results.  One could lose a dear and near relative. Body ailments b=\r\nased on colic with flatulence, along with mental distress and fear could tr=\r\nouble many. (This is called Ardhashtama Sani or Kantaka Sani)  For some, in=\r\n their Birth Chart findings, if life span is near its end, this period coul=\r\nd cause extreme anxiety resulting in death of that person. A few, may not f=\r\nind a comfortable shelter.  Some could develop fear that about something or=\r\n other. \n\t5. Those born with Moon in Taurus =E2=80=93 in Stars Karthika, Ro=\r\nhini, and Mirgasheera, Saturn, during this period, will be moving in 5th ho=\r\nuse from the position of Moon in the Birth Chart. One should be careful to =\r\navoid any confrontation with his children.  Expenses on them will increase,=\r\n more than normal. Problems due to their wrong involvements could cause anx=\r\niety, waste of money, and related confrontations. Some could fail in their =\r\nundertakings, and incur money loss. One could invite troubles due to union =\r\nwith mean partner in sex. One could be forced to move away from family with=\r\nout repute. Accumulated assets may dwindle during this period, in undesired=\r\n involvement. \n\t6. Moon should be in Aeries =E2=80=93 Mesha =E2=80=93 in hi=\r\ns birth Stars Aswani, Bharani and Karthikai ,to know that in this period Sa=\r\nturn is moving in 6th house to the place of Moon in birth chart.  One will =\r\novercome suddenly all his enemies =E2=80=93 a last ball =E2=80=98sixer=E2=\r\n=80=99 to win a cricket match! The spouse, must be floating in joy and comf=\r\nort and be proud of the partner. Lady can get a long waited pregnancy and b=\r\necome proud of her child. Financial status increase unexpectedly. The perso=\r\nn will find that appreciation never could ever come from a known person, wi=\r\nll pour in abundance from that person to create a flood of growth in popula=\r\nrity. All sickness will disappear and health will be blooming. All desired =\r\nluxuries and comforts will be there for asking! \n\t7. Saturn, going into the=\r\n 7th house for next two and half years, to the position of Moon, - Pieces =\r\n=E2=80=93 Meena - for those born in Stars Poorvapathrapada (poorattathi) , =\r\nUtharapathrapada (Uttirattathi) , Revathi in the birth chart will cause hea=\r\nlthy separation from family frequently, while putting all efforts and hard =\r\nwork with dedication in work to invite appreciation and reward from all. So=\r\nme could have minor ailments during this period. However, one has to be car=\r\neful in expenses. Those traveling in speedy vehicles could either commit an=\r\n accident or involve themselves to put them away on bed for some time. Abso=\r\nlute careful driving is recommended. One should not invite perennial proble=\r\nms due to illicit relations with opposite sex, which could damage the reput=\r\nation of the person. Here Saturn could give malefic effects more that what =\r\nis detailed above when he passed through the fourth house to the position o=\r\nf Moon in the birth chart. \n\t8. One would be dragged to extreme and damagin=\r\ng temptations during this period for those having Moon in Aquarius =E2=80=\r\n=93 Kumbha =E2=80=93 Born in the stars of Dhanishta (Avittam), Sathabhisha =\r\n(Sathayam),Poorvabh adrapada (Poorattathi) , he will be away from family of=\r\nten.  (This position  of transit is termed as =E2=80=98Ashtama Sani=E2=80=\r\n=99).   One has to be careful with the company in which he associates to av=\r\noid bad repercussions and heavy loss of earnings. Consequently, the good fr=\r\niends and relatives will be put to trouble.  Decrease in wealth, troubles d=\r\nue to ill health, obstacles to various undertakings could cause mental depr=\r\nession during this period. There could be eye trouble.  Acute shortage of m=\r\noney would be felt by many. Some sort of mental agony will always persist. =\r\n Certainly please avoid any bad physical relationship during this period in=\r\n emotional involvement with one, which could bring in perennial problem all=\r\n life. \n\t9. Having transit of Saturn in the 9th house from the position of =\r\nMoon in Capricorn =E2=80=93 Makara =E2=80=93  born in Starsof Utthirashada =\r\n(Uthiradam), Sravana (Thiruvonam), Dhanishta (Avittam) in the birth chart, =\r\none has to watch out for enemies to harm him in least excuse. One has to wo=\r\nrk very hard which normally he could finish it easily and early. Lose of fi=\r\nnance is imminent, unless this condition is offset by other Planets, positi=\r\noned or in transit, in birth chart, which are in favor.  Distress concernin=\r\ng spouse and progeny will also exist. Money will be spent in unwanted and u=\r\nseless purposes. Keep away from any unknown opposite sex.  If the judged li=\r\nfe span coincides with Maraka Desa, at this time, many related disappointme=\r\nnts could become confronted by the Jathaka.  The sources of income will be =\r\nobstructed. Saturn transiting in 9th house is generally not safe and satisf=\r\nactory a period. \n\t10. When Moon is positioned in Sagittarius =E2=80=93 Dha=\r\nnush =E2=80=93 Moolam, Poorvashada (Puradam), Uthrashada, (Uttirsadfum) and=\r\n Saturn is transiting in the 10th house (Kanya), it could bring in sudden e=\r\nxpenses and fall in reputation.  One could cause distress, loss of work, me=\r\net obstructions and objections to decisions, to cause bewilderment.  Many c=\r\nould not satisfactorily complete the education.  One could have meager inco=\r\nme for hard work.  Avoid agitations, violent involvement for public cause a=\r\nnd enter to peace with fighting groups, which could result in never ending =\r\nlitigations and sufferings. One could lose respect and gain humiliation. It=\r\n is firmly said that the native will undergo ordeals when Saturn is in 10th=\r\n from Janma Rasi. \n\t11. The Moon in Scorpio =3D Vruchika =E2=80=93 Rasi in =\r\nthe stars of Visakam, Anuradha (Anusham), Jyesta (Kettai), Saturn is in the=\r\n 11th house to the position of Moon in Birth chart. One gets pleasure, mone=\r\ny, and comfort from spouse. One will find success in all endeavors in which=\r\n involved. The person will get elevated status and gain appreciation.  Exce=\r\nllent health, many financial gains, increase in happiness related to spouse=\r\n and children and have people with pure heart and deed around the person al=\r\nl time. If wife is pregnant during this period a female child will be born =\r\nto him (subject to, of course, result of many other factors in the birth ch=\r\nart to be considered, in both partners=E2=80=99 chart, before such a pronou=\r\nncement is made!). One could get extra-ordinary elevations in his place of =\r\nwork.  Some could get money belonging to others! These two and half years w=\r\nill be very good. \n\t12. When Saturn is positioned in the 12th house from Mo=\r\non, in Stars of Chittirai (Chitta), Swathi, Visakam, it is easily said that=\r\n just the opposite will result to all that is said, under item 11 above. Do=\r\n not possess or hold any money belonging to others! One will be plunged in =\r\nseries of miseries, as that will be the first leg of =E2=80=98Sade Sati=E2=\r\n=80=99, - Chittirai, Swati, Visakam Stars.  All endeavors fail. Intelligenc=\r\ne and skill get diminished.  His reputation is affected. The person=E2=80=\r\n=99s life span judged in the birth chart to the Desha period in effect duri=\r\nng this period, could cause health hazards and death, if it is Maraka Lord =\r\nDesha period.  Intensified malefic period will be in exercise during this p=\r\neriod of two and half years.\n \n \nPlease Note:  The details given above are =\r\ngeneral and millions would have born in each category.  Therefore, a comple=\r\nte study of individual charts is absolutely necessary before these comments=\r\n are taken as effective.  Many changes due to relations of Other Planets, b=\r\ny its position, occupation and qualities with the movement of Saturn and it=\r\ns position has to be studied in depth before individual results are set to =\r\nbe pronounced.\n \nPathi.\nA.V.Pathi,  \nAstrologer, &#39;Oxton House&#39;, 6, Hawthorn=\r\n Road,Cherry Willingham,\nLincoln LN3 4JT, United Kingdom .   \nstart: 0000-0=\r\n0-00\nend: 0000-00-00 \n   \n\n\n      \r\n--0-589496890-1251770252=:4022\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14p=\r\nt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; =\r\npadding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-=\r\nsize: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;Dear all,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;I write this i=\r\nn continuation of my mail to Shri Venkatachalapathi in regard to&nbsp; effe=\r\nctt of &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sade Saati and&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Satu=\r\nrn`s Transitin general.&nbsp; To minimise the ill-effects of the transit&lt;sp=\r\nan\n style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;( Sanichaaram),&lt;/span&gt; I would propose ch=\r\nanting of certain Stotras and Mantras which many of you might be already kn=\r\nowing and chanting also.
