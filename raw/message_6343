I also consciously asked Nara=\r\nyan that i dont know if you(narayan) like this text or not, so let me know.=\r\n Just now when i saw your post i was overwhelmed with joy to see his/her gr=\r\nace in action.\n\nAfter reading this post of yours i know the essense of nara=\r\nyan and the fact that he loves Narayan hrudayam. \n- In this situation i can=\r\nt help questioning whether i am doing homam/puja/devotion or he is getting =\r\nit all done.\n\n\nForm your post I can see clearly the limitations of our cond=\r\nitioning. the need for both theoretical understanding and surrender is also=\r\n aptly summarized by you. \n\n\nQuestion\n- How does one directly generate imme=\r\nnse love/devotion/surrender? it will be nice if you can share your learning=\r\n on this.\n\n\nregards\nPriyank\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Priyank ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Your suggesti=\r\non is good and I will consider it in future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Narayana is Saguna a=\r\ns well as Nirguna. As a prayer says, &quot;saguNaM \n&gt; cha guNaatItaM&quot;. He does e=\r\nxist with attributes and yet he is also beyond \n&gt; attributes.\n&gt; \n&gt; It depen=\r\nds on how you approach Narayana. You can go with the saguna form \n&gt; and ima=\r\ngine Narayana as a god with 4 or 1000 hands, sustaining the \n&gt; world, givin=\r\ng this or that, taking care of this or that, etc. You can \n&gt; also choose to=\r\n worship the nirguna Narayana, who fills the entire \n&gt; universe, from plane=\r\nts to atoms to sub-atomic particles. Everything in \n&gt; the universe is Naray=\r\nana&#39;s manifestation.\n&gt; \n&gt; But then, how do you worship this nirguna Narayan=\r\na? Do you offer \n&gt; flowers? Well, flowers are Narayana too. Narayana (you) =\r\noffering \n&gt; Narayana (flowers) to Narayana. What&#39;s the point? Moreover, flo=\r\nwers and \n&gt; garbage are both Narayana. Then why offer flowers and not garba=\r\nge?\n&gt; \n&gt; As you can see, our notion of worship is heavily conditioned by ou=\r\nr own \n&gt; sense of good and bad, desirable and undesirable. Though we \n&gt; the=\r\noretically know that flowers and garbage are both Narayana, we cannot \n&gt; wo=\r\nrship god with garbage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once the theoretical understanding of all bein=\r\ng Narayana is deeply \n&gt; ingrained in one&#39;s consciousness, one will not be a=\r\nttracted towards or \n&gt; repelled by anything. If a desire (or rather sankalp=\r\na) arises in the \n&gt; mind, one may pursue it, but with no attraction or repu=\r\nlsion towards the \n&gt; object of that desire. The result of the pursuit will =\r\nnot matter and one \n&gt; will be neither happy nor sad no matter what happens.=\r\n One acts in the \n&gt; world, but with no attachment. This is the state descri=\r\nbed in Bhagavad \n&gt; Gita as &quot;sthitadhIrmunirucyate&quot;. If one reaches that sta=\r\nte, every action \n&gt; of that person is a worship of nirguna Narayana (becaus=\r\ne that person \n&gt; fully realizes and acknowledges Narayana in everything).\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; It is almost impossible to worship nirguna. As Sri Robert Svoboda \n&gt; co=\r\nrrectly said below, saguna worship is easier. You take a form of god \n&gt; wit=\r\nh some attributes, surrender to that form completely and identify \n&gt; with t=\r\nhat form completely. At the back of your mind, you can also have \n&gt; the not=\r\nion that that form is a specific manifestation of Nirguna \n&gt; Parabrahma.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Film=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @ho=\r\nmam108\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, May 17, 2011 at 11:45 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Na=\r\nmaste PVR,\n&gt; \n&gt; I read the generic manual and i think the explanation of th=\r\ne various \n&gt; deities is very very beautiful, relevant and apt. i will sugge=\r\nst that it \n&gt; should be added in our normal manuals also.

It \n&gt; &gt; allows non-Hindus to incorporate their faith and sa=\r\ncred chants of \n&gt; &gt; their faith into a fire ritual procedure that is essent=\r\nially taken \n&gt; &gt; from Hinduism.

The goal is to \n&gt; &gt; enable as many people a=\r\ns possible to approach the divine via the \n&gt; &gt; sacred medium of fire.\n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; &gt; A few months back, Manish sat next to an American la=\r\ndy in a flight. \n&gt; &gt; His intuition told him to tell her a few things. He to=\r\nld her a few \n&gt; &gt; things that would happen in the next few months. He told =\r\nher she MUST \n&gt; &gt; do a fire ritual regularly to overcome some serious probl=\r\nems in her \n&gt; &gt; life. He also gave her his email address. She told me later=\r\n that she \n&gt; &gt; thought he was &quot;insane&quot; to talk to a stranger like that. Lat=\r\ner, when \n&gt; &gt; some specific things happened as told by Manish, some to the =\r\nday, she \n&gt; &gt; developed trust in Manish (Manish told me he was just acting =\r\non his \n&gt; &gt; intuition withought knowing why). She emailed him and later tal=\r\nked to \n&gt; &gt; him. Manish re-iterated to her that she MUST do fire ritual to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; overcome current and future problems and he put her in touch with me.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but it was Greek and Latin \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to her. She is a practicing Christian and does not know much about \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHinduism. She was totally lost in in the manual and could not put it \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no use, though she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spent an hour \n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nn phone with her and explained a simple procedure that she could \n&gt; &gt; relat=\r\ne to, remember and do. She did homam a few times and found it to \n&gt; &gt; have =\r\na soothing and calming influence, though she was very nervous, \n&gt; &gt; afraid =\r\nand tense when she started out. Another friend of her, also a \n&gt; &gt; practici=\r\nng Christian with open-mindedness to other practices, was also \n&gt; &gt; interes=\r\nted in trying fire ritual and asked for info. This made me \n&gt; &gt; think of wr=\r\niting a manual suitable for a group currenly left out.\n&gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt; Coincidentally, Manish, I and a few other friends had a discussion =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; month back about non-Hindus performing fire ritual. Though some \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n sincere and learned friends had reservations, I opined: &quot;If one cannot \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; relate to a Sanskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin or Greek or \n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nrabic chant, I see no problem in offering that to god. I do not \n&gt; &gt; really=\r\n think Agni will say &quot;I do not know that god and cannot carry \n&gt; &gt; the offe=\r\nring to that god&quot;. I do not see gods as Hindu gods and \n&gt; &gt; non-Hindu gods =\r\nand see all of them as personifications of various \n&gt; &gt; natures and qualiti=\r\nes inherent to us. I reckon that Agni is capable of \n&gt; &gt; translating. Thus,=\r\n I am not averse to enabling non-Hindus to do a fire \n&gt; &gt; ritual by essenti=\r\nally retaining the basic homam structure, but \n&gt; &gt; replacing the main mantr=\r\na of pradhaana homam section with a \n&gt; &gt; non-Sanskrit sacred chant.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nhad copied Sri Robert Svoboda (author of Aghora series on \n&gt; &gt; Vimalananda)=\r\n on that discussion. He put his view on record in a \n&gt; &gt; private email: &quot;Ju=\r\nst for the record, my view is very similar to yours \n&gt; &gt; =C3=A2=C2=80&quot; the =\r\nimportant thing is to create a relationship with fire, and via \n&gt; &gt; the fir=\r\ne, with Brahman, Nirguna or Saguna =C3=A2=C2=80&quot; Saguna being much \n&gt; &gt; eas=\r\nier. There are many devatas in the world, and I too do not really \n&gt; &gt; thin=\r\nk Agni will say &quot;I do not know that god and cannot carry the \n&gt; &gt; offering =\r\nto that god&quot;. I too do not see gods as Hindu gods and \n&gt; &gt; non-Hindu gods; =\r\nif Agni can be purohit for one, he can be purohit for \n&gt; &gt; any.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt; &gt; If you know of some people who are not well-versed in Hin=\r\nduism but are \n&gt; &gt; open-minded to try new spiritual practices, please feel =\r\nfree to point \n&gt; &gt; them to this document.\n&gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
