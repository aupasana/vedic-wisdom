Once I was doing aarti with handbell ringing in my prayer =\r\nroom when some body climbed on my first floor window to see what I was doin=\r\ng.=A0\nLuckily I did not go out to see as there were several youths standing=\r\n and it might have turned it to sad situation.\nI stopped using that hand be=\r\nll and purchased a new bell. Up to few years back when my mother&#39;s health w=\r\nas good she would do purnimavrat and in the evening do the aarti after doin=\r\ng katha. I would ring the hand bell but was always alert. Over the years we=\r\n have experienced a lot of aggression but saved by the Grace of Divine Moth=\r\ner.What really can you do ??\nTanvirbhai seems to have some sort of special =\r\ninner wisdom as he went to India just to learn about haven. It is such a bi=\r\ng thing and now he is doing haven on a regular basis. Sooner or later his n=\r\neighbours or friend will learn what he is doing. Only time will tell what w=\r\nill then happen.\nWhen I was living in Vrindavan I heard =A0a Swamiji tellin=\r\ng a story. It seems a Muslim man was having a land dispute with Swamiji&#39;s a=\r\nshram or some neighbour and there was some court case. One day Swamiji met =\r\nthis man in the street and they were talking about this dispute. This man s=\r\naid, I am a true Muslim and I have plenty of money and I could go to anothe=\r\nr town easily. Then he pointed towards one of the main Temple and said I do=\r\n not want to leave HIM and I want to stay with HIM here in Vrindavan and th=\r\nen he started to cry.\n\nJadooVo Jo Ser Per Char Kar Bole\n\nThanks\nLaxmiNaraya=\r\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;=\r\n\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: W=\r\nednesday, 28 March 2012, 3:18\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: First homam e=\r\nxperience\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNamasteBiswaji,\n\nAll I meant was it is hard to perform hi=\r\nndu rituals in muslim dominated countries and how god makes/helps his devot=\r\nees do homams even in muslim land, that&#39;s all, there&#39;s no talk of discrimin=\r\nation here. \n\n\nWith due respect may I request you to not draw harsh conclus=\r\nions without clarification.

That is why.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; My two cents :\n&gt; \n&gt; To make dry coconut you n=\r\need heat more than the sunlight. Yes the coconut will rot if you keep it ou=\r\ntside in the sun for so long. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I long back saw in Food TV in US....=\r\n.he kept the whole coconut in conventional oven for one hour. Then he broke=\r\n the shell with a hammer. The shell came out easily and the whole coconut s=\r\ntayed intact. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think once the shell comes out put the whole cocon=\r\nut in oven again, that way the water will dry out and you will get a dry co=\r\nconut.=C2=A0 You can shake the coconut to see if there is water inside or n=\r\not and accordingly experiment. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this works...good luck with yo=\r\nur homams.

I thank you=\r\n for guiding me so detailed... without your manual it would never be possib=\r\nle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting point to note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and=\r\n stayed with a Brahmin family for about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my =\r\nvisit was to learn doing homam! However I was disappoint because their proc=\r\nedure was so big that it would take about 3 hours for the homam, and many m=\r\nore materials also. Of course, they learnt it from &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it was =\r\ntheir own tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [NarasimhaJi=\r\n] who could compare many traditions, research on them, and even come up wit=\r\nh a shorter version. They had no idea that a shorter version is possible, o=\r\nr something can be left out. As an example, they suggested a mantadoryjapam=\r\n of 10x times before I do an &#39;x&#39; times offering in homam, and many more for=\r\nmalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I knew in Bangladesh I would never have so much material=\r\ns needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so i=\r\nt was of no use. \n&gt; \n&gt; Much later when I was reading your manual, I remembe=\r\nr about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway Ji...\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Everything was almost as per recommendation, except I used a melamine sp=\r\noon to offer ghee, because I couldn&#39;t manage a wooden spoon even after a lo=\r\nt of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to work much hard=\r\n to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.\n&gt; \n&gt; I burnt the fire =\r\nwith mango-wood and jute-sticks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Purnahuti with ghee only.\n&gt; \n&gt; That W=\r\nAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the wo=\r\nods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I knew that with a =\r\nbig stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive long to allow =\r\nme meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I=\r\n could not meditate.\n&gt; \n&gt; My first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion ho=\r\nw can I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins allow=\r\ning me mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would still burn =\r\nout fast...\n&gt; \n&gt; Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing th=\r\nat would keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anoth=\r\ner Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, =\r\nI can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as sugge=\r\nsted in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut=\r\n so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced=\r\n coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will no=\r\nt it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here n=\r\no one has any idea about that, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnab=\r\nle&quot; full coconuts. That is why.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantras work very strong for me. But I=\r\n feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had v=\r\nery strong experiences with homam before while performing with others. Even=\r\n a few times I *arranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a st=\r\nrong effect working on me also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Today with the homam, the effect was n=\r\not that strong. I know why, because it was a super-short homam, with many m=\r\nantras left. Also, I should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesh=\r\na and Lord Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Bec=\r\nause, I was worried and nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% f=\r\nocus on their presence. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I am going to add mantras from the main homam soon, common mantras whi=\r\nch are needed in all homams like Anugya, KalashaSuddhi, Agni Deva prayer et=\r\nc. Also I guess Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very important.\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\ny the way I did 108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offe=\r\nrings with the smallest Shani mantra again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am thankful to the ultim=\r\nate divinity that at least I didn&#39;t have any negative experience after the =\r\nhomam. I was pretty nervous about the possibility. Because long back in 200=\r\n2-2003 when I started mantras, almost everyday I faced negative energies fo=\r\nr the imperfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives=\r\n were so strong. But I didn&#39;t give up and tried to understand the correct w=\r\nays because since I saw the power in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way=\r\n to get the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example, you [Nar=\r\nasimhaJi] instructed to stay in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find =\r\nthis 100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no website or almost=\r\n no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantra=\r\ns work very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative e=\r\nffects when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own e=\r\nxperience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]=\r\n! Now days, I can&#39;t eat anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in =\r\nthe evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat something as I s=\r\nometimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I ha=\r\nve no choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the thing I appreciate about you [NarasimhaJi] t=\r\no make the small [yet very important] things always mentioned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same th=\r\ning about your instruction of minimum movement of the body, I find it very =\r\ncorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway Ji I guess I am stretching my mail very long...\n&gt; \n&gt; m=\r\ny 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expression of the ul=\r\ntimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods&#39; mantras in fire to=\r\no. Can I do a Navagrahahomam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such as Surya, Chandra, K=\r\nuja and so on?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Is there any exceptional instruction while doing hom=\r\nam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wanted to mention that I=\r\n am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deities but manuals=\r\n for those deities are already there, hence these additional questions abou=\r\nt graha-homams.\n&gt; \n&gt; Appreciate your time to answer me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanking you a=\r\ngain,\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--1972604429-1902669487-1333378770=:20487\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hello,&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Living outside India and following Santana &lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nmisspell-0&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;Dhrama&lt;/span&gt; brings different sort of problems.

In India, we kept the mature coconut in a dry place... =\r\nover the time(3 to 6 months) the outside skin of the coconut becomes dry...=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n2. Full coconut(with skin) resembles the human head, burning the =\r\nfull coconut resembles the burning of our ego(I-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-38&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ness&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3.

HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut =\r\nso much that it becomes BURNABLE for &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-54&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;purnahuti&lt;/span&gt;? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a =\r\nfull coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotten or something? =\r\nAny procedure? I am &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; asking this because here no one has any idea =\r\nabout that, because no one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; even thinks of having &quot;burnable&quot; full =\r\ncoconuts. That is why.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; My two cents :&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; To make dry coconut you need heat more than the sunlight. Yes the coconut=\r\n will rot if you keep it outside in the sun for so long. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I long back saw in Food TV in US.....he kept the whole coconut =\r\nin conventional oven for one hour. Then he broke the shell with a hammer. T=\r\nhe shell came out easily and the whole coconut stayed intact. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I think once the shell comes out put the whole coconut in =\r\noven again, that way the water will dry out and you will get a dry coconut.=\r\n=C2&nbsp; You can shake the coconut to see if there is water inside or not =\r\nand accordingly experiment. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hope this works..=\r\n.good luck with your &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-55&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homams&lt;/span&gt;.=\r\n Its amazing how god makes his devotees do &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-56&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homams&lt;/span&gt; even in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-57&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;mus=\r\nlim&lt;/span&gt; land. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;span=\r\n id=3D&quot;misspell-58&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Priya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\nFrom: king_&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-59&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;tanvir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;lord_r=\r\nex@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 25,=\r\n 2012 6:05 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] First &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-6=\r\n1&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt; experience&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C2=\r\n&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-62&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namaste&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-63&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narasimha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-=\r\n64&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ji&lt;/span&gt; and other members&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have pe=\r\nrformed a super-short Shani &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-65&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Homam&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; this evening. I thank you for guiding me so detailed... without your =\r\nmanual it would never be possible.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Interesting point to =\r\nnote, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a &lt;span id=3D&quot;mis=\r\nspell-66&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Brahmin&lt;/span&gt; family for about 10 days and the ON=\r\nLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-67&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt;! However I was disappoint because their procedure was s=\r\no big that it would take about 3 hours for the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-68&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt;, and many more materials also. Of course, they lea=\r\nrnt it from &#39;guru-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-69&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;kulam&lt;/span&gt;&#39; and=\r\n it was their own tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [&lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-70&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narasimha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-=\r\n71&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ji&lt;/span&gt;] who could compare many traditions, research o=\r\nn them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a sh=\r\norter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an example, the=\r\ny suggested a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-72&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;mantadory&lt;/span&gt;\n &lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-73&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japam&lt;/span&gt; of 10x times before I do =\r\nan &#39;x&#39; times offering in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-74&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;, and many more formalities.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So, I knew in Bangladesh =\r\nI would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to per=\r\nform a 3 hour &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-75&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt; regularl=\r\ny, so it was of no use. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Much later when I was reading y=\r\nour manual, I remember about &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-76&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Achama=\r\nnan&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-77&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Raksha&lt;/span&gt; etc. from=\r\n their teaching :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anyway &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-78&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ji&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Everything was almost as per rec=\r\nommendation, except I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn=\r\n&#39;t manage a wooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I have to order=\r\n it... but I will have to work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a=\r\n spoon with wood.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I burnt the fire with mango-wood and j=\r\nute-sticks.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-79&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Purn=\r\nahuti&lt;/span&gt; with ghee only.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That WAS the problem. Soon =\r\nafter starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the woods were burning. So =\r\nwhile I was moving with the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-80&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-81&quot; =\r\nclass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;purnahuti&lt;/span&gt;, the fire will not survive long to allow me=\r\n meditate even 5 &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-82&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt;. Becau=\r\nse the woods were burning out fast.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So I could not medit=\r\nate.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; My first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how =\r\ncan I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 &lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nmisspell-83&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; allowing me mediate? I noted even i=\r\nf I had put much wood, they would still burn out fast...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would keep th=\r\ne fire alive for 10-15 &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-84&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; =\r\nand let me meditate.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Another Q. - 2) I have sliced cocon=\r\nut &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-85&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;copras&lt;/span&gt; and drying them fo=\r\nr last 3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can =\r\nuse them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry=\r\n a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much that it becomes BURNABLE for &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell=\r\n-86&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;purnahuti&lt;/span&gt;? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts..=\r\n. but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rot=\r\nten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no one has a=\r\nny idea about that, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnable&quot; full co=\r\nconuts. That is why.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Mantras work very strong for me. Bu=\r\nt I feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects. I have ha=\r\nd very strong experiences with &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-87&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homa=\r\nm&lt;/span&gt; before while performing with others. Even a few times I *arranged*=\r\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-88&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homams&lt;/span&gt; for others and I alw=\r\nays directly felt a strong effect working on me also.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To=\r\nday with the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-89&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt;, the effe=\r\nct was not that strong. I know why, because it was a super-short &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-90&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt;, with many mantras left. Also,=\r\n I should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani D=\r\neva in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worrie=\r\nd and nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their pres=\r\nence. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I am going to add mantras from the main &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-91&quot; class=3D&quot;=\r\nmark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt; soon, common mantras which are needed in all &lt;span id=3D=\r\n&quot;misspell-92&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homams&lt;/span&gt; like &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-93&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Anugya&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-94&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Kalasha=\r\n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-95&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Suddhi&lt;/span&gt;, Agni Deva pr=\r\nayer etc. Also I guess &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-96&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Avahana&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;-related Sanskrit mantras are very important.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; By the w=\r\nay I did 108 offerings with Veda-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-97&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Vy=\r\nasa&lt;/span&gt; Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shani mantr=\r\na again.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at =\r\nleast I didn&#39;t have any negative experience after the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-=\r\n98&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt;. I was pretty nervous about the possibility=\r\n. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, almost everyday I =\r\nfaced negative energies for the imperfection of pronunciation and procedure=\r\ns. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn&#39;t give up and tried t=\r\no understand the correct ways because since I saw the power in it, I had to=\r\n find what&#39;s the right way to get the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As an example, you [&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-99&quot; class=3D&quot;mark=\r\n&quot;&gt;Narasimha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-100&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ji&lt;/span&gt;] inst=\r\nructed to stay in an empty stomach while doing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-101&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt;. I find this 100% true from my mantra &lt;span id=3D=\r\n&quot;misspell-102&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japam&lt;/span&gt; experience. Though no website or=\r\n almost no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspel=\r\nl-103&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japam&lt;/span&gt;, I found that mantras work very strong w=\r\nith empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;misspell-104&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japam&lt;/span&gt; after my dinner. Thus, =\r\nI &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-105&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;learned&lt;/span&gt; this from my own =\r\nexperience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong &lt;span id=3D&quot;mis=\r\nspell-106&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;practices&lt;/span&gt; I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat an=\r\nything after my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it b=\r\necomes very difficult not to eat\n something as I sometimes hang out with fr=\r\niends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; That is the thing I appreciate about you [&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-107&quot;=\r\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narasimha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-108&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;J=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;] to make the small [yet very important] things always mentioned.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Same thing about your instruction of minimum movement of =\r\nthe body, I find it very correct.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anyway &lt;span id=3D&quot;mis=\r\nspell-109&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ji&lt;/span&gt; I guess I am stretching my mail very lo=\r\nng...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani =\r\nas an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer othe=\r\nr Gods&#39; mantras in fire too. Can I do a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-110&quot; class=3D&quot;=\r\nmark&quot;&gt;Navagraha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-111&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span=\r\n&gt; this way, or at least a &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-112&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; for 6-7 &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-113&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;grahas&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4) If yes, should I maintain the &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-114&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;graha&lt;/span&gt; order such as Surya, Chandra, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell=\r\n-115&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Kuja&lt;/span&gt; and so on?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 5) Is there =\r\nany exceptional instruction while doing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-116&quot; class=3D&quot;=\r\nmark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-117&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Rahu&lt;/span&gt; =\r\nand &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-118&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ketu&lt;/span&gt; etc., or just like=\r\n Shani?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Wanted to mention that I am also planning to do =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-119&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homam&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspe=\r\nll-120&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Maha&lt;/span&gt; Lakshmi and other deities but manuals fo=\r\nr those deities are already there, hence these additional questions about &lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;misspell-121&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;graha&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-1=\r\n22&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;homams&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Appreciate your time t=\r\no answer me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanking you again,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;mi=\r\nsspell-123&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Tanvir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n   =\r\n \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:white;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1972604429-1902669487-1333378770=:20487--\r\n\n"}}
