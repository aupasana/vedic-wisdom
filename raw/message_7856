I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough=\r\n. Obviously, \n\n&gt; these are not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (exter=\r\nnal \n\n&gt; communication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something mo=\r\nre \n\n&gt; than vaikhari in the following words so that people can understand \n=\r\n\n&gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering your questions is \n\n&gt; obvi=\r\nously not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perhaps benefit \n\n&gt; some o=\r\nthers who may be ready - now or in future).\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; The problem is not identification. The problem is *conditioning* (likes,=\r\n \n\n&gt; dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification and use o=\r\nf \n\n&gt; what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara (identification) \n\n&gt;=\r\n evaporates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is normal mukti. \n=\r\n\n&gt; If ahamkara (identification) remains while chitta (conditioning) is \n\n&gt; =\r\ncleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as that.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If one engages in an action with zero conditioning, then the=\r\nre is no \n\n&gt; karma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or men=\r\ntal) by \n\n&gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions t=\r\nhat bind \n\n&gt; one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. con=\r\nditioning \n\n&gt; in chitta) behind an action that bind one!\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identi=\r\nfied with a \n\n&gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some condit=\r\nioning, \n\n&gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!),=\r\n then \n\n&gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction which will=\r\n in due \n\n&gt; time give a particular reaction to what one identified with whe=\r\nn \n\n&gt; engaging in that action.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; By the time the reaction is experienc=\r\ned, all the conditioning may be \n\n&gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta=\r\n. Yet, the momentum set in motion \n\n&gt; before one became jeevanmukta will co=\r\nntinue to affect the body, senses \n\n&gt; and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s=\r\n ahamkara is identifying with. But, \n\n&gt; because there is no conditioning an=\r\nd hence no agendas, no desires, no \n\n&gt; likes and dislikes, one neither rejo=\r\nices nor protests nor tries to \n\n&gt; modify the happenings to what one is ide=\r\nntifying with.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Sensing that there is a pa=\r\nin requires no conditioning. It is the \n\n&gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra.=\r\n Observing that there is more pain in \n\n&gt; the evening than morning (or when=\r\n swallowing) requires no conditioning. \n\n&gt; It is the function of buddhi, i.=\r\ne. Budha. But thinking of praying to god \n\n&gt; to reduce pain requires condit=\r\nioning in chitta (absent in a \n\n&gt; jeevanmukta!).\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Though a jeevanmukt=\r\na is identifying with a body, one does not view it as \n\n&gt; something his own=\r\n and something that must be kept in a particular state. \n\n&gt; He identifies w=\r\nith it, but has no agendas for it. All that comes from \n\n&gt; conditioning in =\r\nchitta, which is absent now!\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated=\r\n I-ness) views what one \n\n&gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions bor=\r\nrowed from various \n\n&gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, M=\r\nitra, Varuna, Time \n\n&gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. O=\r\nne does not view it \n\n&gt; from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to =\r\npursue X or Y \n\n&gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of portio=\r\nns borrowed \n\n&gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestations of Light.=\r\n I observe \n\n&gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda pursue u=\r\nsing them.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, =\r\nas well as \n\n&gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were discussing a while back.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; =\r\nI repeat, identification is not the problem. It is the conditioning that \n\n=\r\n&gt; drives how one uses what one identifies with, that is the problem.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself better,=\r\n though, given how subtle \n\n&gt; and nuanced this knowledge is, some people ma=\r\ny still get confused (if \n\n&gt; so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just k=\r\neep doing sadhana, for \n\n&gt; that&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful=\r\n to Manish and Maharshi \n\n&gt; Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.\n\n&gt; \n\n=\r\n&gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got throat cancer because of his \n\n&gt; &quot;ins=\r\nult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the kaarmik power of \n\n&gt; attorney=\r\n from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be \n\n&gt; debated.

If \n\n&gt; &gt; so, Why did he su=\r\nffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying \n\n&gt; &gt; with his actions?

Manish loosely \n\n&gt; &gt; (in my view) said in this exchange th=\r\nat rinas are of body and a \n\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rina=\r\ns.\n\n&gt; &gt; But body is an insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are no=\r\nt \n\n&gt; &gt; of the body, but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; antahkaranas of mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta \n\n&gt; &gt; (memory/condit=\r\nioning) - that are the source of various rinas, \n\n&gt; &gt; particularly chitta. =\r\nAs mind identifies with a body, it projects its \n\n&gt; &gt; rinas on the body and=\r\n makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in \n\n&gt; &gt; accordance with thos=\r\ne rinas/conditioning.\n\n&gt; &gt; If the conditioning in chitta is completely wipe=\r\nd out and ahamkara \n\n&gt; &gt; merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the cond=\r\nitioning in chitta \n\n&gt; &gt; is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara continues=\r\n to exist with no \n\n&gt; &gt; limiting notions (it is basically the conditioning =\r\nin chitta that is \n\n&gt; &gt; limiting), then one becomes jeevanmukta (liberated =\r\nwhile living).\n\n&gt; &gt; Unlike in the case of one who leaves body and gets mukt=\r\ni, a \n\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness (but which is not limite=\r\nd by \n\n&gt; &gt; any notions or conditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does pro=\r\nject \n\n&gt; &gt; into a body. But it does not say &quot;I am this body and hence this =\r\nbody \n\n&gt; &gt; should be kept healthy or strong&quot; (THAT would be conditioning in=\r\n \n\n&gt; &gt; chitta, which is wiped out now!). On the other hand, it does not \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; either say &quot;this body should be ignored and destroyed&quot;. Though \n\n&gt; &gt; con=\r\nditioning is absent now, body keeps experiencing and doing things \n\n&gt; &gt; bas=\r\ned on the *momentum* set in motion before one became jeevanmukta \n\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nengaged in conditioned experiences and actions. This is like a fan \n\n&gt; &gt; tu=\r\nrning for a while after the electricity has been stopped.\n\n&gt; &gt; Manas, buddh=\r\ni and indriyas keep working as they did before. If one has \n\n&gt; &gt; throat can=\r\ncer, indriyas may sense pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may \n\n&gt; &gt; process =\r\nthat input and register pain. Buddhi may analyze various \n\n&gt; &gt; observations=\r\n and draw various conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to \n\n&gt; &gt; swallow fo=\r\nod, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal \n\n&gt; &gt; liquid, it fee=\r\nls better&quot; etc). A normal person whose conditioned mind \n\n&gt; &gt; (chitta) says=\r\n &quot;I should overcome and not have this pain&quot; may think of \n\n&gt; &gt; various thin=\r\ngs to do and struggle with them. But an unconditioned \n\n&gt; &gt; being has no su=\r\nch considerations. Though one may feel and express the \n\n&gt; &gt; pain and other=\r\n objective experiences, one reacts to it differently.\n\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0* =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0*\n\n&gt; &gt; This is a key point:\n\n&gt; &gt; Manas and buddhi are good =\r\nat making objective observations and \n\n&gt; &gt; rational deductions, but, by the=\r\nmselves, they do not have ANY agenda. \n\n&gt; &gt; They neither like something nor=\r\n dislike something. THAT comes from the \n\n&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta! The h=\r\nallmark of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is \n\n&gt; &gt; absent!\n\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0* =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0*\n\n&gt; &gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot ques=\r\ntion. A better way \n\n&gt; &gt; to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get=\r\n throat cancer and \n\n&gt; &gt; feel pain? How is it possible if there are no karm=\r\nas or rinas left?\n\n&gt; &gt; I have already answered it. But, let me sum it up br=\r\niefly again. Body, \n\n&gt; &gt; various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, man=\r\nas and buddhi of a \n\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I=\r\n-ness is intact and \n\n&gt; &gt; does project itself onto those. But neither I-nes=\r\ns nor those things \n\n&gt; &gt; carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository=\r\n of conditioning and \n\n&gt; &gt; rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions.=\r\n One&#39;s body, indriyas, \n\n&gt; &gt; manas & buddhi keep experiencing and doing thi=\r\nngs (good or bad!) based \n\n&gt; &gt; on the previous momentum set by the play of =\r\nrnas and karmas while some \n\n&gt; &gt; conditioning was left in chitta.\n\n&gt; &gt; Body=\r\n, various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are \n\n&gt; &gt; all p=\r\nortions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses \n\n&gt; &gt; sent=\r\nience into them by projecting awareness into them. The \n\n&gt; &gt; conditioning i=\r\nn chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and \n\n&gt; &gt; used. Instead of=\r\n looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or \n\n&gt; &gt; Mitra, one views i=\r\nt as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to conditioning \n\n&gt; &gt; in chitta. That =\r\nis what creates karmas and rinas. When that \n\n&gt; &gt; conditioning is *complete=\r\nly* overcome, ahamkara can still project \n\n&gt; &gt; awareness into those objects=\r\n, but it sees them for what they are. It \n\n&gt; &gt; does not have false and limi=\r\nting notions like &quot;this throat is mine and \n\n&gt; &gt; MUST feel nice and not fee=\r\nl painful&quot;.\n\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0* =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0 =C3=82=C2=A0*\n\n&gt; &gt; Most people who may =\r\nclaim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas are \n\n&gt; &gt; not really jeevanmuk=\r\ntas in today&#39;s world.\n\n&gt; &gt; If one wants to understand the state of jeevanmu=\r\nkti, Yoga Vaasishtham \n\n&gt; &gt; is the best book. The entire discourse by Mahar=\r\nshi Vasishtha to Lord \n\n&gt; &gt; Rama is a detailed and elaborate definition and=\r\n characterization of a \n\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta.\n\n&gt; &gt; There may be other books tha=\r\nt explain better how to do various \n\n&gt; &gt; sadhanas to progress spiritually a=\r\nnd get closer to being liberated \n\n&gt; &gt; oneday. But, when it comes elaborati=\r\nng what liberation while living \n\n&gt; &gt; actually is, there is none better tha=\r\nn Yoga Vaasishtham. Of course, \n\n&gt; &gt; one can say that this is merely an int=\r\nellectual exercise as far as \n\n&gt; &gt; *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as no=\r\nne of may ever become a \n\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta..\n\n&gt; &gt; One word of caution: I wri=\r\nte with a very confident tone when I have \n\n&gt; &gt; strong conviction in what I=\r\n write.

Nothing really, \n\n&gt; &gt; fulfilling all rn=\r\nas, wait for rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a \n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in =\r\n&quot;fulfilling all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? \n\n&gt; &gt; If no, y r they called =\r\nrnas? If yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, \n\n&gt; &gt; rnas will work out themse=\r\nlves, slowly or fast as may be the case. The \n\n&gt; &gt; rnas are of the body he =\r\nor she occupies. He is mukta because he \n\n&gt; &gt; experiences, actually sees th=\r\ne rnas to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply \n\n&gt; &gt; to the body, not to you. You=\r\n are that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call \n\n&gt; &gt; it what you want, Atma, et=\r\nc. Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent \n\n&gt; &gt; light was never bound. So=\r\n, who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it \n\n&gt; &gt; have rnas? If these &quot;rn=\r\nas of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one \n\n&gt; &gt; bcomes jeevanmukta, wha=\r\nt happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. \n\n&gt; &gt; The mind thought, that, =\r\nit was the body, instead of this light. That \n\n&gt; &gt; is the original problem.=\r\n Which every being is born with. Rnas arise \n\n&gt; &gt; from this identification =\r\nwhich creates karma. U r not that, so u r not \n\n&gt; &gt; bound, when the mind re=\r\nalises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite \n\n&gt; &gt; true, since u r that &quot;L=\r\night&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the \n\n&gt; &gt; rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as u =\r\nsaid r of the mind? When a mind identifies \n\n&gt; &gt; with light & bcomes mukta,=\r\n does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas \n\n&gt; &gt; projected into mind, are ac=\r\nted on and may be experienced by body. So, \n\n&gt; &gt; why is a jeevanmukta subje=\r\nct to this? because, that person although \n\n&gt; &gt; aware of the light at all t=\r\nimes, and of the causal n subtle bodies, \n\n&gt; &gt; has not yet directed d mind =\r\nto identify as that light at all times, \n\n&gt; &gt; key word being &quot;all&quot;. This gi=\r\nves karmas time to work. Next stage is \n\n&gt; &gt; 24/7 id with light Narasimha: =\r\nAs per my understanding, the person u r \n\n&gt; &gt; defining is not a jeevanmukta=\r\n. He may b an elevated being, but not \n\n&gt; &gt; mukta (liberated) yet. Manish: =\r\nI derive that definition of this \n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;state&quot; from somebody, no problem in=\r\n disagreement. 24/7 identification \n\n&gt; &gt; with light, most likely body shoul=\r\nd not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with \n\n&gt; &gt; light forever with body dropping =\r\noff is just mukti, not jivanmukti! \n\n&gt; &gt; Jivanmukti is where body stays. Is=\r\n body really different from light? \n\n&gt; &gt; In fact, is there anything other t=\r\nhan light? Jivanmukti is seeing the \n\n&gt; &gt; play of objects but seeing all as=\r\n light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n\n&gt; &gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt =\r\n&quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n\n&gt; &gt; that means u dont owe anybody =\r\nanything once u r truly free. Words like \n\n&gt; &gt; free, liberated & jivanmukta=\r\n r often misused. Manish: Will explain a \n\n&gt; &gt; bit in detail sometime. Nara=\r\nsimha: OK. :-) But, as far as &quot;explaining&quot; \n\n&gt; &gt; is concerned, Vasishtha ex=\r\nplained as clearly & elaborately as any \n\n&gt; &gt; human being can ever hope 2. =\r\nManish: The question to my mind is this: \n\n&gt; &gt; was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukt=\r\na? If so, Why did he suffer with throat \n\n&gt; &gt; cancer if he was not identify=\r\ning with his actions? (according to your \n\n&gt; &gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s=\r\n definition??) Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt \n\n&gt; &gt; give a single definition. H=\r\nis entire discourse 2 Rama is a definition \n\n&gt; &gt; of jeevanmukta!

I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough=\r\n. Obviously, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; these are not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari =\r\n(external &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; communication). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe =\r\nsomething more &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; than vaikhari in the following words so that peopl=\r\ne can understand &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; better (not you Manish, the goal of answering yo=\r\nur questions is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but=\r\n to perhaps benefit &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; some others who may be ready - now or in futu=\r\nre).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The problem =\r\nis not identification. The problem is *conditioning* (likes, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; disl=\r\nikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification and use of &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara (identification) &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; evaporates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is normal mukti=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If ahamkara (identification) remains while chitta (conditioning=\r\n) is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as that.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If one engages in an =\r\naction with zero conditioning, then there is no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; karma and there a=\r\nre no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; themselves d=\r\no not bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that bind &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one! =\r\nIt is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. conditioning &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; in chitta) behind an action that bind one!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but c=\r\nlose) identified with a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; body and engaged in an action that IS dri=\r\nven by some conditioning, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that =\r\nconditioning may be (!), then &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that sets in motion the law of kaar=\r\nmik action-reaction which will in due &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; time give a particular reac=\r\ntion to what one identified with when &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; engaging in that action.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, all the condition=\r\ning may be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet, the mome=\r\nntum set in motion &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; before one became jeevanmukta will continue to=\r\n affect the body, senses &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ah=\r\namkara is identifying with. But, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; because there is no conditioning=\r\n and hence no agendas, no desires, no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; likes and dislikes, one nei=\r\nther rejoices nor protests nor tries to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; modify the happenings to =\r\nwhat one is identifying with.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is t=\r\nhe &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more =\r\npain in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no=\r\n conditioning. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thin=\r\nking of praying to god &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to reduce pain requires conditioning in ch=\r\nitta (absent in a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; jeevanmukta!).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Though a jeev=\r\nanmukta is identifying with a body, one does not view it as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; somet=\r\nhing his own and something that must be kept in a particular state. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; He identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. All that comes from &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; conditioning in chitta, which is absent now!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The=\r\n unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ident=\r\nifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; deit=\r\nies (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. One does not view it &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of portions borrow=\r\ned &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestations of Light. I =\r\nobserve &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda pursu=\r\ne using them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yog=\r\na Vaasishtham, as well as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were discussing =\r\na while back.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I repeat, identification is not the proble=\r\nm. It is the conditioning that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; drives how one uses what one ident=\r\nifies with, that is the problem.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself better, though, giv=\r\nen how subtle &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may stil=\r\nl get confused (if &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just k=\r\neep doing sadhana, for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that&#39;s the most important thing!).

Not that he was oblivious to the suffering.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And, we say th=\r\nat he was a Jeevanmukta.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So how can that happen, if according to t=\r\nhat definition, the mind must &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be identifying 24/7 with Atma to be=\r\n qualified as a Jeevanmukta?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The answer is straight forw=\r\nard.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I await your reply.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Kindest regards&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@... &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@...&#39;)&gt; &gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As twitter is too restrictive =\r\na medium, I want to answer a question &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that came up in an exc=\r\nhange between my guru Manish and me on Twitter, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; here. Some p=\r\nortions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at the end, in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ch=\r\nronological order, in case someone is interested in the background.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; I will answer the following question posed by Manish based on my &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; understanding:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my min=\r\nd is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; so, Why did he =\r\nsuffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with his=\r\n actions? (according to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; de=\r\nfinition??)&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp; =C3=82&nbsp;* =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;*&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish loose=\r\nly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body=\r\n and a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; But body is an insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of the body, but of the mind that identifies with it. It is =\r\nthe &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; antahkaranas of mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; (memory/conditioning) - that are the source of various rinas, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; particularly chitta. As mind identifies with a body, it projec=\r\nts its &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rinas on the body and makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and=\r\n &quot;do&quot; things, in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; accordance with those rinas/conditioning.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and aham=\r\nkara &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the condition=\r\ning in chitta &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara conti=\r\nnues to exist with no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; limiting notions (it is basically the =\r\nconditioning in chitta that is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; limiting), then one becomes j=\r\neevanmukta (liberated while living).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unlike in the case of on=\r\ne who leaves body and gets mukti, a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta continues to=\r\n have an I-ness (but which is not limited by &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; any notions or =\r\nconditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does project &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; into a=\r\n body. But it does not say &quot;I am this body and hence this body &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; should be kept healthy or strong&quot; (THAT would be conditioning in &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; chitta, which is wiped out now!). On the other hand, it does not &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; either say &quot;this body should be ignored and destroyed&quot;. Though=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditioning is absent now, body keeps experiencing and doi=\r\nng things &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; based on the *momentum* set in motion before one b=\r\necame jeevanmukta &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and engaged in conditioned experiences and=\r\n actions. This is like a fan &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; turning for a while after the e=\r\nlectricity has been stopped.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep =\r\nworking as they did before. If one has &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; throat cancer, indriy=\r\nas may sense pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; process th=\r\nat input and register pain. Buddhi may analyze various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; obser=\r\nvations and draw various conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; swallow food, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A normal person whose conditioned=\r\n mind &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome and not have this pai=\r\nn&quot; may think of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; various things to do and struggle with them.=\r\n But an unconditioned &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; being has no such considerations. Thou=\r\ngh one may feel and express the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pain and other objective exp=\r\neriences, one reacts to it differently.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82=\r\n&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;* =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;*&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a key point:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manas and bu=\r\nddhi are good at making objective observations and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rational =\r\ndeductions, but, by themselves, they do not have ANY agenda. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n They neither like something nor dislike something. THAT comes from the &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta! The hallmark of a jeevanmukta is that T=\r\nHAT is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; absent!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;* =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n*&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A=\r\n better way &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta g=\r\net throat cancer and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; feel pain? How is it possible if there =\r\nare no karmas or rinas left?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have already answered it. But,=\r\n let me sum it up briefly again. Body, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; various body parts, j=\r\nnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and buddhi of a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta =\r\ncontinue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness is intact and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; do=\r\nes project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor those things &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of conditioning an=\r\nd &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. One&#39;s bod=\r\ny, indriyas, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; manas &amp; buddhi keep experiencing and doing =\r\nthings (good or bad!) based &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on the previous momentum set by =\r\nthe play of rnas and karmas while some &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditioning was left=\r\n in chitta.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Body, various body parts, indriyas of jnana and k=\r\narma and manas are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; all portions borrowed from various deitie=\r\ns. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sentience into them by projecti=\r\nng awareness into them. The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta is what d=\r\nrives how all these are viewed and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; used. Instead of looking =\r\nat a sense organ as a portion of Indra or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mitra, one views i=\r\nt as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to conditioning &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in chit=\r\nta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditi=\r\noning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still project &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nwareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they are. It &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is mine =\r\nand &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;* =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;*&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most people who may claim to b=\r\ne (or think they are) jeevanmuktas are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not really jeevanmukt=\r\nas in today&#39;s world.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one wants to understand the state of =\r\njeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is the best book. The entire d=\r\niscourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rama is a detailed an=\r\nd elaborate definition and characterization of a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There may be other books that explain better how to do vari=\r\nous &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being=\r\n liberated &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liber=\r\nation while living &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; actually is, there is none better than Yo=\r\nga Vaasishtham. Of course, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; one can say that this is merely a=\r\nn intellectual exercise as far as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; *we* are concerned. It per=\r\nhaps is, as none of may ever become a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; One word of caution: I write with a very confident tone when I have &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; strong conviction in what I write. That is how I am. But I ca=\r\nn &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; definitely be wrong. So please feel free to ignore me! :-)=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best=\r\n regards, Narasimha &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------ &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Free Jyotish Software, Free J=\r\nyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;=\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Jyotish writings: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homa=\r\nm108 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Twitter exchange on jeevanmukta between Manish (twitter h=\r\nandle &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; @mmpandit) and Narasimha (twitter handle @homam108):&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manish: So, what is a jeevanmukta doing here? Nothing really, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fulfilling all rnas, wait for rnas to be over. Narasimha: If=\r\n a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling all rnas&quot;, will he b b=\r\nound again? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If no, y r they called rnas? If yes, y call him =\r\nmukta? Manish: No, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rnas will work out themselves, slowly or =\r\nfast as may be the case. The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rnas are of the body he or she =\r\noccupies. He is mukta because he &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; experiences, actually sees =\r\nthe rnas to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to the body, not =\r\nto you. You are that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; it wha=\r\nt you want, Atma, etc. Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; light was never bound. So, who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did &amp; does he=\r\n/it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have rnas? If these &quot;rnas of body&quot; r somehow not fulfill=\r\ned after one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bcomes jeevanmukta, what happens to one? :-) Ma=\r\nnish: You are right. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The mind thought, that, it was the body=\r\n, instead of this light. That &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is the original problem. Which=\r\n every being is born with. Rnas arise &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; from this identificati=\r\non which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bound, when=\r\n the mind realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; tr=\r\nue, since u r that &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with light &amp; bcomes mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: O=\r\nk, karmas &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; projected into mind, are acted on and may be exper=\r\nienced by body. So, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; why is a jeevanmukta subject to this? be=\r\ncause, that person although &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; aware of the light at all times,=\r\n and of the causal n subtle bodies, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; has not yet directed d m=\r\nind to identify as that light at all times, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; key word being &quot;=\r\nall&quot;. This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 24/7 id =\r\nwith light Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; defining is not a jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; mukta (liberated) yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;state&quot; from somebody, no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identi=\r\nfication &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with light, most likely body should not exist, no? =\r\nNarasimha: Id with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; light forever with body dropping off is j=\r\nust mukti, not jivanmukti! &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jivanmukti is where body stays. I=\r\ns body really different from light? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, is there anythi=\r\nng other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; play of object=\r\ns but seeing all as light. Mukti &amp; rna are contradictory &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n concepts &amp; cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. =\r\nWords like &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; free, liberated &amp; jivanmukta r often misused.=\r\n Manish: Will explain a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: O=\r\nK. :-) But, as far as &quot;explaining&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is concerned, Vasishtha e=\r\nxplained as clearly &amp; elaborately as any &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; human being can=\r\n ever hope 2. Manish: The question to my mind is this: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; was R=\r\namakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (according to your &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) Narasimha: Vasishth=\r\na didnt &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; give a single definition. His entire discourse 2 Ram=\r\na is a definition &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of jeevanmukta!
