For those who don&#39;t have anything to\n&gt; chant, pl=\r\nease chant ram, waheguru, allah or any name, mentally. Recite\n&gt; any mantra,=\r\n anything, every waking moment should be devoted to god,\n&gt; because its the =\r\nonly worthwhile thing to do as a human.\n&gt; Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo\n\n\nThan=\r\nks for the advice to chant till the cremation ground. Sound advice no doubt=\r\n.\n\nUnfortunately Durga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not=\r\n all of us are blessed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. =\r\nStop rubbing it in please. \n\nWhat is the use of asking us to chant more? As=\r\nk her to give us this desire, as she seems to have done for you. \n\nWhich br=\r\nings me to ranting a bit about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga.=\r\n The Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse =\r\nthan the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is being mur=\r\ndered in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes=\r\n it is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in=\r\n the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;=\r\nm furious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, wo=\r\nmen were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Godd=\r\ness). Why aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saint=\r\ns is probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of cov=\r\nering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then =\r\nyelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If sh=\r\ne wants to save us, she will have to create in us the desire to do japa or =\r\nwhatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.\n\nSo don&#39;t tell us to chant, t=\r\nell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n\nOk =\r\nrant over. I&#39;m going to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya re=\r\npetition now. Who knows when it&#39;s time for the cremation ground? You did it=\r\n for a select few, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n\nA=\r\nparna\n\n\n\n\n"}}
