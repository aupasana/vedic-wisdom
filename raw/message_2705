Now, the s=\r\npiritual law of duality is very well described by the two birds analogy, as=\r\n well as the 3 gunas are very well mentioned in the upanishads. Isn&#39;t it ?\n=\r\n\n&gt; From visuddhi chakra to moolaadhaara chakra lie the elements of\n&gt; ether,=\r\n air, fire, water and earth as I mentioned. I only focused on &gt; the last fi=\r\nve stages.\n\nWhat do you mean by last 5 stages ? Where is the beginning and =\r\nthe end of the sushumna passing through 6 cerebro-spinal chakras ?\n\nIn the =\r\nphysical body, it appears as a linear movement from the lowest mooladhara t=\r\no the highest ajna chakra - but the nadis&#39; emanating from these &quot;Shad-chakr=\r\nas&quot; - meet in a circular manner inside the Sahasrara Chakra (See the diagra=\r\nm of Astral Nadis&#39; prepared by YogiRaj ShyamaCharan Lahiri, published in Gi=\r\nta Commentary by Yogananda).\n\nThus, the highest Ajna is connected to the lo=\r\nwest Mooladhara and the awakening of one of them affects the other, a fact =\r\nrather well-documented in Yoga books. A fact, required to understand why Ga=\r\nnesh, deity of Mooladhara, is worshipped first.\n\n&gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies=\r\n undifferentiated consciousness (Brahman or &gt;Aatman), where there are no I-=\r\nness or any objectification. Just &gt;below it, there are several lokas that p=\r\neople do not mention\n&gt; normally.\n\nWith every invocation of Gayatri Mantra, =\r\nwe mention 3 or 7 of these lokas. Don&#39;t we do it &quot;Normally&quot; ?\n\nIn any case,=\r\n we are not discussing about the actual experiences or undifferentiated con=\r\nsciousness, the 6 tattwas that cause creation are still very much different=\r\niated in Nature.\n\nPatanjalis&#39; Chitta Vrittis&#39; correspond to the 5 tattwas a=\r\nnd are all happening on the background of Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tat=\r\ntwa.

If you could calm all those=\r\n modifications of Chitta, you would have your self-realized.\n\n&gt; In Aajnaa c=\r\nhakra lies the primordial state of the universe where\n&gt; there is just space=\r\n and time, but no five elements.\n\nNothing comes out from nothing. How can t=\r\nhe lower tattwas evolve from higher tattwas, if even their subtle represent=\r\nations are purged from existence altogether ?\n\nGreatest of the Seers have a=\r\nlready put down the scriptures in writing, so that people like us can benef=\r\nit.\n\nRegards,\nNitish\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao=\r\n &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am only addressing the five elements=\r\n mentioned in upanishads.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated c=\r\nonsciousness (Brahman or Aatman), where there are no I-ness or any objectif=\r\nication.

It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional vie=\r\nw that I am familiar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of crea=\r\ntion, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creati=\r\non, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with ch=\r\nakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddh=\r\ni chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth=\r\n. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrender=\r\ned, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. W=\r\nhen Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within one is surrender=\r\ned, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. A=\r\nnd so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physica=\r\nl earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existe=\r\nnce. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of existence. For examp=\r\nle, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse=\r\n, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An idea =\r\nthat one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some know=\r\nledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, different mental concep=\r\nts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one thi=\r\nnks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particul=\r\nar way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as =\r\nsomeone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. A=\r\nll those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and K=\r\nundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaar=\r\na chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative i=\r\ndea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaan=\r\na chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s c=\r\numulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\nany people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are of=\r\nten talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (wh=\r\nich may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini ac=\r\ntually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not p=\r\nerceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similar=\r\nly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cum=\r\nulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of =\r\nexistence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion =\r\nof self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards =\r\nsamadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes do=\r\nwn, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire=\r\n, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regardin=\r\ng physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe re=\r\nality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross p=\r\nhysical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can=\r\n &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mi=\r\nnd may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another=\r\n example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;se=\r\ne&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived =\r\nby the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can be percei=\r\nved by the external senses, because different people can experience the sam=\r\ne reality using their senses individually and verify the observation. Howev=\r\ner, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are som=\r\netimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberatin=\r\ng influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback =\r\nof modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One may =\r\ncategorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or halluci=\r\nnations, because there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy=\r\n of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the=\r\n following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences o=\r\nf mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom/message/951\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a spe=\r\ncific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seem=\r\ned to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experi=\r\nence, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person,=\r\n though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; R=\r\ne: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mess=\r\nage/391\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a specific =\r\nyogic experience that was described in detail and another person seemed to =\r\nknow about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating to the exp=\r\nerience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first pers=\r\non, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one p=\r\nerson had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another person =\r\nperceived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity, thoug=\r\nh others in the room could not perceive anything with their external senses=\r\n, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first =\r\nperson through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *so=\r\nme* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses=\r\n are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then=\r\n, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be =\r\nmeasured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; =\r\nthat mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied and measured is the=\r\n reality involving the gross body and its senses, one may suggest that expe=\r\nriences of the subtle body may be studied by observing various parts of the=\r\n gross physical body. For example, one can look at the nervous signals flow=\r\ning through various parts of the brain and try to correlate them with the e=\r\nxperiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like=\r\n a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redunda=\r\nnt. Though there is some correspondence between what happens in the causal,=\r\n subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one=\r\n mapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be re=\r\ndundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled using just the gross body=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses =\r\nfrom the road, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular h=\r\nouse with a lot of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be hav=\r\ning a party. People in one particular house with no lights are probably out=\r\n of town. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many=\r\n people are inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at t=\r\nhe house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous s=\r\nignals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic th=\r\nings, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reac=\r\nh and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science can=\r\nnot study that part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external se=\r\nnses, unless scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal wo=\r\nrld.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the interna=\r\nl world (which is the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe a=\r\nny space-time point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their =\r\nstate completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may exp=\r\nerience some part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly w=\r\nhere Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one obse=\r\nrves. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagann=\r\nath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- raja=\r\nrshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off i=\r\nncomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mentio=\r\nn some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yo=\r\ngi of the highest order) - it maybe of some help to you.

Thus, in=\r\n this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous=\r\n and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in=\r\n 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson=\r\n in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it..

There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by mult=\r\niple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many which=\r\n &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a =\r\ncorrelation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble op=\r\ninion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between basi=\r\nc Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation), non-locality=\r\n etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of pan=\r\nch-mahabhuta?!..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasi=\r\nmha, I would like to know more about how exactly you can link these two, be=\r\ncause I myself with my limited understand fail to see any viable correlatio=\r\nn at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent =\r\nstage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about is the basic =\r\nnature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it pr=\r\novide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathematics provides a t=\r\nool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhich is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted that everyone knows that =\r\nQuatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of ever=\r\nything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing  more=\r\n left to do. Physics is still quite far away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedi=\r\ncastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get the thrust of your point. Yes, sadhana is=\r\n the only way to know this for sure. And so also for everything else that i=\r\ns below the reach of the senses (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do=\r\n read about them (all these things e.g Atma etc), and about the significanc=\r\ne of the vedic gods anyway, dont we? They do offer a mild complement to sad=\r\nhana, dont they? They do help make the mind more receptive toward the benef=\r\nits of sadhana..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also wanted to assure you that I really w=\r\nant to know the answer to the question. I am not interested in a he-said/sh=\r\ne- said type game (if perhaps that is what you were hinting at?). I am extr=\r\nemely curious as to why there is an order and not a parallelism, for e.g. w=\r\nhy are the mahabhutas not simultaneously formed. There is some lesson in th=\r\nere (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some c=\r\norrelation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theo=\r\nry too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how does =\r\nit matter? Can anyone here really know for sure which came after which? We =\r\ncan only speculate and guess and retrofit logic and quote one scripture vs =\r\nanother scripture. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only practical way to really find =\r\nout the truth is sadhana.
