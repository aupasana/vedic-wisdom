Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychologi=\r\ncal constructs are created by religions to protect an average person from t=\r\nhe real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if an=\r\nd when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average lif=\r\ne and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will br=\r\niefly narrate a true and interesting incident. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An individual=\r\n - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitti=\r\nng at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged lo=\r\noking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The=\r\n sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bri=\r\nng some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man =\r\nand said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry=\r\n, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God =\r\nanyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectu=\r\nres as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably sile=\r\nnt hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his m=\r\nouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After h=\r\ne went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, =\r\n&quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,\n&gt; &gt;  but he has prob=\r\nably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was=\r\n sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and=\r\n went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looki=\r\nng man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I wa=\r\ns waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did no=\r\nt expect the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how the m=\r\nan got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu -=\r\n saffron clothes). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar=\r\n. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home lon=\r\ng back and have been a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did yo=\r\nu derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this=\r\n is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No on=\r\ne has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. =\r\nAnd God is the reason for all the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X=\r\n felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religio=\r\nn/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you have=\r\nn&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replie=\r\nd, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, res=\r\nt are all as confused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusio=\r\nn. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyenga=\r\nr continued, &quot;The root of\n&gt; &gt;  all this problem is this God business. Know =\r\nit for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond t=\r\nhe capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagi=\r\nne a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the individua=\r\nl keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a projection of =\r\nhis own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities from this form=\r\n, and generally be regarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond th=\r\nis. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying to understand the i=\r\nnfinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one has understood corre=\r\nctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought som=\r\ne ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a=\r\n kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. The=\r\nn he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your=\r\n head, don&#39;t get\n&gt; &gt;  confused by all these show of spirituality you see in=\r\n holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the =\r\nimpetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chen=\r\nnai where I grew up. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left h=\r\nome. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and =\r\nhow to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied hous=\r\ne, and a man, woman and a young girl came out of the house. They invited hi=\r\nm inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people=\r\n love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will sh=\r\now you something interesting if you join me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After an hour in=\r\nside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bring=\r\ning different fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl was mas=\r\nsaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality.=\r\n X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no q=\r\nualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjo=\r\nying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the=\r\n man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded hands were b=\r\nowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting o=\r\nn the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to se=\r\ne what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead o=\r\nf the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a =\r\nyoung man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingl=\r\ny fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the\n&gt; &gt;  whole room. H=\r\ne had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingl=\r\ny beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god sitting in=\r\n place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iy=\r\nengar.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; X did not know what was happening. He saw the young ma=\r\nn gestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnot=\r\nized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X=\r\n lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a=\r\n remote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearb=\r\ny, held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a d=\r\nhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with =\r\nash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that medi=\r\ntating man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was =\r\ntalking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in=\r\n Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing=\r\n directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again=\r\n and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed i=\r\nnto\n&gt; &gt;  unconsciousness again. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When X woke up, he was in th=\r\ne room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his ol=\r\nd, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to t=\r\nhe temple as directed. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt; param b=\r\nhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________=\r\n______________\n&gt; &gt;  From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any rel=\r\nigion\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Dear Prasanth,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To those who say=\r\n that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In=\r\n general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more=\r\n honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in God look a=\r\nt him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions =\r\nare most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply se=\r\nrved to formalize these biases.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While being mired in this word of =\r\nduality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weig=\r\nht of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on=\r\n our God. No wonder that others look at all the suffering in the world and =\r\nlaugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nWe all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of as=\r\nking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, w=\r\ne ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God belie=\r\nvers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one=\r\n or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful=\r\n. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. =\r\nWe &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the most part, our bhakti =\r\nis weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particul=\r\narly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pu=\r\nrsuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God=\r\n to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. =\r\nAn impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God bel=\r\nievers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The best way to bring about new waves of =\r\nbhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All w=\r\ne have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with our=\r\nselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf we see God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. =\r\nIt is difficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itsel=\r\nf as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our =\r\nfeet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions =\r\nask us to accept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on t=\r\nhem with reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going =\r\nany farther.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sasneham,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
