They can be done quickly in a\nfew =\r\nminutes if needed.\n\nA simple but effective Ganapathi homam can be performed=\r\n in 15 minutes\n(starting from achamana). If need be, it can certainly be re=\r\nduced even\nmore. If it is taking longer, then it just needs some more pract=\r\nice\nuntil the procedure / mantras become natural.\n\n\n&gt; This should take all =\r\nof 20 seconds to finish the main agnihotra.\n&gt; Much more time it would take =\r\nto set up, shower before etc.\n\n\nIMO, anyone doing meaningful sadhana should=\r\n be spending more time\ndoing the sadhana than in the setup portion. Otherwi=\r\nse, something\nshould probably change.\n\nIf someone simply sits down, offers =\r\nthree ahutis, and then moves on\n... this sadhana probably has no impact wha=\r\ntsoever. If someone can\nspend 20 seconds in homam, they can certainly do a =\r\n10 minute homam as\nwell ... can anyone honestly say otherwise? And a 10-15 =\r\nminute homam\nwill be 100 or 1000 times more effective than a 20 second homa=\r\nm.\n\nIMO, a 10-15 minute homam is the bare minimum. Why not do a longer 50\nm=\r\ninute Ganapati homam on weekends, and a shorter 10-15 minute Ganapati\nhomam=\r\n on weekdays?\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 7, 2012 at 6:23 AM, Ranga=\r\n Nambakam\n&lt;ranga_nambakam2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear learned members\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI have been doing Ganapathi homam once a week.
