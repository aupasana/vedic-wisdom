Does such a non-realiz=\r\ned being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? Never! &quot;\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Mugging up of veda=\r\ns&quot; - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an engineering text book for t=\r\nhe exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of mantra ch=\r\nanting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma like sandhya vandana=\r\nm, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and eveni=\r\nng by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana =\r\ncontinues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter =\r\nfor the rest of the life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers k=\r\neep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has=\r\n transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. Thi=\r\ns is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.\n=C2=A0\nFor this transf=\r\normed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand wha=\r\nt is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.\n=C2=A0\nFor i=\r\nnformation, Sayana&#39;s commentaries are based on the nirukta (meaning of vedi=\r\nc terms) of Yaska. Nirukta is one of the vedangas.

It is called panihomam. Even t=\r\nhe fire is not present there.

It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand of=\r\n the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here. I=\r\nt is as per sastra.

Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fire&quot; in his righ=\r\nt hand? Never! \n=C2=A0\nA real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has realized the Aatman=\r\n, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;may have&quot; spiri=\r\ntual abilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespective of whether =\r\nhe is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a blind traditi=\r\non without having experienced anything and thus violating the essence of th=\r\ne Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual conse=\r\nquence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at all they can be=\r\n called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell w=\r\nhich is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. \n=C2=A0\nTherefore,=\r\n for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare palms or a glo=\r\nved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Both, are in clea=\r\nr violation of the Vedic essence.\n=C2=A0\nHomam is a ritualistic form of wor=\r\nship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=C2=A0\nThis is=\r\n definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yag=\r\nyas and homas.

As long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I belie=\r\nve in Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing that =\r\nI am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won&#39;t make me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shal=\r\nl remain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experiences t=\r\nhe state of non-duality, theoritical talk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delu=\r\nsion. \n=C2=A0\nAdwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and seri=\r\nous sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized being=\r\ns - and had experienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such l=\r\nong penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIt is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elabora=\r\nte or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether i=\r\nt is correct and based on what vedic authority.\n=C2=A0\nThe question is not =\r\nabout being based on &quot;which vedic authority&quot; BUT, is the sadhana bearing fr=\r\nuits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic &#39;autho=\r\nrity&#39; says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge=\r\n and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way t=\r\no judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is w=\r\nhy there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some=\r\n have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely ri=\r\nvets one&#39;s mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and de=\r\neper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experie=\r\nnced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not ju=\r\nst the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. =\r\n\n=C2=A0\n\n2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAre there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depe=\r\nnding on what he knows and what he does ?\n=C2=A0\nThe flying of the aeroplan=\r\ne is the same.

An=\r\nd all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the Ved=\r\nas itself?

I am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nand now you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some spec=\r\nific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with=\r\n all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed =\r\nhis understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulatio=\r\nn for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation=\r\n and started to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slow=\r\nly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara know=\r\nledge&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nYes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, whi=\r\nch is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His theories=\r\n are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always=\r\n maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is convenient =\r\nto give the impression that there is more. If anything does not make sense,=\r\n it could be because you have to learn more!\n=C2=A0\nAs he started exploitin=\r\ng and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the name of=\r\n a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dishonesty. =\r\nAfter expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I started =\r\nto go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes, I was =\r\nkicked out of SJC.\n=C2=A0\nWith basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, ch=\r\nara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect.=\r\n He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work=\r\n consistently.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some specific=\r\n secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imperfe=\r\nct too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily created a bo=\r\ndy of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teachings t=\r\nhat can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIn 2000 you said\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It=\r\n shows general\n\n\nresults. Narayana dasa is computed differently for differe=\r\nnt divisional charts and we \ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to=\r\n predict matters related to that \ndivisional chart. \n=C2=A0 \nNarayana dasa =\r\nis based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa end=\r\ns \nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and anothe=\r\nr rasi \nbecomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna.

It contains an analogy given=\r\n earlier and addresses some relevant issues.\n\n------------ --------- ------=\r\n--\nDo Vedas Describe External Rituals\n\nSome people believe that Veda descri=\r\nbes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be abs=\r\nolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paa=\r\ntra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-k=\r\naala-paatra?\n\nThough Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVed=\r\na is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=\r\n=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolu=\r\nte truths about the inner self and not relative truths about external matte=\r\nrs. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal=\r\n in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and purif=\r\ny all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offe=\r\nrings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the=\r\n smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n\nMetaphor: Vedic Homa=\r\nm vs Aagamic Homam\n\nNotions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Ve=\r\nda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can=\r\n be put in perspective using a metaphor.\n\nOnce there were many people who l=\r\nived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the s=\r\night and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They descr=\r\nibed the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\nAs people started living a=\r\n little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put to=\r\ngether some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking to=\r\nwards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed=\r\n the instructions [rituals].\n\nPeople started moving further and further inl=\r\nand and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This g=\r\neneration had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They=\r\n faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find =\r\nsea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles o=\r\nr three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their ch=\r\nosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object and ev=\r\nen became satisfied that that was sea!\n\nThen came some great person, whose =\r\ninstincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long=\r\n distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He =\r\nput together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a h=\r\norse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n\nPeople performing the old rituals object=\r\ned to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book o=\r\nf sea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure V=\r\nedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems=\r\n of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those po=\r\nems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were bli=\r\nssfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone alrea=\r\ndy close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually s=\r\naw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea fr=\r\nom there!\n\nSlowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots =\r\netc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just=\r\n instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantr=\r\nas].\n\nOne particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other d=\r\nark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the di=\r\nstance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangero=\r\nus and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoi=\r\nts and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak peop=\r\nle travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the ent=\r\nire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people=\r\n from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to s=\r\nuccessfully make it in that path desisted from it.\n\nAs time progressed, peo=\r\nple started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were fool=\r\nish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-=\r\ncalled &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for=\r\n the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions bl=\r\nindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;r=\r\neaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thoug=\r\nht they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was n=\r\no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even c=\r\nondemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directi=\r\nons for their place and time, for violating tradition.\n\nIn case the analogy=\r\n is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizi=\r\nng self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspa=\r\nti etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various asp=\r\nects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the hig=\r\nhest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to =\r\nreach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be made on t=\r\nhe actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be=\r\n made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based on des=\r\na-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n\nGreat men in m=\r\nany spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experi=\r\nenced that state, understood the current state of people around them and ga=\r\nve specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current state.=\r\n Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kep=\r\nt arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n\nStop Arguing and Do Sadh=\r\nana\n\nAs the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are i=\r\nrrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow i=\r\nt. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue.=\r\n The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, =\r\nhow one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transformed inter=\r\nnally.\n\nJust as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not g=\r\nive much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual don=\r\ne once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or=\r\n material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten ever=\r\nyday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday giv=\r\nes a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n\nWise Tradeoffs\n\nSuppose t=\r\nhe president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. =\r\nOne can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat the=\r\nm in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one can excha=\r\nnge long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n\nSuppose one=\r\n is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 a=\r\nssociates by name and seats them in the room individually following the pro=\r\ntocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the e=\r\nnd, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates =\r\ntogether and seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time=\r\n to let the President eat in peace?\n\nSimilarly, is it wise if one exchanges=\r\n long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut sho=\r\nrt on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?\n\nIn a fire ritual, making=\r\n offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to=\r\n the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary =\r\nand final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has=\r\n a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures=\r\n leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs=\r\n and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n\n&lt;sections =\r\ndeleted&gt;\n\nProof of the Pudding\n\nAt this time, more than hundred people are =\r\ndoing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshippi=\r\nng god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surren=\r\nder and with some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths e=\r\nxpounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s sp=\r\niritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to=\r\n perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if the=\r\nre is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking=\r\n.\n------------ --------- --------\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sh=\r\nort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -\n\n---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dea=\r\nr Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me=\r\n into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward =\r\nfrom Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora i=\r\ns not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone through=\r\n the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam bein=\r\ng performed and have the following observations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per rul=\r\nes laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for =\r\nvarious rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoorna=\r\nmasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in darsapoorn=\r\namasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or ama=\r\nntraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are esse=\r\nntial and which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later el=\r\naborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in the dif=\r\nferent sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc=\r\n., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grai=\r\nns, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised us=\r\ning the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise=\r\n it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous wo=\r\nrk &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these step=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sut=\r\nras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic=\r\n and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorun=\r\nd the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding da=\r\nrbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The direct=\r\nion for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita =\r\nprasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not b=\r\ne because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE =\r\ncorner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasadanam o=\r\nr keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensi=\r\nls is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojana=\r\nm and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12. B=\r\nrahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya samska=\r\nram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used=\r\n for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles =\r\nused in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou) =\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16. Idhma=\r\n pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in th=\r\ne ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee=\r\n to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; \n&gt; and =\r\nmany more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure t=\r\nhe deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he ac=\r\nts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of d=\r\neity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular=\r\n deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary=\r\n)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda an=\r\nd the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is=\r\n converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devat=\r\na aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available =\r\nin the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhaka=\r\ns. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to ge=\r\nt the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for man=\r\ntra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to =\r\nperfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 min=\r\nute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learn=\r\ning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own pu=\r\nrity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to prese=\r\nrve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-636908267-1277042133=:33887\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Shri.Rajarshi,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1.&quot;Thank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very =\r\npertinent question regarding this.&nbsp; And what exactly does it mean by s=\r\naying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who&nbsp;has mugged up the Vedas a=\r\nnd a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-re=\r\nalization, be called a &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fir=\r\ne&quot; in his right hand? Never! &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Mugging up of =\r\nvedas&quot; - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an engineering text book f=\r\nor the exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours&nbsp;aday of mantr=\r\na chanting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma like sandhya van=\r\ndanam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and e=\r\nvening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadh=\r\nana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereaf=\r\nter for the rest of the life time. I have come across a scholar whose finge=\r\nrs keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He=\r\n has transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him.=\r\n This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For this transformed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He=\r\n knows even beforehand what is there in the bhashya and what it means in va=\r\nrious planes.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For information, Sayana&#39;s commen=\r\ntaries are based on the nirukta (meaning of vedic terms) of Yaska. Nirukta =\r\nis one of the vedangas. If we call Sayana&#39;s commentary a distortion, we wil=\r\nl have to disown Yaska as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. &quot;Vasistha s=\r\npoke the Yoga Vasistham&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Who is the real autho=\r\nr of yoga vasishtam Vasishta or Valmiki ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;3. &quot;=\r\nThe vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By exten=\r\nsion of your above logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita since th=\r\ney used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;Advaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas =\r\n(or ways of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have differe=\r\nnt views. By Vedic rishis do you mean the&nbsp;rishis who composed the veda=\r\n mantras or the later ones also&nbsp;who philosphized on them. The views ar=\r\ne not homogenous. The advaita vada is the most propagated one among the gen=\r\neral public and has great appeal . The other views also appear to be equall=\r\ny valid if you read them. There were rishis who subscribed to the advaita v=\r\nada, and others who did not.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yajno hi m=\r\nantaeirdevatamuddisya dravyasya daanam - Yajna is providing dravya to the d=\r\nevata with the mantra. This is another view.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;4=\r\n. &quot;Can you kindly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status&quot;.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No surpirse, That is the essence of veda. Not o=\r\nnly usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, sinivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut,eart=\r\nh, fire, storm, water, medha (intellect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis, nak=\r\nshatras, all are accorded elevated status. That&#39;s how veda is.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;5. &quot;The way one can learn is different based on the differ=\r\nent models of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If one has flying experience on a cessana alone he will not be =\r\nallowed to fly a boeing. This is why I said I am only against mixing up.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;6. &quot;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39; t=\r\nhese artifically created boundaried and achived and experienced higher stat=\r\nes.

In my little&nbsp;understanding, it is the&nbsp;goal which =\r\nis&nbsp;God-realization, which is the&nbsp;only&nbsp;&quot;fundamental principle=\r\n&quot;. Anything else is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas, as all se=\r\nlf-realized saints have told us, are about eternal truths, nothing short. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It will be interesting here to point out t=\r\nhat when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham&nbsp;do the&=\r\nnbsp;hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Even=\r\n the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahmanasy=\r\na dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right hand =\r\nof the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand =\r\nof the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here.=\r\n It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perfr=\r\nomed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for the interesting example a=\r\nbove. But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.&nbsp; And what e=\r\nxactly does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who&nbsp;h=\r\nas mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experien=\r\ncing any sort of self-realization, be called a &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-=\r\nrealized being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? Never! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has &lt;EM&gt;realized &lt;/EM&gt;the Aatman, not =\r\nin words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;may have&quot; spiritual a=\r\nbilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is&=\r\nnbsp;born in&nbsp;brhamin family, is merely following a blind tradition wit=\r\nhout having experienced anything and thus violating the essence of the Veda=\r\ns and merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual consequence=\r\n. What use is such&nbsp;a&nbsp;&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at all they can be calle=\r\nd as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell which i=\r\ns bound to reform or perish in the course of time. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bar=\r\ne palms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. B=\r\noth, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita =\r\nvada in it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This=\r\n is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate =\r\nyagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not b=\r\nelieve in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?=\r\n&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, whi=\r\nch is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different ya=\r\ngyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.&nbsp; Does it mean they did not &quot;bel=\r\nieve&quot; in advaita? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Your above statement stems =\r\nfrom an incorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is=\r\n trapped in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not=\r\n make one become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that&nb=\r\nsp;won&#39;t make me Bill Gates. Rather&nbsp;I shall remain merely as a self de=\r\nluded entity. Untill one actually experiences the state of non-duality, the=\r\noritical talk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delusion. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and serious sa=\r\ndhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized beings - an=\r\nd had experienced the state of&nbsp;Advaitha - used to perform such long pe=\r\nnances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It is not a question of whethe=\r\nr it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is s=\r\nuperior. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic =\r\nauthority.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The question is not a=\r\nbout being based on &quot;which vedic authority&quot; BUT, is the sadhana bearing fru=\r\nits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic &#39;author=\r\nity&#39; says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge =\r\nand states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to=\r\n judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is wh=\r\ny there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some =\r\nhave experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely riv=\r\nets one&#39;s mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and dee=\r\nper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experien=\r\nced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not jus=\r\nt the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2. &quot;What I teach is ONE pro=\r\ncedure for those who do not know any.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Are there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane =\r\ndepending on what he knows and what he does ?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The flying of the aeroplane is the same.

It evolves based on desa-k=\r\naala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but =\r\nif it starts evolving around paatra it is a dangerous trend.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Paatra is a product of the desa and kaala, not=\r\n uninfluenced by the other two. That is why these three are used in tandem.=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;4. &quot;The only knowledge=\r\n that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is=\r\n *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute=\r\n knowledge. Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be ab=\r\nsolute&quot;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sir, honestly, have=\r\n you ever read the vedas to know what is inside them ? or for that matter t=\r\nhe Sayana bhashya&lt;/EM&gt;. &lt;EM&gt;other than in the ritualistic context. I am quo=\r\nting the above mantras because they are commonly known.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM=\r\n&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is the precisely th=\r\ne reason why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly stated that the available inte=\r\nrpretations of the Vedas do not do justice to it&#39;s essence. Selective words=\r\n from here and there really do not prove that the Vedas are merely a set of=\r\n rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a fallacy where-in one cel=\r\nebrated western commentator on the Vedas believes that the Purusha shukta i=\r\nn an example of human-scarfice practised in the Vedas. I am sure you will d=\r\nisagree with this. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Can you kindly enlighten u=\r\ns, why is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. What is =\r\nso big deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to address hym=\r\nns to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the Rig V=\r\nedas, which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature worsh=\r\nipping pagan&#39;s attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by by wo=\r\nrd translations or a core ritualistic view&nbsp;is all there is to the Veda=\r\ns, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure bet=\r\nween the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic peri=\r\nod? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from t=\r\nhe Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts =\r\nbe bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of&nbsp;=\r\n the Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and t=\r\nheir later day derivatives?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Any path, vedic, agamic, yogic, tantrik, aghori,&nbsp;if=\r\n rightly followed exclusively and fully can lead to the desired objective&n=\r\nbsp;. But mixing up of paths could be disastrous.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39; these artifically=\r\n created boundaried and achived and experienced higher states.

I am eternally=\r\n grateful to him&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;and now you say&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific s=\r\necrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all o=\r\nther paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his un=\r\nderstanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for =\r\nthe &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and s=\r\ntarted to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he =\r\nbecame commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philo=\r\nsophization, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scruti=\r\nny. His theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. =\r\nSanjay ji always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. I=\r\nt is convenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does=\r\n not make sense, it could be because you have to learn more!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and =\r\nill-conceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to =\r\nthe commercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations priv=\r\nately and having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later =\r\nbluntly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, ar=\r\ngalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates fr=\r\nom Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work consistently.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some s=\r\npecific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are =\r\nimperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily creat=\r\ned a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teac=\r\nhings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In 2000 you said&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTimes-R=\r\noman&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa.

Narayana dasa is computed differently for d=\r\nifferent divisional charts and we \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;can use Narayana dasa of=\r\n a divisional chart to predict matters related to that \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;div=\r\nisional chart. \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;Narayana dasa is ba=\r\nsed on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life.

There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolvin=\r\ng around paatra it is a dangerous trend.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A car=\r\n still runs on four wheels.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;4. &quot;The only knowl=\r\nedge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge tha=\r\nt is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is abso=\r\nlute knowledge. Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never b=\r\ne absolute&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sir, honestly, have you ever read=\r\n the vedas to know what is inside them ? or for that matter the Sayana bhas=\r\nhya.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Can you come up with any valid alternate =\r\nmeaning for the word &quot;yajamahey&quot; in the mrutyunjaya mantra&nbsp; OR&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Saptaasyaasan paridhayaha ............ ... in the pur=\r\nusha suktam&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yajnena yajnammayajanta ..........=\r\n.. ......in the purshasuktam&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;deva yadyajnam ta=\r\nnvana ............ ......... in the purusha suktam&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;The anuvaka Idhmascha me ............ .... in chamakam&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;other than in the ritualistic context. I am quoting the above=\r\n mantras because they are commonly known.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sir,=\r\n there is book in devanagari of the krishna yajurveda (complete moolam) ava=\r\nilable with chowkhamba,varanasi which clearly mentioins the viniyoga of eac=\r\nh mantra.

There are many st=\r\nandard homam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what w=\r\ne teach and some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses =\r\nand I will be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespect=\r\nive of the exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those wh=\r\no do not know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you=\r\n can do daily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That wi=\r\nll make us very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily=\r\n, please consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one should serve=\r\n lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup =\r\nbowls, drink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve var=\r\nious items in those contai\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
