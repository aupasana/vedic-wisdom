I wanted to share a\nsuggestion that works along with any of these.\n\nIn all vaidika karmas, there is a procedure called &quot;pratisara-bandha&quot;. This\nis a raksha bandhana where a cotton thread (optimally made of 9 strands) is\nenergized with mantras and then worn around the wrist so that a little of\nthe mantra shakti stays with you. A kalasha is established, with some\nvibhuti and a cotton thread placed to it&#39;s north. Then, Varuna is invoked\nin the kalasha, and then a number of vedic mantras are recited. At the end,\nwe pray to Varuna once again, and then sprinkle the water from the kalasha\non the yajamana and the cotton thread. The cotton thread is then worn on\nthe wrist (right hand for men, left hand for women) as an amulet, and the\nvibhuti is worn on the forehead.\n\nThe vaidika procedure specifies particular sets of mantras. In the\nbodhayana tradition, this starts with the rAkshoghnam (something to destroy\nrAkshasas). However, you may use some other mantra in it&#39;s place. If you\nare using the hanuman chalisa, as Narasimha suggested, you can chant that\nmantra a number of times, and then wear the thread and vibhuti. Or, you\ncould follow the Satayanarayana puja manual with the cotton thread and\nvibhuti near by, and then sprinkle the thread with water and then wear it\nand the vibhuti. You could even put a pot of water, think of Varuna, then\ndo a bunch of bhajans, and then wear the thread and sprinkle the water on\nthe area where you will be sleeping. The principle is the same.\n\nThe procedure for &quot;pratisarabandha&quot; specifically mentions disturbed sleep\nas an application.\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\n\nOn Mon, Aug 5, 2013 at 8:20 AM, ilya.suzdalnitski &lt;\nilya.suzdalnitski@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently I was staying at an old house in a village.
