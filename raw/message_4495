Or is it one designe=\r\nd by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There are=\r\n many procedures even within the vedic system for performing homam. Each es=\r\ntablished procedure given by acharyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and =\r\ndo not violate the fundamental principles of vedic rituals.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It w=\r\nill be interesting here to point out that when some sections of samavedis w=\r\nhen they perform sraadham=C2=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta=\r\n brahmin. It is called panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is=\r\n based on a dictum called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa=\r\n is to be performed on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that a=\r\ngni is ever present in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the v=\r\neda) brahmin. There is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modi=\r\nfy this and say that homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a bra=\r\nhmin, then the problem arises.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As you have said, any system of w=\r\norship is acceptable. There are so many religions and cults all around the =\r\nworld. Nobody objects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that i=\r\nt conforms to the vedic tenets.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Homam is a ritualistic form of w=\r\norship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I=\r\nt is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or wh=\r\nich is inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether it is cor=\r\nrect and based on what vedic authority. If you are promoting this homa proc=\r\nedure as one of your own design, there is no objection. On the contrary, if=\r\n you need the sanction of vedic authority for it, please=C2=A0answer within=\r\n the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts are raised.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The app=\r\nrehension is that in the year 2000 you said,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;I cannot possibly =\r\nfinish this preface without expressing my deep gratitude for my \n&gt; guru Pt.=\r\n Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of enlightenment, \n&gt; encourage=\r\nment and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; and now yo=\r\nu say\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific s=\r\necrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all o=\r\nther paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his un=\r\nderstanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for =\r\nthe &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and s=\r\ntarted to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he =\r\nbecame commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, which=\r\n is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His theories a=\r\nre like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always m=\r\naintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is convenient to=\r\n give the impression that there is more. If anything does not make sense, i=\r\nt could be because you have to learn more!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As he started exploit=\r\ning and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the name =\r\nof a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dishonesty=\r\n. After expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I starte=\r\nd to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes, I wa=\r\ns kicked out of SJC.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; With basic concepts like houses, arudha pad=\r\nas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are impe=\r\nrfect. He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do no=\r\nt work consistently.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of som=\r\ne specific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that a=\r\nre imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily cr=\r\neated a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his t=\r\neachings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In 200=\r\n0 you said\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It i=\r\ns a phalita dasa. It shows general\n&gt; results. Narayana dasa is computed dif=\r\nferently for different divisional charts and we\n&gt; can use Narayana dasa of =\r\na divisional chart to predict matters related to that\n&gt; divisional chart.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; Narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=\r\n=99s life. As one dasa ends\n&gt; and another starts, one rasi stops being the =\r\nprogressed lagna and another rasi\n&gt; becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna.=\r\n Using the progressed lagna as the reference, we\n&gt; find out the events that=\r\n happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each\n&gt; person, with eac=\r\nh chart applicable in one dasa.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This is a very versatile dasa sy=\r\nstem and readers sould pay attention to the details of\n&gt; calculation.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; now you say\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;Narayana dasa may be based on some genuine=\r\n parampara knowledge, but it does not work with any level of consistency. I=\r\n am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You seem to start teaching even=\r\n before you=C2=A0start learning.=C2=A0I&#39; m only afraid it should not happen=\r\n in the context of vedic rituals also.

There are many standard homam procedures in =\r\nthe world today, some more elaborate than what we teach and some more brief=\r\n. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be happy if more=\r\n and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of the exact procedure =\r\nused! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any. If you a=\r\nre initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily, please go ah=\r\nead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make us very happy. Howe=\r\nver, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please consider what I ta=\r\nught, which is simple enough to do daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose there are=\r\n rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch to one&#39;s parents, e.g. h=\r\now to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, drink cups, dessert bowl=\r\ns etc and how and in what order to serve various items in those containers.=\r\n Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyday and call=\r\ns one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few months.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that better or i=\r\ns it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal and ser=\r\nve lunch to parents everyday?\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest that we prese=\r\nrve each branch of knowledge in its own purity.\n&gt; &gt; Hybrids may not always =\r\nyield good results.

It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra=\r\n. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the day, =\r\nthe key is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or=\r\n not, whether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whet=\r\nher it helps in one&#39;s spiritual progress or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me cut=\r\n & paste a section from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It cont=\r\nains an analogy given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; Do Vedas Describe External Rituals\n&gt; \n&gt; Some pe=\r\nople believe that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagya=\r\ns. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that i=\r\ns not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external=\r\n rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?\n&gt; \n&gt; Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99=\r\ns celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghos=\r\ne had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His vie=\r\nw is that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not rel=\r\native truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Wil=\r\nl. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everyt=\r\nhing that is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symboli=\r\nzes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions a=\r\nnd desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; Notions that s=\r\no and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric y=\r\nagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a met=\r\naphor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. Th=\r\ney regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [abs=\r\norbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cryp=\r\ntic poems [Veda].\n&gt; \n&gt; As people started living a little away from the sea =\r\n[less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions o=\r\nn how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instru=\r\nctions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals=\r\n].\n&gt; \n&gt; People started moving further and further inland and started living=\r\n in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never se=\r\nen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed =\r\nthe ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endl=\r\nessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and form=\r\ned different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a=\r\n tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfied th=\r\nat that was sea!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then came some great person, whose instincts led him =\r\nto take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of =\r\nother tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer=\r\n instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4ga=\r\nma and tantra].\n&gt; \n&gt; People performing the old rituals objected to this and=\r\n said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is=\r\n a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. =\r\nBy now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the origin=\r\nal &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught the=\r\n old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully unawar=\r\ne that the original instructions were meant for someone already close to se=\r\na and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and=\r\n knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were t=\r\naught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructi=\r\nng people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/yantras].\n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nne particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tan=\r\ntric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance =\r\nto sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and =\r\nonly the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and =\r\nwild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people trav=\r\nelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire ter=\r\nritory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from t=\r\nrying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successf=\r\nully make it in that path desisted from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As time progressed, people=\r\n started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish=\r\n, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-cal=\r\nled &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for th=\r\ne changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blind=\r\nly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reac=\r\nhing the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought =\r\nthey were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no n=\r\need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even cond=\r\nemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions=\r\n for their place and time, for violating tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; In case the analog=\r\ny is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realiz=\r\ning self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihasp=\r\nati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various as=\r\npects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the hi=\r\nghest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to=\r\n reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be made on =\r\nthe actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can b=\r\ne made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based on de=\r\nsa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n&gt; \n&gt; Great men=\r\n in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, e=\r\nxperienced that state, understood the current state of people around them a=\r\nnd gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current s=\r\ntate. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instea=\r\nd kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop Arguing an=\r\nd Do Sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; As the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about variou=\r\ns paths are irrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path=\r\n and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a sec=\r\nondary issue. The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how foc=\r\nused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being tran=\r\nsformed internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as a twenty course meal eaten once every six =\r\nmonths does not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or a=\r\nnother ritual done once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=\r\n=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lenti=\r\nl soup eaten everyday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam =\r\ndone everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wise=\r\n Tradeoffs\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose the president of the country is visiting one for lu=\r\nnch with 100 associates. One can invite all the 100 associates of the Presi=\r\ndent by name and seat them in the room individually, following various prot=\r\nocols. Then one can exchange long pleasantries with the President and then =\r\noffer lunch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose one is in a hurry and has very little time. If on=\r\ne still invites all the 100 associates by name and seats them in the room i=\r\nndividually following the protocol and does not have enough time to let the=\r\n President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to i=\r\nnvite all the 100 associates together and seat them together by violating t=\r\nhe protocol and use that time to let the President eat in peace?\n&gt; \n&gt; Simil=\r\narly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and gives very little t=\r\nime to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries and give more time =\r\nto eat?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a fire ritual, making offerings to the main deity is the pr=\r\nimary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before the offerings commen=\r\nce is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and offerings to assoc=\r\niate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one =\r\ncan do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minu=\r\ntes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far b=\r\netter than doing nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;sections deleted&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Proof of the Pudding=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; At this time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to some deit=\r\ny or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 m=\r\nin (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic in=\r\ntellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upani=\r\nshads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The pro=\r\nof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam eve=\r\nryday for a few months and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=\r\n=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking.\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jy=\r\notish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- mou=\r\nlamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At =\r\nthe outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I=\r\n had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwriting=\r\ns on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right for=\r\num for discussing these topics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have gone through the homam manu=\r\nal provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and=\r\n have the following observations to make.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. As per rules laid out=\r\n by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various rit=\r\nuals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which=\r\n is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa s=\r\nhould be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka =\r\nform, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential a=\r\nnd which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborate=\r\nd by acharyas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in the differ=\r\nent sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., =\r\nbut no omissions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, gra=\r\nins, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised u=\r\nsing the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwis=\r\ne it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous w=\r\nork &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these ste=\r\nps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of th=\r\ne sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of =\r\nvedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the dar=\r\nbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succ=\r\needing darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra =\r\n&quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. T=\r\nhis can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle star=\r\nting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above =\r\ndarbha is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purif=\r\nication of the utensils is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifyi=\r\nng the utensils is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahana=\r\nm on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with d=\r\narbha) is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma)=\r\n is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and pa=\r\nryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 14. Da=\r\nrvee samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Alwa=\r\nys to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 15. Placement of paridhi=\r\n and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a=\r\n fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 17. It is seen in=\r\n the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis=\r\n are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ah=\r\nuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and many more .........=\r\n...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not=\r\n invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier f=\r\nor the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced=\r\n in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at a=\r\nll deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 18. =\r\nIn the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni =\r\nacts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted =\r\ninto the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahu=\r\ntis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the =\r\nmantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They=\r\n don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the r=\r\night pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sad=\r\nhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom=\r\n homam for any devata.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute=\r\n Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning=\r\n from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own p=\r\nurity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to pres=\r\nerve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
