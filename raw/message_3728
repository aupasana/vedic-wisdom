Here G is her gotra, N is nakshatra, R is janma raashi, L is lagna =\r\nand X is the name.\n\n(3) Homam to Shiva using the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra is=\r\n ideal for this purpose, though you can really do any homam you want. One s=\r\npecific offering is mentioned. Make paayasam (cook rice in milk and ghee, i=\r\n.e. clarified butter, and add jaggery). Offer darbhas (sacred dry grass) di=\r\npped in paayasam with each repetition of the mantra, if possible.\n\n(4) The =\r\ninstinct to help someone else and reduce someone else&#39;s suffering is a very=\r\n noble and useful one.\n\nHowever, it is not without its costs. Basically rem=\r\nember that the world runs based on actions and reactions. Any suffering som=\r\neone is experiencing is a reaction to a previous action committed by that p=\r\nerson. If you want to take it on yourself, you will either have to experien=\r\nce the reaction or burn the karma (action) though sadhana, i.e. convert the=\r\n reaction into something else using some energy.\n\nOf course, taking on some=\r\none else&#39;s suffering and suffering oneself is not easy. So what you are rea=\r\nlly trying to do is to burn the karma using the energy created by a focused=\r\n sadhana such as homam or japam. This is akin to someone throwing a ball at=\r\n a wall and the ball coming at that person fast later and you trying to bur=\r\nn it on the way (using some energy such as heat).\n\nThe problem is that your=\r\n sadhana may not succeed in perfectly avoiding the reaction. In other words=\r\n, the ball that bounced back may not be reduced to ashes fully and some sma=\r\nll pieces of the ball may still come and hit that person (or you on his/her=\r\n behalf). Not being rishis, we cannot perfectly control the dynamics. Think=\r\n for a moment if you are fine with taking a bit of suffering if needed, as =\r\na result of avoiding a major catastrophe for that person.\n\n(5) Some learned=\r\n Adwaitis may correctly say, &quot;all is Brahman. Life and death is the same. A=\r\natman is neither born nor does it die. What is there to worry if someone is=\r\n suffering or close to death?&quot;\n\nHowever, that is a wrong approach. Both dua=\r\nlity and non-duality are valid and true. It is easy to sit on the bank and =\r\ntell someone drowning in the ocean, &quot;you are ocean are the same. Do not wor=\r\nry&quot;. If one is really at a stage where one can think like that even when on=\r\ne is drowning in ocean and not worry, THEN one is a true adwaita jnaani. Ot=\r\nherwise, it is just bookish knowledge and means nothing.\n\nBecause the world=\r\n has so many people stuck in the duality (good vs bad, happy vs sad, beauti=\r\nful vs ugly etc polarities), rishis have given knowledge that helps one swi=\r\nm the ocean of polarities and ultimately realize Self. Merely stating that =\r\nall is Brahman may not help anybody realize that. Until one realizes that, =\r\none needs tools to navigate the ocean of duality.\n\nLet me put it this way: =\r\nWhen YOU find yourself in various situations that cause pleasure and pain, =\r\ntry to think like an Adwaiti and remind yourself that all is Brahman. When =\r\nyou are dealing with someone else who is in great pain, forget adwaita and =\r\ntry to identify with that person and feel the person&#39;s pain. That will not =\r\ndo any harm to your spiritual progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Softwar=\r\ne, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -\n\n---- prm7782 &lt;prm7782@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; I recently fou=\r\nnd out that a small 5 year old girl(friend of my daughters) has been very s=\r\nick and is hospitalised.
