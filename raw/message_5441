If talking to the =\r\nperson has a chance of helping, one can try that. Sometimes, it may be coun=\r\nter-productive. If so, one can just wait till the person runs through that =\r\nphase. When (if) the phase is over and the person is ready to disentangle, =\r\none can help.\n \nOne of Rammakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s highly learned disciples,=\r\n Swami Abhedananda, was interested in Raja yoga and hot pursuit of Kundalin=\r\ni rise through physical activity such as breathing. He heard about a guru w=\r\nith some siddhis and went to him once, though Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had e=\r\nxplicitly told him to stay away from such people. The guru lived on a mount=\r\nain with disciples and disciples could not leave him once accepted into his=\r\n fold. Swami Abhedananda accepted the conditions, joined them, spent some t=\r\nime with them, realized his folly and the wisdom of Ramakrishna&#39;s words. He=\r\n decided to escape. He was found out and the other disciples of that guru k=\r\nept pelting stones at Swami Abhedananda as he was climbing down the hill. O=\r\nf course, he made it down, came back to Dakshineshwar and fell at Ramakrish=\r\nna&#39;s feet. When even Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could not stop a disciple from=\r\n having to go through an experience with a wrong guru, what can people like=\r\n us do? Karma is powerful and some rinas cannot be avoided. The only way to=\r\n avoid the results of certain karmas is to not perform them in the first pl=\r\nace!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make=\r\n a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n \n---- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Narasi=\r\nmha Garu, \n&gt; I agree with your point...&quot;I humbly suggest that our critical =\r\nabilities should not be wasted on people and things that we do not have a r=\r\nesponsibility to change&quot;\n&gt; but, what if one among the immediate family memb=\r\ners has a penchant towards one such not so genuinely looking guru&#39;s? can we=\r\n be really be having the attitude of &quot;Apne ko kya lena dena&quot; or can/should =\r\nwe be doing anything here?\n&gt; Apologies  for being a poke\n&gt; ThanksKK\n&gt;\n&gt; ---=\r\n On Sat, 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: One Sheir fo=\r\nr today&#39;s so called Dharma Gurus\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: &quot;=\r\naksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Saturday, December 11, 2010, 1=\r\n1:39 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; For those who don&#39;t know Hindi, this couplet can b=\r\ne loosely translated as: &quot;He looks in the mirror to check that he looks goo=\r\nd, but also ensures that nobody catches him looking at the mirror!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The=\r\nre may indeed be many gurus today who are image-conscious, hypocritical and=\r\n manipulative.
