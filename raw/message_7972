Is =\r\nit symbolic of anything at all? I have had multiple curious happenings invo=\r\nlving spiders - I have no particular love or fear of them.

And for the ones with a funny bone, n=\r\no I dont have a house full of cobwebs :-)\n\nIn the book &quot;Dreams, Symbols and=\r\n Homeopathy: Archetypal Dimensions of Healing&quot; by Jane Cicchetti, there is =\r\na sentence &quot;The ancient vedic philosophy of India suggests that a spider wo=\r\nve the veil of illusion that conceals the supreme reality&quot;. But there is no=\r\n reference to any vedic text.. I wonder if it is just hearsay..\n\nRegards,\n\n=\r\nSundeep\n\n\n"}}
