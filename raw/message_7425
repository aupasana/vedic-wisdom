At this stage you might add ground sa=\r\nffron, as well\n&gt;  - just be sure to let it soak, if you do.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are=\r\n using a small amount (1 tsp to 1 Tbsp), put into the microwave\n&gt; for appro=\r\nximately 15-30 seconds. You might check it every 10 seconds or so,\n&gt; depend=\r\ning on how much you&#39;ve made. If you are making more, you&#39;ll have to\n&gt; adjus=\r\nt the timing accordingly and stir every 10-15 seconds.\n&gt; \n&gt; When it&#39;s turne=\r\nd a brilliant red, you&#39;re done.

I&#39;m guessing that most peop=\r\nle either buy ghee, or melt it\n&gt; &gt; on a stove. There is another option that=\r\n I use -- a small crock pot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Materials:\n&gt; &gt; (a) Glass jar that will=\r\n fit a standard 16oz block of butter e.g.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Presso Storage Jars, 2.5 lit=\r\ners&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; (b) A small crock pot that will fit the glass jar e.g. &quot;Little Di=\r\npper\n&gt; &gt; Warmer Crock Pot&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; (c) butter e.g. individually wrapped 16 oz =\r\nbricks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All you have to do is unwrap 1 or 2 of the 16 oz bricks of =\r\nbutter and\n&gt; &gt; put it in the glass jar. Put the jar in the crock pot and co=\r\nver it. In\n&gt; &gt; the morning (i.e. 4-6 hours later), you&#39;ll have ghee with so=\r\nme curds\n&gt; &gt; at the bottom. You can carefully pour out the ghee into anothe=\r\nr vessel\n&gt; &gt; and throw out the curds at the bottom with very little waste. =\r\nThere is\n&gt; &gt; no need for a strainer or anything else if you are careful.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The glass bottle and relatively low heat make it easy to clean up.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Since the ghee has been slowly melted over a period of time, it\n&gt; &gt; retai=\r\nns the heat for much longer when compared to microwaving it. If\n&gt; &gt; you hav=\r\ne left over ghee, you can simply put it in any glass bottle\n&gt; &gt; that will f=\r\nit in the crock pot, and then remelt it overnight for the\n&gt; &gt; next morning.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is the simplest, cleanest, cheapest solution that I&#39;ve come\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; across.
