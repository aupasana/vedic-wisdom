You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to=\r\n 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 7=\r\n00 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with=\r\n 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a s=\r\nhort rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) =\r\ntotalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do specia=\r\nl rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How=\r\n to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Cha=\r\nndi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be l=\r\nearnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about b=\r\nut I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and=\r\n learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recentl=\r\ny. \n\nNagraj Kota\n\n\n"}}
