That is a prantha without ghee? It can satiate your hunger, but =\r\nyou always know, that something was missing. A sookha fulka is a little les=\r\ns joyous to eat than one with ghee. Don&#39;t use the word &#39;dosha&#39; it will driv=\r\ne people away. It is not a dosha. Mr Agni likes the offering with ghee, he =\r\nprefers it that way, but accepts it otherwise too. Not offering with ghee d=\r\noes not result in a &#39;dosha&#39; in the traditional sense of the word. See, the =\r\nperson who said that it results in &#39;dosha&#39; might have a very different defi=\r\nnition of this word, to the one that many will comprehend. For him/her, it =\r\nmight be regular usage for a simple &#39;fault&#39;, for somebody reading it might =\r\nbe &quot; OMFG, What the hell have I done? I did a Dosha for so long!!&quot; Oh well,=\r\n calm down. Even if you committed a dosha, what the hell have you been doin=\r\ng when you are reading that &quot;anagyatam, yadagyatam, yagasya kriyte mithu...=\r\n.&quot;\n section. You are apologizing specifically to Mr Agni, aren&#39;t you? Thus =\r\nyou have already said sorry for this, so next time onwards, just put a litt=\r\nle ghee to whatever you offer. it helps Mr Agni, to carry it forward or to =\r\naccept it depending on the situation, and as you are hosting him it is your=\r\n paramount duty to take care of him when he comes. He comes and actually do=\r\nes a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerates our foolishness and ignorance a=\r\nnd does not burn our house/us down in anger=C2=A0 ( very capable of doing s=\r\no ), thus help him out and treat him with honor. He is a living being. bein=\r\ng hot is his nature, I am not talking about Paris hilton waala &quot;hot&quot; here. =\r\nAn offering with ghee, helps him out when compared to a dry one, but he sti=\r\nll accepts the latter, but prefers the former.\n\n\t* Regarding the ratios and=\r\n everything else ----=C2=A0 \nA purusha-acharana is too complex and requires=\r\n an extreme amount of discipline to complete. Concepts detailing to mantra =\r\nsiddhi and all that, but walk on to these paths when the basics are there. =\r\nThe best part is , when the basics are complete, god will automatically gra=\r\nduate you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or 10 years, or 10 months, =\r\nwho the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form of your god you are wor=\r\nshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are, need not worry about t=\r\nhe ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that you become &quot;big&quot; enough t=\r\no apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you are headed down some speci=\r\nfic route, and you need to do it as per instructions from your teacher( god=\r\n )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If you are getting confused with 10 times=\r\n then one, or 100 times then one or what om and what tarpyami or what swaha=\r\n..... chuck it. Just offer the mantra in the fire, with utter sincerity and=\r\n forget that you ever\n offered too. If you are to be taken on a path that r=\r\nequires the ratios, you will be taken, no issues. Till then, keep offering =\r\nthe single repetition just like, you are now. Unless and until, significant=\r\n penance is done, theory about ratios and how it all works, will go over ou=\r\nr heads, and confuse even further. It is useless to discuss it, will only g=\r\nive rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend time chanting instead.=\r\n\n\n\t* One more pointer, since I think I read somewhere as to how we can impr=\r\nove our homams. Offer any thing to the fire with love, I sometimes notice, =\r\npeople throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the fear of getting burnt, pullin=\r\ng the hand away extremely quickly. Remember you are feeding someone, and th=\r\nat someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the one who sits in front of you an=\r\nd makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mother feeds her child bites of fo=\r\nod, even though the fingers are always at risk of getting bitten and coming=\r\n back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se pyaar se, feed Mr Agni, he will=\r\n appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you can modify your hand movement and=\r\n integrate some grace in the way an offering is made, doesn&#39;t matter even i=\r\nf it is made from a distance. It can take some time getting used to, practi=\r\nce makes perfect!=C2=A0\n\t* A sub pointer in improving your homam is the app=\r\nreciation of the fact of the suffering of the offering! Bow down to your go=\r\nlas , the tils , the mithai,=C2=A0 the ghee, &quot;spiritual progress tumhaari, =\r\njalegi humari&quot; seems to be the chant from whatever you are offering!! LOL .=\r\n Mind you, somebody is jumping straight in to Mr agni&#39;s mouth on your behes=\r\nt, the gola nariyaal you so gladly cut inside out, ouch the pain!! Because =\r\nthose too are manifestations of the same divine and their sacrifice is supr=\r\neme, thus bow down and sincerely thank god for manifesting and providing yo=\r\nu the material to do this wonderful ritual.\nRam Ram\n-- Baccha Singh\nNow wat=\r\nch this and laugh your ass off.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DntQkgeko_i=\r\n8\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Jay bhai,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aaapne chopdi na thotha bahu vaanchya ane =\r\nbahu dahi dahi vato kari ne pravachan aapya.

Hmm... let me see... Hm=\r\nm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home r=\r\negularly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this point=\r\ned question because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you a=\r\nre doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does no=\r\nt seem to be right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of g=\r\nhee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha i=\r\nn my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required =\r\nJapa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra tha=\r\nt you use for your regular japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? I=\r\ns there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatams=\r\nha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becom=\r\nes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for e=\r\nvery 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahu=\r\nti)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what =\r\nI read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with=\r\n that book series)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. P=\r\nurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or=\r\n at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The conversation w=\r\nent onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesh=\r\na from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the same=\r\n mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and hav=\r\ne been very happy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whether all t=\r\nhe homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to po=\r\nint this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa =\r\nof the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n \r\n---347748201-1229069254-1351056753=:57443\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-fa=\r\nmily: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;Dear ,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: transparent; &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&n=\r\nbsp; Wow..what an analogy...i &nbsp;will &nbsp;always &nbsp;appreciate &nbs=\r\np;the &nbsp;kindness &nbsp;of &nbsp;offering&nbsp;&nbsp;to the ALIVE &nbsp;=\r\nthing in the fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;=\r\n, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); backgroun=\r\nd-color: transparent; font-style: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excellent replies..!!! &n=\r\nbsp;Keep posting more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new ro=\r\nman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12=\r\npt; &quot;&gt;Cheerss&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;=\r\n, times,\n serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;Just Gaurav&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, =\r\nserif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;n=\r\new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt; &quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;F=\r\nrom:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; scsa_taker3 &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, October 24=\r\n, 2012 1:45 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Homam - Ahuti numbers&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv2072351489&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2072351489ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div=\r\n&gt;\n\n\nRam Ram,&lt;br&gt;( Play this while reading -----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://ww=\r\nw.youtube.com/watch?v=3DIn3XdRxI-kA&nbsp; )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A couple of points -----=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghee and the Dry offering&nbsp; ------- Have you ever=\r\n had a sookhi roti? That is a prantha without ghee? It can satiate your hun=\r\nger, but you always know, that something was missing. A sookha fulka is a l=\r\nittle less joyous to eat than one with ghee. Don&#39;t use the word &#39;dosha&#39; it =\r\nwill drive people away. It is not a dosha. Mr Agni likes the offering with =\r\nghee, he prefers it that way, but accepts it otherwise too. Not offering wi=\r\nth ghee does not result in a &#39;dosha&#39; in the traditional sense of the word. =\r\nSee, the person who said that it results in &#39;dosha&#39; might have a very diffe=\r\nrent definition of this word, to the one that many will comprehend. For him=\r\n/her, it might be regular usage for a simple &#39;fault&#39;, for somebody reading =\r\nit might be &quot; OMFG, What the hell have I done? I did a Dosha for so\n long!!=\r\n&quot; Oh well, calm down. Even if you committed a dosha, what the hell have you=\r\n been doing when you are reading that &quot;anagyatam, yadagyatam, yagasya kriyt=\r\ne mithu....&quot; section. You are apologizing specifically to Mr Agni, aren&#39;t y=\r\nou? Thus you have already said sorry for this, so next time onwards, just p=\r\nut a little ghee to whatever you offer. it helps Mr Agni, to carry it forwa=\r\nrd or to accept it depending on the situation, and as you are hosting him i=\r\nt is your paramount duty to take care of him when he comes. He comes and ac=\r\ntually does a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerates our foolishness and ig=\r\nnorance and does not burn our house/us down in anger&nbsp; ( very capable o=\r\nf doing so ), thus help him out and treat him with honor. He is a living be=\r\ning. being hot is his nature, I am not talking about Paris hilton waala &quot;ho=\r\nt&quot; here. An offering with ghee, helps him out when compared to a dry one, b=\r\nut he still accepts the latter, but prefers the\n former.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regard=\r\ning the ratios and everything else ----&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;A purusha-acharana is too=\r\n complex and requires an extreme amount of discipline to complete. Concepts=\r\n detailing to mantra siddhi and all that, but walk on to these paths when t=\r\nhe basics are there. The best part is , when the basics are complete, god w=\r\nill automatically graduate you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or 10 =\r\nyears, or 10 months, who the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form of=\r\n your god you are worshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are, n=\r\need not worry about the ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that you =\r\nbecome &quot;big&quot; enough to apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you are h=\r\neaded down some specific route, and you need to do it as per instructions f=\r\nrom your teacher( god )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If you are getting c=\r\nonfused with 10 times then one, or 100 times then one or what om and what t=\r\narpyami or what swaha..... chuck it. Just\n offer the mantra in the fire, wi=\r\nth utter sincerity and forget that you ever offered too. If you are to be t=\r\naken on a path that requires the ratios, you will be taken, no issues. Till=\r\n then, keep offering the single repetition just like, you are now. Unless a=\r\nnd until, significant penance is done, theory about ratios and how it all w=\r\norks, will go over our heads, and confuse even further. It is useless to di=\r\nscuss it, will only give rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend t=\r\nime chanting instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One more pointer, since I think I read so=\r\nmewhere as to how we can improve our homams. Offer any thing to the fire wi=\r\nth love, I sometimes notice, people throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the =\r\nfear of getting burnt, pulling the hand away extremely quickly. Remember yo=\r\nu are feeding someone, and that someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the on=\r\ne who sits in front of you and makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mothe=\r\nr feeds her child bites of food,\n even though the fingers are always at ris=\r\nk of getting bitten and coming back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se p=\r\nyaar se, feed Mr Agni, he will appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you can=\r\n modify your hand movement and integrate some grace in the way an offering =\r\nis made, doesn&#39;t matter even if it is made from a distance. It can take som=\r\ne time getting used to, practice makes perfect!&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sub pointer=\r\n in improving your homam is the appreciation of the fact of the suffering o=\r\nf the offering! Bow down to your golas , the tils , the mithai,&nbsp; the g=\r\nhee, &quot;spiritual progress tumhaari, jalegi humari&quot; seems to be the chant fro=\r\nm whatever you are offering!! LOL . Mind you, somebody is jumping straight =\r\nin to Mr agni&#39;s mouth on your behest, the gola nariyaal you so gladly cut i=\r\nnside out, ouch the pain!!

Hmm... let me\n see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be pe=\r\nrforming some kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this pointed questio=\r\nn because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni kar=\r\nya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti=\r\n does not seem to be right.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am usi=\r\nng Til (sesame seeds).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You sh=\r\nould mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti ap=\r\nart from that?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do requ=\r\nired Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantr=\r\na that you use for your regular japa?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Myself: Wh=\r\nat?... Required Japa? Is there\n a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any=\r\n pre-defined set of japa?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes=\r\n. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recita=\r\ntion of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at=\r\n least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in =\r\nmeditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; My=\r\nself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghor=\r\ne book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that book seri=\r\nes)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything=\r\n. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100=\r\n or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; The conversation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on =\r\nto get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra an=\r\nd also using the same\n mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentio=\r\nned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group a=\r\ngree with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting ever=\r\nybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get=\r\n the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---347748201-1229069254-1351056753=:57443--\r\n\n"}}
