I just wan=\r\nted to share my thoughts regarding the same. \n\nIf the intention is only to =\r\ndo good to the departed soul and sense of duty towards one parents.I do not=\r\n see any problem why this should not be done.In fact one of the gurus I fol=\r\nlow often narrates the incident of people always scaring even good intentio=\r\nned ones from the Srividya path of worship of the goddess. My guru openly s=\r\nays one can keep the SriChakra Meru in one&#39;s house and perform an simple pu=\r\nja as long as the place if kept clean and some basic rules are followed. Th=\r\nere will be thousands if not hundreds of schools which will take up arms ag=\r\nainst that suggestion claiming that one would have to do an elaborate puja =\r\nfor 3 hrs to even attempt something like that.\n\nWhy should I one fear appro=\r\naching the mother in any form.Even in the fire of the Smashana she is still=\r\n one&#39;s mother. Whatever she gives she knows best.\n\nJust trust the inner voi=\r\nce also known as the &quot;atma guru &quot; . The beautiful FAQ section that Narasimh=\r\na ji has written for the homa manual already answers some of these question=\r\ns in a subtle way.\n\n\nFor every puja you do in the world there will be 100 o=\r\nthers who claim you are not allowed to do it. Nothing should stand between =\r\na devotee and God. I am not trying to downplay the role of Intiation or rul=\r\nes....if somebody is Intiated into a certain process good for them. He or s=\r\nhe will start off with a million dollars in the bank. It does not man any o=\r\nther commoner with great intentions should not work towards gaining those m=\r\nillion dollars on his own.\n\n\nLike I said if the action is not going to resu=\r\nlt in guilt or fear for you , do not hesitate to take up any sadhana or act=\r\nion. Just listen to your inner voice.\n\n:) Even for doing a homa one can com=\r\nplicate it a thousand fold with deciding to find out if Agni is residing in=\r\n earth,heavens or the netherworld.One can also search for the perfect muhur=\r\nta.One can try to clean the floor a thousand times to make sure it is spotl=\r\ness...I am not providing an excuse for being lazy. As long as one does his =\r\nbest to his given maximum ...for all shakti flows from her.One should relax=\r\n and surrender to her wishes.\n\n\nWhen one is a beggar at her doorstep there =\r\nis nothing to fear...When one approaches her as a child there is nothing to=\r\n fear. \n\nRegards\nVemparla RamKishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rama,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I don&#39;t have =\r\na brother either, hence I posted this question.=C2=A0I felt=C2=A0if women c=\r\nan do homams,tarpanam then may be this rite would be acceptable too.=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0I asked about doing homams in smashan is because of the be=\r\nnefit a soul gets when one prays on it,=C2=A0that&#39;s all.....not for=C2=A0sp=\r\niritual progress, shakti or any other intention.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Mind kee=\r\nps juggling between Lord Vishnu and the Goddess.

The individuals who stuck to basics, not trying =\r\nvipareeta (extreme) rituals made better progress than the enthusiastic ones=\r\n whose goal was to experience gopi bhAva, etc sooner. I remember your mails=\r\n where you mentioned worshipping Ugra devata did not work for you at one po=\r\nint of time, so this mail surprised me ! \n&gt; I am taking liberty in adding m=\r\nore than normally I do.
