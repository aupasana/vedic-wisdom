Nayana prostrated before me=\r\n and then asked the little boy to do\nlikewise.\n\nHe appeared not to have hea=\r\nrd it and, with an air of indifference, kept\nquiet. Nayana too did not mind=\r\n it. Then,all of a sudden, that boy prostrated\nbefore me in full length (Sa=\r\nshtanga namaskaram).\n\nLike a young boy who has had his Thread Ceremony he p=\r\nlaced his hands on his\nears and then touched my feet.\n\nI wondered how that =\r\nlittle boy could have known the correct procedure of\nprostration and felt t=\r\nhat it must have come from family traditions.=94\n\n=93You know what I did on=\r\ne day? Seating Mahadeva on my back I began swimming\nin the tank opposite th=\r\ne Pachiamman Shrine from one end to the other.\n\nWhen we were halfway throug=\r\nh he began pressing me down, greatly elated,\nshouting =91Aha, Hai!=92 as ca=\r\nrt drivers do to their bullocks.\n\nAnother devotee enquired if it were a fac=\r\nt that Bhagavan and Nayana used to\nswim in the Pandava Tank.\n\nBhagavan repl=\r\nied, =93Yes. That also was only in those days.We used to try to\nexcel each =\r\nother in swimming. That was great fun.=94\n\nAnother devotee said, =93It seem=\r\ns you played marbles with children?=94\n\nBhagavan replied, =93Yes. That was =\r\nso. That too was while we were in the\nVirupaksha Cave. The holes dug for th=\r\ne purpose of playing marbles must be\nthere even now. Those\nchildren sometim=\r\nes used to bring packets of sweets.We all shared them.\n\nDuring Dipavali the=\r\ny used to put aside my share of crackers and bring them\nup to me.
