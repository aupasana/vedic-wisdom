I stay in a single room=\r\n accomodation (1 room and kitchen). Is it fine for me to follow the Tarpana=\r\nm procedure in this room itself? I actually do not have access to any other=\r\n private place. I intend to start this procedure during this Mahalaya Paksh=\r\nam.\n\nAlso, it would be great if you could kindly throw some light on other =\r\nfavourable/auspicious activities during this period which would appease the=\r\n Pitris. \n\nApologies if these questions have already been asked. Awaiting y=\r\nour kind guidance.\n\nWarm Regards,\nRamesh M\n\n\n\n      See the Web&#39;s break=\r\ning stories, chosen by people like you. Check out Yahoo!
