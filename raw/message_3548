But the fullness of the supramental change is not possible, if the =\r\nbody remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, pain, unconsciousn=\r\ness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are to remain the desc=\r\nent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change of consciousness =\r\nwhich would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine, the Overmind is =\r\nsufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supramental Descent is =\r\nnecessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vital and body. This=\r\n would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disappearence of the unconsciousnes=\r\ns of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or disease. That woul=\r\nd mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by which death comes. =\r\nIf a change in the body had to be made, it would be by the will of the inha=\r\nbitant. This would be the essence of physical\n immortality. If someone want=\r\ned to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had the complete siddhi, =\r\nit would not be impossible. There can be no immortality of the body without=\r\n supramentalization. &quot;\n=C2=A0\nAgain at another place Sri Aurobindo states t=\r\nhat immoratlity is not the aim of Supramental Descent, but one of the possi=\r\nbilities.\n=C2=A0\nI did not quite understand, what exactly is this Suprament=\r\nal Descent, if it has nothing to do with physical immortality. Because, con=\r\nnecting the and uplifting the ordinary mind to the state of divinity and fu=\r\nnctioning from that sphere is something that most self realized Yogis do. T=\r\nhen how is &quot;Supramental Descent&quot; so unique?\n=C2=A0\nAgain if, as we see from=\r\n the above writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken off, th=\r\nat would mean also a transformation of the body. \n=C2=A0\nWell, the Naths(ni=\r\nne Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane.

It is surprising to see that after=\r\n being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo&#39;s teachings with physical im=\r\nmortality.\n\nIt is also factually incorrect that disciples of Sri Aurobindo =\r\nand Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Balaram Reddy seems =\r\nto confuse his imaginations for facts.\n\nThere were several instances when M=\r\nother and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away to Ramanashram saying the=\r\ny are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi than the Integral Yoga. =\r\nI know of atleast one case (there could be several) where Ramana Maharishi =\r\nsent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were meant for the path of I=\r\nntegral Yoga. \n\nIt is very possible that Ramana Maharishi might have said s=\r\nomething specific to Balaram Reddy to\n help him come out of his guilt consc=\r\niousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram without full consent of his Gu=\r\nru. We need to take Balaram Reddy&#39;s recollections and opinions (especially =\r\nhis assumptions and interpolations) with a big pinch of salt. \n\n-Shiva.\n\n--=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@ ...=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In 1931, after reading about Sri Aurobindo, and also hearing =\r\nabout him from\n&gt; others, I made my way to his ashrama in Pondicherry. Immed=\r\niately upon my\n&gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the pl=\r\nace. On August\n&gt; 15th of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo=\r\n. This was one of\n&gt; three times in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sri=\r\n Aurobindo and Mother\n&gt; to be\n powerful spiritual personalities, as they se=\r\nemed to have the ability\n&gt; to work on the development of their disciples in=\r\n a silent and invisible\n&gt; manner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings=\r\n cannot convey his or the\n&gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhile I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; disci=\r\nple of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then\n&gt; visiting =\r\nSri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; ashrama. H=\r\nis intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.\n&gt; Narasimhaswam=\r\ni&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit\n&gt; to Ramana=\r\nsramam in 1933.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before this second visit to Ramanasramam I once again =\r\nread Bhagavan&#39;s\n&gt; biography. In it I found a passage relating to the possib=\r\nility of changing\n&gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it t=\r\no the\n Maharshi. He\n&gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. Wh=\r\nat of that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, w=\r\nas regulated and\n&gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip int=\r\no town we had to\n&gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it =\r\nwas totally\n&gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, inf=\r\normality and\n&gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the same time =\r\nelevating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally permit=\r\nted to visit all\n&gt; other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Mah=\r\narshi and Sri\n&gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the pow=\r\ner to undo years\n&gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo w=\r\nere effecting on the\n&gt; psyche of their followers. In other words, they cons=\r\nidered the Maharshi too\n&gt; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was\n aware of thi=\r\ns and once when I was alone\n&gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that pla=\r\nce. They are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram\n&gt; \n&gt; I had been w=\r\nith the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years\n&gt; they show=\r\nered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the spiritual\n&gt; path. M=\r\ny gratitude and regard for them compelled me to obtain their\n&gt; permission a=\r\nnd blessings before leaving. This turned out to be much more\n&gt; difficult th=\r\nan I imagined.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo Ashram, it was the practice of the discipl=\r\nes who had doubts or\n&gt; questions to write them in the form of a letter to S=\r\nri Aurobindo. All the\n&gt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo=\r\n, who would sit with the\n&gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer the=\r\nm in writing. Sometimes we\n&gt; would see the lights burning all night as they=\r\n were engaged in this work.\n&gt;\n \n&gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote =\r\na letter stating my desire to\n&gt; receive their blessings and permission to l=\r\nive at Ramanasramam. In the\n&gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that since your y=\r\noga begins with\n&gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me to go to Ramana Mahars=\r\nhi who emphasizes\n&gt; only Self-realization, a state I have not attained, or =\r\nmay not even be\n&gt; worthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, =\r\nbut negative in\n&gt; regards to my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-re=\r\nalization and the\n&gt; supra-mental state can be simultaneously developed and =\r\nachieved here. There\n&gt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was extremel=\r\ny disappointed at his response and consequently became\n&gt; frustrated, restle=\r\nss and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights\n&gt; and felt distra=\r\nught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same\n&gt; request. Ag=\r\nain I was\n denied permission. It took a long five months and a\n&gt; third lett=\r\ner before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their\n&gt; permis=\r\nsion and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and\n&gt; they=\r\n saw no other recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final l=\r\netter to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\n&gt; follow a path in which=\r\n you can achieve only partial realization, we give you\n&gt; our blessings, tho=\r\nugh we believe it would be better if you stayed on here\n&gt; and pursued your =\r\nsadhana where both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was the rule in =\r\nAurobindo Ashram that any letter written to or received\n&gt; from Aurobindo sh=\r\nould not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this\n&gt; rule, I burnt=\r\n all my letters, except the final letter I received from\n&gt; Aurobindo. This =\r\nI kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Settling\n at Sri Raman=\r\nasramam\n&gt; \n&gt; During the early years there were no houses anywhere near the =\r\nashram, as it\n&gt; was mostly jungle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs=\r\n room in a\n&gt; brahmin&#39;s house near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my mea=\r\nls I would\n&gt; sometimes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food f=\r\nrom somewhere\n&gt; outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in =\r\nthe\n&gt; hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again =\r\nto the\n&gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on like this =\r\nduring the\n&gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close to Bhagavan =\r\nso I could\n&gt; hear all of his precious utterances.\n&gt; \n&gt; S. S. Cohen, after r=\r\nepeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the\n&gt; Yogi from Pondich=\r\nerry must have some greatness.\n Consequently, one day he\n&gt; travelled to Pon=\r\ndicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\n&gt; describing who he was,=\r\n what he wanted from life (Self-realization) and where\n&gt; he was then residi=\r\nng (Sri Ramanasramam) . Cohen later showed me the reply he\n&gt; got from Aurob=\r\nindo. It said, in brief, that all his aspirations could be\n&gt; fulfilled at S=\r\nri Ramanasramam, where he was then living.\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember during my second=\r\n visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day\n&gt; reading a lengthy book re=\r\nview from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s Lights on =\r\nYoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of\n&gt; this newspaper was=\r\n Bhagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take\n&gt; great interest=\r\n in the review and would occasionally stop reading and comment\n&gt; on what he=\r\n had just read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded\n&gt; reading=\r\n it, someone who was\n aware that I had that very book with me, said to\n&gt; Bh=\r\nagavan, &quot;This man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book\n&gt;=\r\n with him.&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\n=\r\n&gt; look at it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it =\r\nover to Bhagavan.\n&gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He kept=\r\n on reading it well\n&gt; into the night, with the help of a small oil lamp, un=\r\ntil he finished it.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I came into the hall the next day he began di=\r\nscussing the book with me,\n&gt; telling me that a certain term used in the boo=\r\nk might look like something\n&gt; new, but it is actually the equivalent of thi=\r\ns other term used in such and\n&gt; such ancient text, etc. Like this, he went =\r\non discussing and comparing\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhaga=\r\nvan thoroughly understood\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and =\r\nalso\n from the standpoint of\n&gt; experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; One evening I said to Bhaga=\r\nvan that the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; teachings is that it profess=\r\nes that immortality of the body can be achieved.\n&gt; Bhagavan made no comment=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat down, Bhagav=\r\nan\n&gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam there was one yogi, C. =\r\nV. V.\n&gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of the immortality of=\r\n the\n&gt; body. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a\n&gt; d=\r\nistinguished public and spiritual personality in India) would have to come\n=\r\n&gt; to him to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he had a chanc=\r\ne\n&gt; to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illustrate=\r\nd his\n&gt; point.\n&gt; \n&gt; On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ra=\r\nmanasramam, I\n&gt; approached Bhagavan when no\n one was in the hall and showed=\r\n him that last\n&gt; letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to=\r\n give it to him to\n&gt; read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobi=\r\nndo&#39;s handwriting, as\n&gt; it was very illegible and only those who have studi=\r\ned it for sometime could\n&gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; After looking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words,=\r\n he\n&gt; returned it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when =\r\nI came\n&gt; to the sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in whi=\r\nch you can\n&gt; achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me a=\r\nnd said,\n&gt; &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, a=\r\nnd if it is\n&gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This was the final blow=\r\n that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this\n&gt; letter, like all the =\r\nrest. And because of all the\n discussions I had had with\n&gt; Bhagavan I soon =\r\nfelt perfectly established in his teachings, having a clear\n&gt; understanding=\r\n of where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\n&gt; went diff=\r\nerent ways. When all the clouds of doubts and distractions\n&gt; dispersed, so =\r\ndid our discussions. Bhagavan then knew that I understood and\n&gt; the foundat=\r\nion work had been done.

But the fullness of the supramental change is not poss=\r\nible, if the body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, pain,=\r\n unconsciousness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are to re=\r\nmain the descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change of c=\r\nonsciousness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine, the=\r\n Overmind is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supramenta=\r\nl Descent is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vital a=\r\nnd body. This would imply as&nbsp;a final result the disappearence of the u=\r\nnconsciousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or disea=\r\nse. That would mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by which =\r\ndeath comes. If a change in the body had to be made, it would be by the wil=\r\nl of the inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical\n immortality. If=\r\n someone wanted to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had the comp=\r\nlete siddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be no immortality of the=\r\n body without supramentalization. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Again at a=\r\nnother place Sri Aurobindo states that immoratlity is not the aim of Supram=\r\nental Descent, but one of the possibilities.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I=\r\n did not quite understand, what exactly is this Supramental Descent, if it =\r\nhas nothing to do with physical immortality. Because, connecting the and up=\r\nlifting the ordinary mind to the state of divinity and functioning from tha=\r\nt sphere is something that most self realized Yogis do. Then how is &quot;Supram=\r\nental Descent&quot; so unique?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Again if, as we see =\r\nfrom the above writings, a total transformation is what is being spoken off=\r\n, that would mean also a transformation of the body. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Well, the Naths(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist as immortal=\r\ns in this plane. Is that what Supramental Descent is?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: nav=\r\ny; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Courie=\r\nr&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/str=\r\nong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sat, 23/1/10, schinnas &lt;i&gt;&=\r\nlt;schinnas@gmail. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-l=\r\neft: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: schinnas &lt;schinnas@gmail. co=\r\nm&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Part 1- The Recollections of Ramana Ma=\r\nharshi Devotee N.

Immediately upon my&lt;br&gt;&gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosp=\r\nhere of the place. On August&lt;br&gt;&gt; 15th of that year, I had my first dars=\r\nhan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of&lt;br&gt;&gt; three times in a year that he=\r\n gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother&lt;br&gt;&gt; to be\n powerful spi=\r\nritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability&lt;br&gt;&gt; to work on=\r\n the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible&lt;br&gt;&gt; manne=\r\nr. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his or the&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; While I was in=\r\n Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed&lt;br&gt;&gt; disciple of =\r\nboth Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then&lt;br&gt;&gt; visiting S=\r\nri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his&lt;br&gt;&gt; ashra=\r\nma.. His intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.&lt;br&gt;&gt; N=\r\narasimhaswami&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; to Ramanasramam in 1933.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Before this second visit=\r\n to Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagavan&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; biography. In it I fo=\r\nund a passage relating to the possibility of changing&lt;br&gt;&gt; one&#39;s guru. I=\r\n had a doubt about this and addressed it to the\n Maharshi. He&lt;br&gt;&gt; told =\r\nme, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What of that?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulated an=\r\nd&lt;br&gt;&gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into town we=\r\n had to&lt;br&gt;&gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it was=\r\n totally&lt;br&gt;&gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, =\r\ninformality and&lt;br&gt;&gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the s=\r\name time elevating.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples =\r\nwere generally permitted to visit all&lt;br&gt;&gt; other saints and ashramas, wi=\r\nth the exception of the Maharshi and Sri&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ramanasramam. It was belie=\r\nved that the Maharshi had the power to undo years&lt;br&gt;&gt; of spiritual prep=\r\naration that the Mother and Aurobindo were effecting on the&lt;br&gt;&gt; psyche =\r\nof their followers. In other words, they considered the Maharshi too&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was\n aware of this and once when I was al=\r\none&lt;br&gt;&gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. They are afrai=\r\nd of me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I had =\r\nbeen with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; they showered me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the spiritu=\r\nal&lt;br&gt;&gt; path. My gratitude and regard for them compelled me to obtain th=\r\neir&lt;br&gt;&gt; permission and blessings before leaving. This turned out to be =\r\nmuch more&lt;br&gt;&gt; difficult than I imagined.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In Aurobindo =\r\nAshram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or&lt;br&gt;&gt; ques=\r\ntions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with =\r\nthe&lt;br&gt;&gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writing. S=\r\nometimes we&lt;br&gt;&gt; would see the lights burning all night as they were eng=\r\naged in this work.&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wro=\r\nte a letter stating my desire to&lt;br&gt;&gt; receive their blessings and permis=\r\nsion to live at Ramanasramam. In the&lt;br&gt;&gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote th=\r\nat since your yoga begins with&lt;br&gt;&gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me t=\r\no go to Ramana Maharshi who emphasizes&lt;br&gt;&gt; only Self-realization, a sta=\r\nte I have not attained, or may not even be&lt;br&gt;&gt; worthy of attaining. Aur=\r\nobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but negative in&lt;br&gt;&gt; regards to my leav=\r\ning his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-realization and the&lt;br&gt;&gt; supra-ment=\r\nal state can be simultaneously developed and achieved here. There&lt;br&gt;&gt; i=\r\ns no need for you to go there.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I was extremely disappoint=\r\ned at his response and consequently became&lt;br&gt;&gt; frustrated, restless and=\r\n discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights&lt;br&gt;&gt; and felt distra=\r\nught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same&lt;br&gt;&gt; reque=\r\nst. Again I was\n denied permission. It took a long five months and a&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; third letter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me th=\r\neir&lt;br&gt;&gt; permission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determine=\r\nd to go and&lt;br&gt;&gt; they saw no other recourse but to grant my request..&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final letter to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are d=\r\netermined to&lt;br&gt;&gt; follow a path in which you can achieve only partial re=\r\nalization, we give you&lt;br&gt;&gt; our blessings, though we believe it would be=\r\n better if you stayed on here&lt;br&gt;&gt; and pursued your sadhana where both t=\r\nhe Mother and I can help you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; It was the rule in Aurobind=\r\no Ashram that any letter written to or received&lt;br&gt;&gt; from Aurobindo shou=\r\nld not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this&lt;br&gt;&gt; rule, I b=\r\nurnt all my letters, except the final letter I received from&lt;br&gt;&gt; Aurobi=\r\nndo. This I kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nSettling\n at Sri Ramanasramam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; During the early years there=\r\n were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it&lt;br&gt;&gt; was mostly jungle o=\r\nr forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a&lt;br&gt;&gt; brahmin&#39;s house =\r\nnear the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would&lt;br&gt;&gt; sometimes =\r\ncook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere&lt;br&gt;&gt; o=\r\nutside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n Daily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again=\r\n to the&lt;br&gt;&gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on lik=\r\ne this during the&lt;br&gt;&gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close=\r\n to Bhagavan so I could&lt;br&gt;&gt; hear all of his precious utterances.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; S. S. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decid=\r\ned that the&lt;br&gt;&gt; Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness.\n Conseq=\r\nuently, one day he&lt;br&gt;&gt; travelled to Pondicherry and while there wrote a=\r\n note to Aurobindo&lt;br&gt;&gt; describing who he was, what he wanted from life =\r\n(Self-realization) and where&lt;br&gt;&gt; he was then residing (Sri Ramanasramam=\r\n) . Cohen later showed me the reply he&lt;br&gt;&gt; got from Aurobindo.. It said=\r\n, in brief, that all his aspirations could be&lt;br&gt;&gt; fulfilled at Sri Rama=\r\nnasramam, where he was then living.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I remember during my s=\r\necond visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day&lt;br&gt;&gt; reading a leng=\r\nthy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was&lt;br&gt;&gt; Aurob=\r\nindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed t=\r\no take&lt;br&gt;&gt; great interest in the review and would occasionally stop rea=\r\nding and comment&lt;br&gt;&gt; on what he had just read to those sitting around h=\r\nim. When he had concluded&lt;br&gt;&gt; reading it, someone who was\n aware that I=\r\n had that very book with me, said to&lt;br&gt;&gt; Bhagavan, &quot;This man has come f=\r\nrom the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book&lt;br&gt;&gt; with him.&quot; Bhagavan t=\r\nurned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a&lt;br&gt;&gt; look at it.&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over=\r\n to Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He ke=\r\npt on reading it well&lt;br&gt;&gt; into the night, with the help of a small oil =\r\nlamp, until he finished it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; When I came into the hall the =\r\nnext day he began discussing the book with me,&lt;br&gt;&gt; telling me that a ce=\r\nrtain term used in the book might look like something&lt;br&gt;&gt; new, but it i=\r\ns actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and&lt;br&gt;&gt; such =\r\nancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing&lt;br&gt;&gt; A=\r\nurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also\n from the standpoint=\r\n of&lt;br&gt;&gt; experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan tha=\r\nt the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; teachings is that it professe=\r\ns that immortality of the body can be achieved.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Bhagavan made no co=\r\nmment.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and=\r\n sat down, Bhagavan&lt;br&gt;&gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam =\r\nthere was one yogi, C. V. V.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his d=\r\noctrine of the immortality of the&lt;br&gt;&gt; body. He was even so bold as to d=\r\neclare that Dr. Annie Besant (a&lt;br&gt;&gt; distinguished public and spiritual =\r\npersonality in India) would have to come&lt;br&gt;&gt; to him to learn how to mak=\r\ne her body immortal. But, before he had a chance&lt;br&gt;&gt; to meet Dr. Annie =\r\nBesant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illustrated his&lt;br&gt;&gt; point.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ramana=\r\nsramam, I&lt;br&gt;&gt; approached Bhagavan when no\n one was in the hall and show=\r\ned him that last&lt;br&gt;&gt; letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan ask=\r\ned me to give it to him to&lt;br&gt;&gt; read. I told him he would be unable to d=\r\necipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwriting, as&lt;br&gt;&gt; it was very illegible and only =\r\nthose who have studied it for sometime could&lt;br&gt;&gt; read it.. He said, &quot;Gi=\r\nve it to me. Let me try.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After looking into it and realiz=\r\ning he could only make out a few words, he&lt;br&gt;&gt; returned it and asked me=\r\n to read it out. I began reading it and when I came&lt;br&gt;&gt; to the sentence=\r\n, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can&lt;br&gt;&gt; achie=\r\nve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\nPartial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it is&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; This was the fina=\r\nl blow that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this&lt;br&gt;&gt; letter, l=\r\nike all the rest. And because of all the\n discussions I had had with&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, having a cle=\r\nar&lt;br&gt;&gt; understanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path =\r\ndiverged and&lt;br&gt;&gt; went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts and=\r\n distractions&lt;br&gt;&gt; dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then knew=\r\n that I understood and&lt;br&gt;&gt; the foundation work had been done. The purpo=\r\nse of all our discussions were&lt;br&gt;&gt; served and so they stopped automatic=\r\nally.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan=\r\n was the power of his&lt;br&gt;&gt; presence. Much of what he taught had already =\r\nbeen transmitted to the masses&lt;br&gt;&gt; down through the ages. In Bhagavan w=\r\ne found a being that was surcharged with&lt;br&gt;&gt; the Reality to such an ext=\r\nent that coming into his presence would effect a&lt;br&gt;&gt; dramatic change in=\r\n us.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sources:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; a) &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;\n href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmay=\r\n-jun&quot;&gt;http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmay-jun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; b) &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.o=\r\nrg/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmar-apr&quot;&gt;http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/=\r\n1995/? pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; c) &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\narunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-aug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -- &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; =D1=80=E2=96=91&quot;=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=92 =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B8=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96=91=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9B =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BD=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=\r\n=A7=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=97 =D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96=92=D0=90 =D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96=91=\r\n=D0=B3=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BF&lt;br&gt;&gt; =D1=80=E2=96=91=\r\n=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=\r\n=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=92=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96=92=D0=9D =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=AC=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=93=D1=80=E2=96=91=\r\n=E2=95=95=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=92=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=92&lt;br&gt;&gt; =D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BA=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=96=91=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=97=D1=80=E2=96=\r\n=91=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=97 =D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=\r\n=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96=91=E2=95=A1=\r\n=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96=91=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96=92=D0=91&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; \nYour Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8. &lt;a=\r\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_=\r\nie8_new/*http://downloads.yahoo.com/in/internetexplorer/&quot;&gt;Get it NOW!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
