My self-identification with this mental object (i.e. thinking that &quot;I am&quot;=\r\n that mental object), is ahamkaara or asmitaa too.

They are seen by the mind. The yoga sutra of Patanjali =\r\nthat you referred to actually defined asmitaa (I-ness) as identification wi=\r\nth ANY instrument that allows one to have experiences.

But let me say some things clearly, I thi=\r\nnk they may help you. It is probably true that you have had some significan=\r\nt spiritual experiences, which is why you speak with authority. I have no p=\r\nroblem with that, and that is why I actually expect to find some wisdom in =\r\nyour words. But see, the problem with spiritual experience is terminology, =\r\nterminology, terminology. Ordinary sensory experiences are easily communica=\r\nted - it is easy to say the word &quot;tree&quot; and you know exactly what I mean - =\r\nbecause trees are available everywhere in common sensory experience. But no=\r\nt so with spiritual experience, they are by definition outside common senso=\r\nry experience! So if you want to communicate your ideas (if you dont that&#39;s=\r\n fine too), you will have to invest some significant time in coming to comm=\r\non ground (with others) before ideas get exchanged for the benefit of all. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will take your current post as an example. I will try to explai=\r\nn my terminology as clearly as possible and you will then see that there is=\r\n some common ground between you and everyone else here: The essential point=\r\n in all our minds when we talk Ahamkara, ego etc is, in very loose essence,=\r\n a &quot;centering principle&quot;, right? It is that centering principle which eithe=\r\nr is, or leads to, the formation of an individuality, no? At every level of=\r\n existence, no? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think you will agree with the above. Now, from =\r\nmy understanding of what you write, when you say Ahamkara is the dominant I=\r\n sense in the physical cosmos, Manas in astral cosmos and Chitta in the cau=\r\nsal cosmos, you are simply in essence trying to convey the fact that at dif=\r\nference levels of existence the actual centers are different, which is prob=\r\nably true. It is common experience that for all of us in everyday experienc=\r\ne, we are not aware of our deeper senses of self (I am not using any loaded=\r\n terms here, simply the loosely defined term &quot;self&quot;). Our senses of self ar=\r\ne clearly body centered. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So what you are trying to do, are at lea=\r\nst what I get from your writings, is to call that body centered sense of se=\r\nlf Ahamkara, right? Whereas everyone else on this forum is using the standa=\r\nrd Upanishadic terms wherein Ahamkara is the centering principle! There is =\r\nonly one underlying centering principle, which creates an apparent sense of=\r\n self in the manas, in the body and everywhere else you mention. Or do you =\r\ndisagree that at the root, there isnt only one causative centering principl=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I could do the above for the rest of your writings and probably=\r\n reach common ground, but it would take time which as I said I am suddenly =\r\nat a shortage of. But it would be easier if you tried and understood the te=\r\nrms as everyone uses them here, so the exchange of ideas and understanding =\r\nwould be much quicker and without the conflict..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSundeep\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nyeeahoo_99&quot; &lt;nitish.arya@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear N=\r\narasimha and Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Thanks for your feedback.

My comments o=\r\nn that is:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta h=\r\nas no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n   Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else =\r\nhas an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate wit=\r\nh each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child=\r\n or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coh=\r\nerently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that c=\r\noordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty =\r\nto interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you=\r\n have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of=\r\n I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;    I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, wh=\r\nich one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkar=\r\naka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea=\r\n of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says =\r\n&quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someon=\r\ne says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s aha=\r\nmkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though no=\r\nthing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. Whe=\r\nn somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the ph=\r\nysical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being c=\r\nalled&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-n=\r\ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppo=\r\nse one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about th=\r\ne physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dr=\r\neams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself,=\r\n but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;=\r\n. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is sti=\r\nll a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness =\r\nor ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to p=\r\nhysical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond =\r\nthe physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni=\r\n do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is =\r\nincorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and th=\r\nis is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everythin=\r\ng he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized=\r\n consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;contro=\r\nl&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual=\r\n/discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas=\r\n (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with ka=\r\nrmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi d=\r\netermined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended=\r\n up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part canno=\r\nt be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories =\r\nand conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas et=\r\nc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play dif=\r\nferent roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of t=\r\nhose interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Am n=\r\not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in detai=\r\nls.

When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of =\r\nI-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of o=\r\nne&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you re=\r\nad this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    There is a fine line between the sense=\r\n of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derive=\r\nd through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bod=\r\nies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection impl=\r\nies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all=\r\n other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Individuality of a causal-bodied being=\r\n is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot b=\r\ne the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the =\r\nCausal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas.=\r\n Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act=\r\n upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functionin=\r\ng of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causa=\r\nl forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is i=\r\nndependent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara.=\r\n Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well =\r\nas existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ah=\r\namkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest=\r\n Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that =\r\nparticular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  But ego/ahamkaara/I-nes=\r\ns is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see t=\r\nhrough the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the =\r\nfiner Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of May=\r\na and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entir=\r\ne individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being =\r\nis not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   An Astral=\r\n-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense-consciousness as the very basis of the =\r\nentire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   A Causal-bodied being thin=\r\nks of Chitta/perceptive-consciousness as the very basis of the entire indiv=\r\nidualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   However, that individuality is of the =\r\nSoul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral=\r\n being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are a=\r\nble to work through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneou=\r\nsly (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so o=\r\nn..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say t=\r\nhat this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they inc=\r\narnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal-b=\r\nodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possessi=\r\non) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt =\r\nto possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering =\r\nor conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts o=\r\nf the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Auto=\r\nbiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Causal body is a matrix of 35 =\r\nideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi,=\r\n Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of =\r\nlife-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a w=\r\nhole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a tim=\r\ne, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the correspondi=\r\nng cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping o=\r\nut of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other mo=\r\ndifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is final=\r\nly dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   T=\r\nhus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;   Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Chitta with infin=\r\nitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Buddhi being another=\r\n variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Ev=\r\nen illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from =\r\nAhamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   BTW, Chitta is not the Conditi=\r\noned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incar=\r\nnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inhe=\r\nrent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container c=\r\nontaining an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana=\r\n is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The Samskaras stored by Chitta, includin=\r\ng those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Ta=\r\nmo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot;=\r\n represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiv=\r\ning Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it sto=\r\nres.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impres=\r\nsions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul=\r\n reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus =\r\nrealizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I=\r\nn Patanjali Yoga Sutras:  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -=\r\n6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument =\r\nof seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Since=\r\n astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, sme=\r\nll, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism =\r\ndoes not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karm=\r\na. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciou=\r\nsness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physic=\r\nal Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of s=\r\nense-consciousness, must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read=\r\n autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that =\r\nonly those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the e=\r\nye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pl=\r\neasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Mana=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in =\r\nthe same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   dristanushravika vishaya vitrishna=\r\nsya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   That effect which=\r\n comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen o=\r\nr heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekan=\r\nanda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;   This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to As=\r\ntral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied=\r\n being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    yogashc=\r\nhittavrittinirodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Thus, extinguishing all the movements =\r\nof Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   This is to be accomplis=\r\nhed by transferring the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Ca=\r\nusal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I =\r\nhope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (=\r\nsense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle=\r\n body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and =\r\naffects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or =\r\nconditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sa=\r\nreera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aham=\r\nkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) o=\r\nbserves sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes c=\r\nurrent and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned =\r\nmind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observatio=\r\nns, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permea=\r\ntes through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down the individ=\r\nualized consciousness into various groups by functionality, like five kosha=\r\ns, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, fou=\r\nr antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very=\r\n basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to different people, a jnaa=\r\nna yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination. When =\r\na jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies and koshas are merged in=\r\n cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n"}}
