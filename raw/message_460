Of course \nnot. These are unintelligent and dumb translations at best and ill-motivated \ntranslations with a hideous agenda at worst. In either case, do bot rely on \nthem.\n\nLet me reproduce the rik.\n\nRishi: Angirasa Virupa, Chhandas: Gayatri, Devata: Agni\n\nukShaannaaya vashaannaaya somapR^iShThaaya vedhase | stomairvidhemaagnaye | \nRV 8-43-11 |\n\nThe translation given by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati in the version \npublished by Veda Pratishthana, New Delhi is: &quot;Let us adore with hymns the \nfire-divine, who is fed on agricultural products, dairy products, and who \nbears the herbal plants on the back.&quot;\n\nThis is far more intelligent than what you quoted. However, I am still not \nsatisfied. Let me give my take on it. I just meditated on it for a few \nminutes and this is what I make of it.\n\n*        *        *\n\n(uksha = supreme, large\nanna = matter)\nukshaannaaya = to one who feeds the channel of domination, i.e. pingala nadi\n(vasha = submissive, controlled, obedient\nanna = matter)\nvashaannaaya = to one who feeds the channel of submission, i.e. ida nadi\nsomapR^iShThaaya = to one who carries the nectar of immortality in the \nmiddle channel, i.e. sushumna nadi\nvedhase = to the one who is virtuous and great\nstomaih = by hymns\nvidhema = may we worship/praise/honor/contemplate\nagnaye = to fire.\n\nMEANING: &quot;May we contemplate on the fire god, who feeds the pingala nadi of \ndominance and ida nadi of submission and virtuously carries the nectar of \nimmortality in the sushumna nadi.&quot;\n\nPURPORT: &quot;Fire is the transformative power. It is the basis of our \nexistence. It is what fuels (feeds) every part of our being. The fire that \nburns in the sookshma sareera (subtle body) is called bhoota agni. This fire \nfeeds the pingala nadi (solar channel of the subtle body) and causes \nanalytical and logical abilities and aggressive instincts of domination and \ncontrol. The same bhoota agni also feeds the ida nadi (lunar channel of the \nsubtle body) and causes submission and calmness. In modern medical parlance, \nwe can say the same fire feeds and runs the sympathetic and parasympathetic \nnervous systems and provokes the &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; actions of the push-pull \nnervous system. In addition, the same bhoota agni also drives the sushumna \nnadi and makes the nectar of immortality (sat-chid-ananda) flow in that \nchannel. We should contemplate the various roles played by this subtle fire \nin our subtle body in amazement.&quot;\n\nIf I spend more time, I may be able to do better justice. But this is what I \nunderstand of this rik as of now.\n\n*        *        *\n\nVeda is about self-knowledge and nothing less. Most people cannot understand \neven a single verse of Veda fully in an entire life. Ignore the people who \nclaim to be scholars in Veda and make claims on what Veda says and what Veda \ndoes not say. Secondly, time has come to dump all the abusive and motivated \ntranslations of Veda.\n\nThe only translation/commentary on Veda that pleased me until now is the one \nby Sri Aurobindo. He is undoubtedly a reborn rishi. Such depth and clarity \nof thinking is impossible otherwise.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, September 29, 2008 2:53 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Verse about cow sacrifice\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; I came across a verse in the Rig Veda.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;11 Let us serve Agni with our hymns, Disposer, fed on ox and cow,&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08043.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that mean cow sacrifice was allowed in Vedic times?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly enlighten us on the meaning of this verse.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
