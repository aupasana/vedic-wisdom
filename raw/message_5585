She said, she was intrigued with a wierd, vivid, hypnogog=\r\nic dream,\nshe had had last night.\n\nShe saw herself sitting on the pulpit of=\r\n a grave, in a grave yard, and read the\nfollowing inscribed on the Cross in=\r\n French: EUGENIE ALEXANDRINE, DIED: ON\nSEPTEMBER 8TH 1969. She said that na=\r\nme was very familiar to her, though she had\nnever heard of it. On an impuls=\r\ne I checked Wikipedia, and there was a report on\nAlexandra David-Neel (Euge=\r\nnie Alexandrine)died on September 8th 1969. She is\nreported as a French Wri=\r\nter on Bhuddism, with more than 21 important works to\nher credit.\n\nMy daugh=\r\nter was born on SEPTEMBER 8TH 1979. There is ten years gap, but some\nconnec=\r\ntivity seemed. Now she is a Dentist with Academic distinctions in French\nla=\r\nnguage. She has submitted many research works. She is fond of Budhism to th=\r\ne\nextent of becoming a Budhist Nun. She has no inclination for marriage or\n=\r\nmotherhood. There is exact facial resemblance too. My daughter is very\nspir=\r\nitual, so keen on women&#39;s liberation, philonthropic, worried on social\nwelf=\r\nare of humanity.\n\nBirth Data of Alexandra David-Neel from 10000 Famous Horo=\r\nscopes of JHora.\n\nD.B.
