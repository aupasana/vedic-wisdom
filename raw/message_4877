In some paramparas, specially in North India, it is c=\r\nonsider to be equal to the Saptasati. Where as in eastern India, Bengal/Ass=\r\nam areas, and also some Kaula sampradayas in Varanasi, this is not consider=\r\ned to be equal to Saptasati. \n\nThe reasons why these sampradayas do not con=\r\nsider KS to be equal to Saptasati is the same as what Narasimha stated. \n\n\n=\r\nIn my personal experience, about a year before I actually started reading t=\r\nhe full Saptasati, I used to do the KS for a few months. I was shown a spec=\r\nific method of chanting the KS - there is some breath control required at c=\r\nertain lines etc etc. I had almost mugged it up. But the experience of chan=\r\nting the actual Saptashati (full) is vastly more powerful and different tha=\r\nn the KS. I have serious doubts whether a person doing only the KS can ever=\r\n experience samadhi at all; whereas the Saptasati by itself is capable of b=\r\nestowing the highest and varied types of spiritual experiences to a sadhaka=\r\n. Therefore, I tend to agree with the sampradayas from Bengal and Assam tha=\r\nt the actual Saptasati is anytime more powerful than the KS when it comes t=\r\no spiritual experiences. KS is about siddhis. That too, not a simple straig=\r\nht chanting but with some modulations, breath controls etc etc which have t=\r\no be learnt from someone qualified.\n\nJust my 2 cents on the topic.\n\n-Regard=\r\ns\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shashi_nambisan&quot; &lt;sha=\r\nshin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;    Thanks a lot.

I am afraid it is a coded p=\r\nrayer. It contains hints in coded form for several specific sadhanas to get=\r\n specific results using Devi Saptashati.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; From that point of view,=\r\n one can understand why it says there is no siddhi without Kunjika stotra. =\r\nHowever, one will almost certainly not get siddhi by merely chanting Kunjik=\r\na stotra or adding it to one&#39;s Saptashati chanting. In fact, siddhi often c=\r\nomes to those who do not consciously pursue it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *       =\r\n *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one says &quot;just spending time with your mother and expressin=\r\ng your love and respect for her will not give you her wealth. You need her =\r\ncheckbook to access her wealth&quot;, that is not incorrect. But that is not the=\r\n complete story. Just by having the checkbook of one&#39;s mother, one may not =\r\nbe able to get her wealth. Check needs her signature. On the other hand, a =\r\nsimple child who does not consciously or explicitly try to get the wealth o=\r\nf one&#39;s mother and only spends time with mother expressing love and respect=\r\n from her may end up getting her wealth when she decides by herself to give=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In fact, I suggest not being a son who looks to get mother&#39;s we=\r\nalth by laying hands on her checkbook. Just cultivate love for mother and d=\r\nevote yourself to her. A mother knows what to give and when.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just=\r\n chanting saptashati is quite useful.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textboo=\r\nk,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpa=\r\nna:\n&gt; &gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;        Films=\r\n that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;        Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;     Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- shashi_nambisan &lt;s=\r\nhashin@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I can see that there were some discu=\r\nssion on kunjika stotram before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; however can someone who has expertise=\r\n in sanskrit give exact meaning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of these snippets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These=\r\n are snippets from two slokas in Siddha Kunjika Stotram.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
