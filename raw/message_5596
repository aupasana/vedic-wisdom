Each deity is a personification of s=\r\nome qualities inside us. Different qualities endow us with different kinds =\r\nof shakti (capability to get certain things done).\n \nThese deities or shakt=\r\nis exist in a human-like form too, but subtler forms exist as light or soun=\r\nd. They are basically representations of certain highly desirable qualities=\r\n within us.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHuman like forms where there are mulipl=\r\ne heads, hands etc, carrying specific set of weapons, are symbolic personif=\r\nications. Vishnu has 4 hands, symbloizing the 4 purusharthas - dharma (righ=\r\nteousness), artha (serving purpose), kaama (desires) and moksha (liberation=\r\n). Mahalakshmi, deity of madhyamacharitra of Chandipath, has 18 hands, symb=\r\nolizing the solar/lunar (pingala/ida) variations of the nine planetary ener=\r\ngies. Durga has 10 hands, symbolizing the creatiton of a fort (around one&#39;s=\r\n consciousness) that is fortified and protected from the ten directions. Li=\r\nke this, how many heads and how many hands a deity has and what the deity h=\r\nolds in those hands is symbolic. For example, Vishnu&#39;s Sudarsana chakra cut=\r\ns down anything and makes one see clearly (su-darsana=3Dclear vision). The =\r\nonly clear vision is to see ParaBrahma in all. Any other vision is imperfec=\r\nt vision. In other words, Sudarsana chakra removes confusions and attachmen=\r\nts of the field of duality and gives equanimity and sthitapragyata describe=\r\nd in Gita. Khadga (sword) cuts things in a hand-to-hand combat, i.e. it sho=\r\nws cutting wrong notions by bravely taking them on. Gada (mace) hits hard, =\r\ni.e. it shows suppressing and killing wrong notions by sheer force and inte=\r\nnsity of sadhana. Dhanus and bana (bow and arrow) is released from a distan=\r\nce with good aim, i.e. they show attacking specific wrong notions with pati=\r\nence and good aim. Like this, different weapons are symbolic of different w=\r\nays in which our internal enemies are attacked by the good qualities within=\r\n us (deities).\n \n*        *        *\n \nOf course, this does not mean deitie=\r\ns do not exist in those forms. Though Swami Vivekanansa once famously said =\r\nthat a human being imagines god as a superhuman with many heads and hands, =\r\nwhile a buffalo may imagine god as a super-baffalo with many horns etc, I k=\r\nnow that one can experience deities in human-like forms even though one may=\r\n never actively or passively imagine (or read in books describing) in that =\r\nform in this life. Such notions of deities may be imprinted on the consciou=\r\nsness in this life or even a previous life!\n \nAfter all, though what we exp=\r\nerience around us is a delusion, it is a uniform delusion, i.e. we are all =\r\ncharacters in an elaborate visualization (or dream) of our Creator. So we e=\r\nxperience certain things uniformly. Even if I never create a human-like for=\r\nm of a deity in my mind consciously, my mind may still have access to such =\r\na form!\n \n*        *        *\n \nApart from human-like forms, one can experi=\r\nence deities as light or sound. For example, see the portion that starts wi=\r\nth &quot;I was sleeping oneday&quot; in:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n/message/3481\n \nIn this episode, a deity was experienced as the sound of a =\r\nspecific beejaakshara. One experienced a universe that was filled with that=\r\n sound and with bliss and nothing else. One&#39;s self-awareness was that of a =\r\nsmall particle in that universe. That too was an experience of a deity. Mor=\r\neover, parts of this experience were independently verified by a third part=\r\ny, suggesting that it wasn&#39;t a hallucination.\n \nAfter all, experiences can =\r\nbe hallucinations too. And, it is very easy for a human mind to hallucinate=\r\n. But, hallucinations increase ego and do not cause internal transformation=\r\n, while real experience of divinity causes internal transformation and take=\r\ns one towards Satya.\n \n*        *        *\n \nJust as water takes the shape =\r\nof a container it is poured in, divinity takes forms based on how we are ab=\r\nle to and willing to perceive it and deal with it. You can take water in a =\r\nsmall glass or cup or bowl or jar and keep it in front of you. You can drin=\r\nk it. You can pour it on you. Or you can jump into a pool or lake or river =\r\nor ocean and swim in it. There are many ways to experience and deal with wa=\r\nter. So is the case with divinity!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n   =\r\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;J.&quot; &lt;jkoperumcholan@gmai=\r\nl.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Shri Narasimha.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your way of explaining subtle v=\r\nedic concepts using practical simple examples is excellent.
