Some important thing=\r\ns to ponder over regarding this question:\n\n1. What does it mean to &quot;see&quot; a =\r\ndevata? If one does not see, can one &quot;hear&quot; a Devata, or feel His/Her prese=\r\nnce?\n\n2. Is seeing a Devata similar to seeing another person or a shopping =\r\nmall or a Disney land? If it is same then why can&#39;t we see Devatas whenever=\r\n we wish. If not, what is different?\n\n3. What do you expect to happen if an=\r\nd when you see a Devata? Assuming that it were possible. For example if you=\r\n say want to see/meet Barrack Obama you have a certain expectation in your =\r\nmind about how the interaction will go. Similarly what kind of expectation =\r\nis in the mind about the idea of seeing/meeting a Devata..\n\n4. Krshna was a=\r\n Devata who lived like a Devata in this material plane. We can be sure of t=\r\nhis from the list of miraculous incidents surrounding Him from childhood. H=\r\nis lifting a mountain on a finger, showing the Universe to his mother insid=\r\ne his mouth, displaying his 4 armed forms, using the Sudarshana Chakra to c=\r\nut off the head of Sishupala, causing an eclipse to happen by will, cloning=\r\n Himself into multiple number of exactly same forms such that he could be p=\r\nresent with all the gopis at the same time etcetera. These are things which=\r\n a Devata can do and a human can&#39;t. So people around Him were effectively s=\r\neeing Devata in flesh and blood, in full potency. Did it really cause a mas=\r\nsive spiritual turn in their lives? For some yes, for others no. INfact str=\r\nangely it was the Gopis, whose interaction with Krshna was for the least pe=\r\nriod of time compared to many others - since Krshna could never come back t=\r\no Vrndavana once He left for Mathura - who benefitted\n maximum (spiritually=\r\n speaking) from Him. Then as He spoke the Gita, Krshna showed a Virat Roopa=\r\n - a Universal Form, so infinite that it is impossible to experience proper=\r\nly by the five senses even if they have been made subtle by His blessings -=\r\n to Arjuna who got so scared that he begged the Lord to change the form int=\r\no the one which is easier for him to grasp, 4-armed Vishnu. SO what kind of=\r\n meeting/seeing/darshan is our mind expecting when it comes to a Devata? \n\n=\r\nThe normal/human form - which may or may not benefit a seeker depending on =\r\nthe internal state of the seeker? (It benefitted Gopis, it did not benefit =\r\nmany others)\n\nThe special form - in case of Krshna with four arms holding s=\r\nhankha, chakra, gada etc? This form has benefitted many. Yet, when Krshna a=\r\nppeared in this form to Gopis, they refused to accept Him and asked Him to =\r\ncome back in his form as Krshna. So we cannot say for sure that this kind o=\r\nf a Divine form is sufficient to push a seeker into a high spiritual state.=\r\n\n\nFinally the Universal Form. This cannot be digested by anyone. Irrespecti=\r\nve of Divine Sense or gross senses. No body in the history of spirituality =\r\nhas been able to experience the truly and infinitely Universal Form and sta=\r\ny sane or not feel fear and awe. Not one instance. There was in Bengal a gr=\r\neat sadhaka named Swami Nigamananda Saraswati about 150 years ago. He was a=\r\n disciple of the great Aghori Vamakhepa and by Vama&#39;s blessing he had reali=\r\nzed the Goddess Smashan Tara. One day the disciple insisted that he wanted =\r\nto see the Universal form of the Mother Tara. Vama his guru tried to dissua=\r\nde him. But he was adamant and kept asking the form of Ma Tara that he coul=\r\nd see and interact with, to appear in the Universal form. The next thing he=\r\n saw was just a face, whose fierce blood-dripping fangs encompassed the who=\r\nle sky and covered his entire range of vision. Swami Nigamananda fainted im=\r\nmediately. Mind you, he had by then already acquired great proficiency\n in =\r\nworship of Smashan Tara - the very same Devata whom he requested to appear =\r\nbefore him in a Universal form. Later when he came back to senses, he saw V=\r\nama fanning his head and telling him never to ask Her for the Universal for=\r\nm. It simply CANNOT be digested by anyone! \nBasically this \nmean, to me, th=\r\nat our consciousness CANNOT ever comprehend INFINITY as \nit is. It will alw=\r\nays make an approximation for its own good. Moses \ncould not take the raw L=\r\night of God in the burning bush episode on Mt Sinai. Same thing.\n\nSo is it =\r\nthis form of a Devata that we want to see? Is it even possible to see/hear/=\r\ntouch/experience?\n\nMore importantly, what is the difference between these v=\r\narious seeings? Infact, why are they different in the first place?\n\n5. The =\r\nimportant question to ask would be, IMHO, not whether Devatas can be &quot;seen&quot;=\r\n, but what do we, as seekers, expect to happen IF a Devata chooses to manif=\r\nest Himself/Herself on our consciousness? Unless we are very, very, very ex=\r\nceptional, such that a Devata has pre-decided based on certain karmas and p=\r\nromises from past existences to come and intervene in our lifepath - as it =\r\nhappened with Aghori Vimalananda - and pull our strings, chances are that w=\r\ne may not derive much benefit from a casual meeting with a Devata, just lik=\r\ne so many in the Kurukshetra never derived any benefit from meeting Krshna,=\r\n who was a Devata no doubt.\n\nA Devata has various roopas depending on which=\r\n instrument we are using to percieve Him/Her. The sthoola roopa - gross for=\r\nm (rare but not impossible for a Devata). You need the gross phsyical sense=\r\n to experience this. The sukshma roopa where we need subtle senses to perce=\r\nive the Devata. This is what mostly happens with people who &quot;see&quot; Devatas. =\r\nSuch an interaction can very good, to just another day with nothing special=\r\n. It all depends on how much internal preparation has been done by the seek=\r\ner. As an analogy, you can, if lucky, go and meet Barrack Obama say hi and =\r\ncome back. Nothing much happens. Over time you forget it and life goes on. =\r\nOr you can also meet Obama and then maybe impress him so much that he in tu=\r\nrn does something really nice for you which he is well capable of, which su=\r\nstains long and changes your life. \n\nThen there is the causal form and the =\r\ngreater causal form. These are too rare. To have a &quot;Darshan&quot;/experience of =\r\na Devata in these forms, one will have to do solid work of self-transformat=\r\nion. That is detachment, control of internal enemies, etc etc, the standard=\r\n advices which all scriptures and sadgurus tell us. One experience of any D=\r\nevata in the causal form is sufficient to leave a massive impact on a perso=\r\nn&#39;s life for ever. And the greater causal is mostly offlimits for just abou=\r\nt 99.999999% of us. That is the Universal Form. These are similar to experi=\r\nence of the Self or the soul, as enumerated in the Upanishadic literature. =\r\nNothing less.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nI have a hundred lives before me y=\r\net/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insati=\r\nate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n__________=\r\n______________________\n From: Saurabh Kaushik &lt;skaushik29@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Monday, =\r\n12 August 2013 2:55 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Fw: Spiritual guidance neede=\r\nd!\n \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaskar,=C2=A0I have a very simple & interesting =C2=A0ques=\r\ntion to ask from the respected members on this forum:\n\n\n\nMy question is in =\r\nrespect of vision of god in kaliyuga - is\npossible or not in today&#39;s parlan=\r\nce?\n\nAnd if it is possible so would a person able to see or\nmanifest god=E2=\r\n=80=99s presence through divya chakshu which he can develop through\nright s=\r\nadhna and yog, is it right!\nGoing through different blog over the internet =\r\nand as per my\npersonal belief and understanding what I can conclude that a =\r\nperson should\ndevelop high thinking, he should be free from false ego, =C2=\r\n=A0should be humble in his approach and there\nshould be a significant reduc=\r\ntion of lust, anger and greed within his personality traits, only then he\nf=\r\nulfills the eligibility criteria for having this divine experience=E2=80=A6=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\nOR\nAny person can view God through mantra jap by following certain rituals =\r\nwith or\nwithout developing these qualities.

Unless we are very, very, very exceptional, suc=\r\nh that a Devata has pre-decided based on certain karmas and promises from p=\r\nast existences to come and intervene in our lifepath - as it happened with =\r\nAghori Vimalananda - and pull our strings, chances are that we may not deri=\r\nve much benefit from a casual meeting with a Devata, just like so many in t=\r\nhe Kurukshetra never derived any benefit from meeting Krshna, who was a Dev=\r\nata no\n doubt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Devata has various roopas depending on which instr=\r\nument we are using to percieve Him/Her. The sthoola roopa - gross form (rar=\r\ne but not impossible for a Devata). You need the gross phsyical sense to ex=\r\nperience this. The sukshma roopa where we need subtle senses to perceive th=\r\ne Devata. This is what mostly happens with people who &quot;see&quot; Devatas. Such a=\r\nn interaction can very good, to just another day with nothing special. It a=\r\nll depends on how much internal preparation has been done by the seeker. As=\r\n an analogy, you can, if lucky, go and meet Barrack Obama say hi and come b=\r\nack. Nothing much happens. Over time you forget it and life goes on. Or you=\r\n can also meet Obama and then maybe impress him so much that he in turn doe=\r\ns something really nice for you which he is well capable of, which sustains=\r\n long and changes your life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there is the causal form and the =\r\ngreater causal form. These are too rare. To have a &quot;Darshan&quot;/experience of\n=\r\n a Devata in these forms, one will have to do solid work of self-transforma=\r\ntion. That is detachment, control of internal enemies, etc etc, the standar=\r\nd advices which all scriptures and sadgurus tell us. One experience of any =\r\nDevata in the causal form is sufficient to leave a massive impact on a pers=\r\non&#39;s life for ever. And the greater causal is mostly offlimits for just abo=\r\nut 99.999999% of us. That is the Universal Form. These are similar to exper=\r\nience of the Self or the soul, as enumerated in the Upanishadic literature.=\r\n Nothing less.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv4905100129yui_3_7_2_43_1376280893069_58&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv4905100129yu=\r\ni_3_7_2_43_1376280893069_69&quot;
