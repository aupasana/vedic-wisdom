It&#39;s implementation in =\r\ndaily/business/political life.&quot;\n\nDate: July 10, 2011\n\nTime: 11:00 - 2:00 PM=\r\n (sharp)\n\nPlace - Balu, Deepa, Maya Advani\n\nAddress - 516 West Saddle River=\r\n Road, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458\n\nPhone:  (201) 934 - 9495 or (609) 936-=\r\n0263\n\nADMISSION free GENEROUS DONATIONS WELCOME. Lunch will be served.\n\nDr.=\r\n Swamy will discuss &quot;KRISHAN TV&quot; and he will also discuss &quot;Corruption - Ved=\r\nic Life Style is the solution. It&#39;s implementation in daily/business/politi=\r\ncal life.&quot;\n\nDr. Swamy needs little introduction. He stood for Hindu causes =\r\nand he is recently most well known for his numerous successful legal battle=\r\ns and his well know campaign against corruption.  It is fashionable to spea=\r\nk against corruption now but Dr. Swamy has been fighting this battle alone =\r\nfor longest period of time.\n\n\nWe all know how he saved Rama Sethu. Even tho=\r\nugh he is not a lawyer, he stood like a lion and convinced the judges on th=\r\ne fallacies and discrimination involved in Rama Sethu destruction. It is NO=\r\nT the efforts of any political party, 1 million rallies in Delhi or 0.1 mil=\r\nlion verifiable signature campaigns that succeeded in blocking destruction =\r\nof Rama Sethu, but it is Dr. Swamy&#39;s efforts.\n\nDr. Swamy&#39;s speech for fund =\r\nraising to help correct the bias in Sanatana Dharma Text books is just one =\r\neffort among the many he is dedicating for Sanatan Dharma causes, when poli=\r\nticians shun addressing even the most genuine of Hindu grievances, whether =\r\nit is plight of temples, world wide terrorism, missionary conversions or ap=\r\npeasement politics. Let us take part in this to help ourselves.\n\nThere are =\r\nmany links where you can find the wonderful speeches Dr. Swamy gave on &#39;Hin=\r\ndus Under Siege&#39; and &#39;Rama Sethu&#39; based on his books by the same name.\n\nDr.=\r\n Swamy is widely regarded as an expert on the economy of China. He is also =\r\nwell versed in Mandarin Chinese and is well known for persuading Chinese pr=\r\nemier Deng Xiaoping in 1981 to open Kailash Manasarovar in Tibet to Hindu p=\r\nilgrims in India.\n\nHis official web site is http://janataparty.org where yo=\r\nu can find detailed information of the causes he has undertaken.\nSubramania=\r\nn Swamy is the author of numerous books and writes regularly in various jou=\r\nrnals and newspapers. Some of his books are :-\n\n    Hindutva And National R=\r\nenaissance\n    Rama Setu: Symbol Of National Unity\n    Electronic Voting Ma=\r\nchines : Unconstitutional And Tamperable\n    Economic Growth in China and I=\r\nndia (1989)\n    The Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi: unanswered questions and=\r\n unasked queries (2000)\n    Hindus Under Siege (2006)\n    Corruption and Co=\r\nrporate Governance in India: Satyam, Spectrum, and Sundaram (2009)\n    Econ=\r\nomic Development and Reforms in India and China (2010)\n    Sri Lanka In Cri=\r\nsis: India&#39;s Options\n    Terrorism In India\n    India&#39;S Labour Standards An=\r\nd The Wto Framework\n    Economic Reforms And Performance ; China And India =\r\nIn Comparative Perspective\n    Building A New India: An Agenda For National=\r\n Renaissance\n    Trade And Industry In Japan: A Guide To Indian Entrepreneu=\r\nrs And Businessmen\n    India&#39;s Economic Performance And Reforms: A Perspect=\r\nive For The New Millennium\n    India&#39;s China Perspective\n\nPlease forward to=\r\n as many as possible.\n\nGururbrahmaa gururvishnuh gururdevo Maheswarah |\nGur=\r\nuh-saakshaat parabrahma tasmai shrigurave namah ||\n\nOm,\n\nRajyalaxmi\n\n\n\n"}}
