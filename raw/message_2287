One has to meditate in order to enqui=\r\nre\nabout his self. When I sit for meditation, I go to sleep. What can I do?=\r\n Is\nthere any way out?=94 Bhagavan replied, =93First learn to be awake when=\r\n you are\nin the wakeful state. Then we can think of the sleeping state. We =\r\ndream of\nmany things even when we are awake. We must learn to guard ourselv=\r\nes against\nthem in our waking state. All that we see about us is a dream. W=\r\ne should\nwake up from this dream world.=94\n\nThe questioner said, =93Sadhana=\r\n is required to acquire that carefulness.\nWhenever I decide upon some metho=\r\nd and try to do sadhana, I get sleepy. Will\nBhagavan kindly tell me how to =\r\novercome this sleepiness?=94\n\nBhagavan replied: =93Of the avarana-vikshepas=\r\n (obstructions and disturbances),\nthe first avarana is sleep. We must try a=\r\ns far as possible not to succumb to\nit. We must enquire why we get sleep an=\r\nd regulate our food, movements, etc.\nand see that we do not feel sleepy, bu=\r\nt it is no use trying to stop it when\nonce we are sleepy. Don=92t we get sl=\r\neep if we eat heartily? Then the head\nbegins to nod as we sit for meditatio=\r\nn. It seems some tie their hair to a\nnail in the wall to keep them awake. E=\r\nxcept that they wake up when their\nhead nods, what use is it for dhyana? My=\r\n boyhood experience of sleep is well\nknown. While the school lessons were b=\r\neing taught, lest I should fall\nasleep, I used to tie a thread to the nail =\r\non the wall, and tie my hair to\nit. When the head nods, the thread is pulle=\r\nd tight and that used to wake me\nup. Otherwise, the teacher used to twist m=\r\ny ears and wake me up.=94 So saying,\nBhagavan began to laugh.\n\n=93Is it pos=\r\nsible Bhagavan is concocting all these stories and telling us?=94\nasked Mur=\r\nuganar.\n\n=93No, no! It is true! I used to do all that because I was afraid =\r\nthe teacher\nwould punish me for not listening to his lessons. That was the =\r\nstate in\nthose days.In the early days after my coming here, when I closed m=\r\ny eyes,\ndeeply absorbed in meditation I hardly knew whether it was day or n=\r\night. If\nat any time I opened my eyes I used to wonder whether it was night=\r\n or day. I\nhad no food and no sleep. When there is movement of the body, yo=\r\nu need food.\nIf you have food, you need sleep. If there is no movement, you=\r\n do not need\nsleep. Very little food is enough to sustain life. That used t=\r\no be my\nexperience. Somebody or other used to offer me a tumblerful of some=\r\n liquid\ndiet whenever I opened my eyes. That was all. But one thing: except=\r\n when one\nis in absorbed motionless concentration of mind, it is not possib=\r\nle to give\nup sleep or food altogether. When the body and mind are engaged =\r\nin the\nordinary pursuits of life, the body reels if you give up food and\nsl=\r\neep.Therefore\nit must be said that limitation of food and movement is very =\r\nnecessary for\nthe elevation of the soul.Great people restrict their sleep t=\r\no the barest\nminimum so that they may not waste their time but use it for t=\r\nhe performance\nof selfless good deeds. Some say that it is healthy to go to=\r\n bed at 10 p.m.\nand wake up at 2 a.m. That means that four hours=92 sleep i=\r\ns enough. Some say\nthat four hours=92 sleep is not enough, but that it shou=\r\nld be six hours. It\namounts to this, that sleep and food should not be take=\r\nn in excess. If you\nwant to cut off either of them completely, your mind wi=\r\nll always be directed\ntowards it. Therefore the sadhaka should do everythin=\r\ng in moderation,=94 said\nBhagavan.\n\nThis is what is stated in the Bhagavad =\r\nGita:\n\nYoga is not for him who eats too much, nor who abstains to excess, n=\r\nor who\nis too much addicted to sleep nor even to wakefulness. Yoga kills ou=\r\nt all\npain for him who is regulated in eating and amusement, regulated in\np=\r\nerforming actions, and regulated in sleeping and waking.\n\nSource: Letters f=\r\nrom and Recollections of Sri Ramanasramam Book\n\n-- \nLove And Love Alone\n\nOm=\r\n Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\r\n--0014853198daa5983a04716589c9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;A devotee asked Bhagavan, =\r\n=93Swamiji!
