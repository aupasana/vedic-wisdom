There w=\r\nere other such Sufis too I have heard who were devoted to Krishna.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; That is what Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, =\r\nmen are God, hills are God, Sun, moon and everything is God while We say th=\r\nat everything is of Allah (God).\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Trust Dr Naik whe=\r\nn he is speaking on the Koran. Do not trust him when he speaks on anything =\r\nelse. He does know his Koran well.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Look at this lo=\r\ngically. Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. I=\r\nf that perfected man could not have a directed communion with Allah ever, a=\r\nnd needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermediary,=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A why should any=C3=83=E2=80=9A other muslim ever have a direct con=\r\nnection with Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Actually as far as I know - I maybe wrong - Shait=\r\nan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The entities which live by fire as per Isla=\r\nm are called the Jinns. They are another class who mostly dwell in the smok=\r\ne that comes from fire. They supposedly carry information from earth to the=\r\n heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Ofte=\r\nn muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for different p=\r\nurposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hindu terminologi=\r\nes for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do actually use Jinns =\r\nand work out so called miracles. Maybe they are something like spirits or b=\r\neings of some astral plane. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; However, one who does=\r\n Homa need for a=C3=83=E2=80=9A deity need not worry about these in the lea=\r\nst. When a deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothing else wil=\r\nl dare interfere.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; But the real reason why most mus=\r\nlims have an issue with fire is because in one Hadith it is mentioned proph=\r\net Muhammed disliked fire because it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire to them=\r\n is a symbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs will be thr=\r\nown by Allah into a huge fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; sadly in the view o=\r\nf the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different di=\r\nrections or actually they try to make it such that they never meet.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. In my reading of Islam, Zak=\r\nir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use half truths when it come=\r\ns to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly and wholesomely. The dif=\r\nference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/ =\r\nJainism etc is irreconcileable.=C3=83=E2=80=9A An explanation for this mayb=\r\ne digressing and long.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; But generally, if I were bo=\r\nrn in a muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in a=\r\nnd day out and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as=\r\n the perfected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would c=\r\nonsider Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamental =\r\nthat unless one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there can=\r\nnot be a reconciliation.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb start=\r\ned memorizing the koran for 9 years. At the end of the nine years he starte=\r\nd his temple demolishion campaign.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is no wonder that more =\r\nthan 90 percent of muslim youth, even those highly educated consider Zakir =\r\nNaik to be a gift of Allah to the Ummah and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam=\r\n and &#39;comparitive religions&#39; alive on earth.

As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy=\r\n like in pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of these areas, special=\r\nly Persia, after it was over run by Islam, in order to protect their philos=\r\nophy garbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise they would h=\r\nave faced sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self preservation which =\r\nin turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more sublime pat=\r\nh - IMHO -=C3=83=E2=80=9A than that which comes from the Ahadiths and the K=\r\noran proper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about so=\r\nmething similar to=C3=83=E2=80=9A reincarnation in some of his poems while =\r\nthe following one does talk about communion with God:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I searched for God among the Christians and on the Cross and therei=\r\nn I found Him not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no tr=\r\nace of Him was there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then we=\r\nnt as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With set purpose I fared to=\r\n the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God =\r\nwas not there even.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from i=\r\nbn Sina but found Him not within his range.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I fared then to the scene=\r\n of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation only a &quot;two bo=\r\nw-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there even in that exalted co=\r\nurt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was =\r\nnowhere else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Communion with God is an idea im=\r\npossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always seperate from the =\r\ncreation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eul=\r\nogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that was an att=\r\nempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The person who changed the life of Rumi was also an=\r\nother Sufi called=C3=83=E2=80=9A Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a po=\r\npular legend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead=\r\n. One day the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams=\r\n went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothin=\r\ng happened. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said,=\r\n &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caug=\r\nht him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other tha=\r\nn Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSame was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming A=\r\nnal Haq which literally means I am the Truth.

An honest reading of the Koran a=\r\nnd the hadiths with tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of V=\r\nedanta or any sort of God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digre=\r\nss into my views of what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslam=\r\nic if a true, traditional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern da=\r\ny cities where we find the fashionably spiritual higher middle class.

The entities which live by =\r\nfire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They are another class who mostly d=\r\nwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry information f=\r\nrom earth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult pr=\r\nactitioner use Jinns for different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact=\r\n correspondence to Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I kn=\r\now people who do actually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Maybe =\r\nthey are something like spirits or beings of some astral plane. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, one who does Homa need for a=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A deity need not worry about these in the least.

Fire to the=\r\nm is a symbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs will be th=\r\nrown by Allah into a huge fire.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree =\r\napart in different directions or actually they try to make it such that the=\r\ny never meet.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hmm, I would beg=\r\n to disagree. In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he o=\r\nnly lies and use half truths when it comes to other religion. For Islam he =\r\nquotes correctly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam and non Isla=\r\nmic ideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/ Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A An explanation for this maybe digressing and long.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But generally, if I were born in a muslim=\r\n family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day out and=\r\n trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as the perfected=\r\n man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would consider Zakir =\r\nNaik to be 100 % correct.

Otherwise they would have faced sure shot slaughter. =\r\nThat was a means of self preservation which in turn, over years, helped a l=\r\not of muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=C3=83=E2=80=9A than =\r\nthat which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about somethi=\r\nng similar to=C3=83=E2=80=9A reincarnation in some of his poems while the f=\r\nollowing one does talk about communion with God:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I searched for God among the Christians and o=\r\nn the Cross and therein I found Him not.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I went into the=\r\n ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but Go=\r\nd I found not.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With set purpose I fared to the summit of=\r\n Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God w=\r\nas not there even.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired abou=\r\nt him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI fared then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine man=\r\nifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not ther=\r\ne even in that exalted court.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my =\r\nown heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Communion with God is an idea impossible i=\r\ns the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always seperate from the creation.P=\r\neriod. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muha=\r\nmmed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that was an attempt at di=\r\nsguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The person who changed=\r\n the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=83=E2=80=9A Shams-e-Tabri=\r\nzi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was so powerful =\r\nthat he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and as=\r\nked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of=\r\n Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothi=\r\nng happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke=\r\n up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot inv=\r\noke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same was with case w=\r\nith Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which litera=\r\nlly means I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per tra=\r\nditional Islam. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aul=\r\niya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India. It i=\r\ns said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva for a son=\r\n before Shivaji was born.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Generally, except for the famous=C3=83=E2=80=9A Moinunddin Chisti of =\r\nAjmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis saint. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more s=\r\nubjective interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were=\r\n never fooled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today.=\r\n And I do not blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths wi=\r\nth tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sor=\r\nt of God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views =\r\nof what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, tra=\r\nditional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in =\r\nmodern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual higher middle cla=\r\nss.
