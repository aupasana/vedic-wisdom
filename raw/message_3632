According to them Paramatman, or the Over-Soul, is\nthe witness of the three states of consciousness,--waking, dream and\ndreamless sleep. All these are ideas. The dream state is just as real as the\nwaking state. Let me tell you a story.\n\nParable of the farmer and his only child\n\nThere was a farmer who was a monist; he had attained to some realization. He\nlived like any other farmer with his family, and he had a child. He and his\nwife had extreme love for this son because he was their only child. The\nfarmer himself was a very spiritual man.\n\nHe was respected and loved by everyone in the village. Once he was working\nin the field, when suddenly a man brought the news of his son&#39;s severe\nillness. He went home, called physicians, took great care, but could not\nsave the child&#39;s life.\n\nEverybody in the household was overwhelmed with grief, but the farmer looked\nas if nothing had happened. He consoled others by saying, &quot;What can be\ngained by mourning over the child?&quot; The next day he went to the field as\nusual, and after finishing his work he came home and found his wife and the\nother members of the family still weeping and wailing and plunged in deep\nsorrow.\n\nThe wife reproached him, saying: &quot;How heartless you are! you have not shed a\nsingle tear for your only child.&quot; The farmer then calmly replied: &quot;Shall I\ntell you why I do not weep? Last night I had a wonderful dream.\n\nI saw that I was a king, and the father of eight beautiful children, and\nthat I was enjoying all the pleasures and comforts of life. Suddenly I woke\nup and the dream passed away. Now I am in great confusion,--whether I shall\nweep and wail for my eight children or for this only one.&quot; [p. 93& 94]\n\nThe farmer was an Advaita Jnani, therefore he realized that the waking state\nwas as unreal as the dream state, and that the one permanent Reality was\nAtman. But I accept all states as true,--the state of Samadhi, which is the\nfourth state, and again, the waking, dream and dreamless sleep state. I\naccept Brahman the Absolute and Maya, Jiva (the individual soul) and the\nworld. If I do not take all, a portion will be missing and the weight will\nbe less.\n\nSource: THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--000e0cd13810b4b37d047ec1e4bc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Those who follow monistic (Adva=\r\nita) Vedanta, however, look upon this world as unreal, like a dream.
