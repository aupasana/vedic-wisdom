All spiritual paths, scriptures, teachings an=\r\nd spiritual sadhanas are meant for this only.\n\nVasishtha teaches in Yoga Va=\r\nasishtham that one can read scriptures, contemplate their teachings, spend =\r\ntime in the company of spiritual people and engage in one&#39;s natural activit=\r\nies with dispassion, in order to progress fast.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me quote someth=\r\ning from Ramakrishna. Look at your belongings (spouse, children, job, house=\r\n, cars, wealth, name, fame, and even body) as the property of god. Imagine =\r\nthat you are a temporary caretaker, just as a servant may be living in a ri=\r\nch person&#39;s house as the caretaker as that person stays away. Think of all =\r\nthat is in your hands as the sacred property of your master and take care l=\r\nike a committed servant. A servant takes the best care of his master&#39;s prop=\r\nerty, but does not get attached. Do not be attached anything and yet take t=\r\nhe best possible care. If something goes wrong, do not worry too much and t=\r\nell yourself that the master will take care of it when he gets a chance to =\r\nlook at it. Think for a moment how a servant taking care of the properties =\r\nof a master living away thinks and behaves.\n\nIf one can attain the spirit a=\r\nnd mental state of the servant in this analogy, one&#39;s life will be made.\n\n*=\r\n * *\n\nRead what Manish wrote below:\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you take Time out of the equa=\r\ntion (because a deity has a different time space frame which runs in thousa=\r\nnds of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waiting with patience, =\r\nthen where will God go? God has to come, He can&#39;t escape.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nTake time ou=\r\nt of the equation, i.e. do not put a time limit or say &quot;I have done this sa=\r\ndhana for XYZ years. Why is God not coming?&quot; Wait patiently. After all, if =\r\nyou have truly surrendered, why is it a problem then to wait, let us say, 1=\r\n000 years for Her grace? If you say &quot;I want Her to come in 1 year or 10 yea=\r\nrs and not 1000 years&quot;, that means you have not fully surrendered.\n\n* * *\n\n=\r\n&gt; How to measure it?\n\nOne can measure it by seeing how one is internally re=\r\nacting to challenging circumstances that would earlier provoke lust, anger,=\r\n greed, jealosy etc inside one.\n\nHowever, what will one do by measuring? It=\r\n is not like one can turn a knob based on the measurement to correct it.\n\nI=\r\nn fact, when surrender is completeone you will stop measuring or even think=\r\ning about how to measure it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jy=\r\notishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -\n\n---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana.

Only very advanced sadhakas will be able to identify\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n rnas / karmic debts and know how/where/why they are to be paid off. The re=\r\nst\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of us have to follow dharma, which includes standing up for what i=\r\ns right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and righteous and not being defeatist or fatalistic. Otherwis=\r\ne, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a mass=\r\nive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to take up the dharma of ks=\r\nhatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of karma are too intrica=\r\nte and complex and delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has reached=\r\n certain very very high levels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even then=\r\n, it will only be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Iswar=\r\na/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how to dis=\r\npatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was a great sa=\r\ndhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He did so much sadhana=\r\n of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. This d=\r\neity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of rare op=\r\nportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle, because Shiva=\r\n is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows how to worship Kri=\r\nshna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can you worship Krishn=\r\na perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was beset w=\r\nith doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happened a=\r\ns if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even befor=\r\ne, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila=\r\n or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as=\r\n a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, b=\r\nut the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now o=\r\nnce Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nrishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the battle =\r\nwhen all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person who had been decapitated=\r\n by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive at the top of t=\r\nhe tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory....=\r\n. ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at the beginning of the day he coul=\r\nd see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of the battlefield, then =\r\nhaving done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand a=\r\nt the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being spilt was drunk b=\r\ny Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnat=\r\ne at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ram=\r\nakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left =\r\nmy thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHe said something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think he wa=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing=\r\n to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; freely admi=\r\ntted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fool a=\r\nnd knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wha=\r\ntever you ever do in life, just try and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthat you have with anybody, give whatever you can, turn away nobody from\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; your door, who knows when God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This =\r\ndoes not mean that one is fatalistic and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhat terrific sadhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana an=\r\nd a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cha=\r\n Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being), are essential. Before I met\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas themselv=\r\nes, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, how wil=\r\nl you lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God yourself f=\r\nace to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (beca=\r\nuse a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousands =\r\nof years which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with patience=\r\n, then where will God go?

Tha=\r\nt may not even really be their dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing one&#39;s dharma, as exp=\r\nlained below, is very difficult. As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s dharma=\r\n becomes clearer to one. The sense of dharma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; condition=\r\ned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, even d=\r\noing one&#39;s true dharma does not mean one does not incur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma. If N=\r\nature selects someone, because of one&#39;s prior conditioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debt=\r\ns, to kill thousand bad people, and one fulfils dharma by killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhousand bad people, that person WILL incur new karma for it. Dharma (duty)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (liberation) are two different purusharthas and not one.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfilling dharma is helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to doing dharma, one needs to overcome ego (I-ne=\r\nss) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense of doership goes down, the s=\r\npeed at which new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. Dharma becomes cle=\r\narer. For liberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and the sense of doers=\r\nhip and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) without attachment an=\r\nd doership.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key c=\r\noncepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;http:=\r\n//www.vedicast rologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyoti=\r\nshWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i =\r\nheard that Muslims used to behead meditating sages head when they were\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma is to kill other religious peopl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims attact bad karma or sin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@. ..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogrou=\r\nps. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even I think one has to follow Dharma.

Right action varies from pe=\r\nrson to person, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place.

The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tre=\r\nmendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed =\r\nto a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone =\r\nfor it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma t=\r\no facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were=\r\n on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was differen=\r\nt in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce mat=\r\nerial life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simpl=\r\ne life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life=\r\n of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born agai=\r\nn (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma bas=\r\ned on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;=\r\ns dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words =\r\nsaying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dha=\r\nrma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste=\r\n (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who liv=\r\ned by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. V=\r\nishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became=\r\n a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s=\r\n aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, becau=\r\nse that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops i=\r\nn life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are n=\r\not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individua=\r\nl dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very ver=\r\ny difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma.=\r\n In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us=\r\n what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from =\r\nother parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nnfused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining disc=\r\nrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma an=\r\nd follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best =\r\nwe can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dharm=\r\na, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without i=\r\ndentification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating =\r\nnew karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma =\r\nin the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and=\r\n self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action=\r\n is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We shoul=\r\nd not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; et=\r\nc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unta=\r\nched action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slo=\r\nwly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our =\r\ndharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This w=\r\nill slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it with=\r\nout incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as di=\r\nfficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one=\r\n is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is m=\r\ny dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; li=\r\nttle attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding =\r\none&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anoth=\r\ner external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual mas=\r\nter, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was con=\r\nfused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about h=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a se=\r\ncluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried=\r\n and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and=\r\n do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune =\r\nwith nature and does not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debt=\r\ns are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a cle=\r\nar insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give pe=\r\nrfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is=\r\n that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decla=\r\nre that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fr=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumb=\r\nrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refi=\r\nne one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing inte=\r\nrnal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like ho=\r\nmam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, =\r\none can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long=\r\n as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. =\r\ncom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

The idea is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is not bound by Maayaa=\r\n once one *fully* understands and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of s=\r\nymbolic stories of wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explai=\r\nn how one can fight and overcome various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses that typically =\r\nbind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will =\r\npromote the fighting spirit within one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There=\r\n is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight/overc=\r\nome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nne aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it.=\r\n One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one=\r\n realizes Self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one fina=\r\nlly sees that all these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are aspects of a Single Mother who is also =\r\nessentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series bo=\r\noks by Dr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very m=\r\nixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Perhaps I need to read more!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Aghor=\r\na series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s cu=\r\np of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the n=\r\names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=83? Aghora (aghori) does no=\r\nt see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as imperma=\r\nnent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the m=\r\nind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manif=\r\nestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; wh=\r\nile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name =\r\nof Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea =\r\nis to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary illus=\r\nion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we r=\r\nemind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When=\r\n someone praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and w=\r\ne are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama=\r\n naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary il=\r\nlusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary=\r\n illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are tem=\r\nporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on =\r\ntemporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; =\r\nalways. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (=\r\ninstead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifying them as pure and impur=\r\ne, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction/aversio=\r\nn ) and tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes =\r\nit to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an ill=\r\nusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are bo=\r\nth impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them=\r\n is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So h=\r\ne may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=83? But, please remembe=\r\nr that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the f=\r\nood being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation =\r\nof Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating =\r\nfeces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is d=\r\nwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ea=\r\nting it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain propert=\r\nies and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that=\r\n he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same=\r\n notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, which ess=\r\nentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, su=\r\nch chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be fully absorbed in one=\r\n&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant mani=\r\nfestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;=\r\n, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; per=\r\nmanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. B=\r\nut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure =\r\nresults in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an =\r\nincentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of a per=\r\nson who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consumin=\r\ng Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout fro=\r\nm failing to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. I=\r\nf the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a ladd=\r\nu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mi=\r\nnd fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficu=\r\nlt tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely beca=\r\nuse of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing =\r\na lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness f=\r\nor sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual tho=\r\nughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocki=\r\nng one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming=\r\n such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distrac=\r\nt one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarant=\r\nee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to bite one aft=\r\ner that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some minds may have f=\r\nor sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he=\r\n may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs imp=\r\nure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on=\r\n his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In the beginning, this may titill=\r\nate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana is being made =\r\nimpure. But, suppose he persists to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that for several =\r\nmonths/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. He may no longe=\r\nr feel that he is doing something impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no longer feel tit=\r\nillation. The association in his mind between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nakedness and sex may=\r\n be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally may n=\r\no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation. A=\r\nny small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may=\r\n not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthey may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and th=\r\nrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Ov=\r\nerall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may be gone la=\r\nrgely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nMind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely f=\r\nor sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead =\r\nof thinking of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one =\r\nwas not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83? Bottomline is that a=\r\nn aghora takes problems and weaknesses head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on and sets up a high s=\r\ntakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; push the problem=\r\ns under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a ris=\r\nky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83? Like Manish said in a mail earlier, =\r\n&quot;what is Vedanta and what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical =\r\nway to understand and absorb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by s=\r\netting up a high stakes war plan. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is certainly not suit=\r\nable for all and many may feel aversion. More\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerously, some peo=\r\nple may feel attraction for it based on a wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding and t=\r\nhe thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=83? Aghora stands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for ne=\r\nither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; V=\r\nedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasan=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW,=\r\n the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; path=\r\ns and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; context of aghora.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 361\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?

But what I am trying=\r\n to understand=C3=83? is that how to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worship both forms simultaneou=\r\nsly. For=C3=83? instance, Sri Muththuswamy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Diskshitar, was a great =\r\ncomposer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Music along with Th=\r\nyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vidyopasak=\r\na. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis=C3=83? mention=C3=83? great details abou=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the=C3=83? nine avaranas and different forms of the divine mo=\r\nther as one goes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through each avarana.=C3=83? In the Dhyana Krithi=\r\n=C3=83? of those, in the very=C3=83? first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line he says, &#39;Kamalambi=\r\nke, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=C3=83? That line tells\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me that=C3=\r\n=83? even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.=C3=83?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So my =\r\nquestion was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great on=\r\ne in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; du=\r\nality!

My performing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi homam everyd=\r\nay should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are som=\r\ne people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read C=\r\nhandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nawe-inspiring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nIntegrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; per=\r\nsonal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the time b=\r\netween\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to=\r\n dig 10 metres\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places=\r\n, if one wants to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; One possibility is to do a homam and then meditate a=\r\nt the end after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vid=\r\nya. However, from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is=\r\n a symblic representation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the layers of duality surrounding Self=\r\n. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layer of duality and realize =\r\nSelf.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Lalita me=\r\nans gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have a mothe=\r\nr who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moth=\r\ner who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the strictness).

Plus I sometimes do special rituals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several t=\r\nimes a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; integra=\r\nte these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all ab=\r\nout\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musi=\r\ncian also and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththusw=\r\nami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Nagraj Kota\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1913869391-1267588689=:73453\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimhagaru, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed her divine gra=\r\nce through you that I am able to find answers to many questions that my imm=\r\nature mind keeps on asking! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, coming ba=\r\nck to the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in the first book of=\r\n Aghora are as follows: &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1. On the page 45 it =\r\nsays that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with=\r\n his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this biza=\r\nrre behavior and why should&nbsp;the priest who slapped him&nbsp;die, becau=\r\nse in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least!&nbsp;S=\r\nince you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things,=\r\n I hope&nbsp;to find and answer here. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. In q=\r\nuite a few places, Vimalananda&nbsp;equates changing the&nbsp;loyalty from =\r\ndiety to diety&nbsp;as akin to prostitution, which I find as an extreme vie=\r\nw! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara compose so many hymns in praise=\r\n of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in&nbsp;the praise of Sri Rama, Kr=\r\nishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well.&nbsp;So are so many great comp=\r\nosers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where they wanted t=\r\no see their favorite deity&nbsp;form only (rama&nbsp;in the&nbsp;case of fo=\r\nrmer and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the other form=\r\n is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of Bhaktas=\r\n that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally in the l=\r\nove and awe&nbsp;of every form of god, namely&nbsp;Shiva, rama, krishna, ga=\r\nnesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nNagraj&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;I&gt;&lt;pvr@cha=\r\nrter.net&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQU\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
