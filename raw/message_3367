You correctly ques=\r\ntioned how different\npeople can describe &quot;Nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; differently.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The issue is this. Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being where the=\r\nre\nis no &quot;experiencer&quot;, nothing &quot;to experience&quot; and also no act of\n&quot;experie=\r\nncing&quot;. In other words, there is no observer (subject), observed\n(object) a=\r\nnd observing (action). All merge into one.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; When I-ness (the sense t=\r\nhat &quot;this is I. There are others.

If there i=\r\ns no objectification, how can\nthere be any experience or observation? If th=\r\nere is no observation and\nexperience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa samad=\r\nhi?\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Bottomline is that there is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa s=\r\namadhi.\nRegarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: &quot;When I am in=\r\n\nNirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about\nthe=\r\n &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the observation of an\nI-nes=\r\ns as it is being torn down or being reconstructed, i.e. just before\nor afte=\r\nr Nirvikalpa samadhi but not *during* it.&quot;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; This is essentially the =\r\nproblem with &quot;describing&quot; Nirvikalpa samadhi!\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; In terms of the diamond an=\r\nalogy quoted by Kishore, what different\nyogis are saying about the &quot;experie=\r\nnce&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi says more\nabout the path they are taking into th=\r\ne inside of the diamond, rather\nthan describing the inside of the diamond i=\r\ntself. One may think &quot;nothing\nreally exists apart from Brahman - all this I=\r\n am perceiving is a\ndelusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive is actuall=\r\ny Brahman&quot;.\nAnother may think &quot;all that I perceive is actually a minute par=\r\nt of\nKrishna&quot;. And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness on a specific\nth=\r\nought and everything else disappears from the mind, one is in samadhi.\nOnce=\r\n that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvikalpa samadhi. However,\none ca=\r\nn only describe the last thought on which I-ness was focused prior\nto Nirvi=\r\nkalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa samadhi itself.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Some yogis pre=\r\nfer the stage just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a\ntrace of I-ness is lef=\r\nt in an intense focus on one thought, to\nNirvikalpa samadhi itself. In the =\r\nformer, there is an experience and\nbliss - some rasa (juice). In the latter=\r\n, there is no experience.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Buddha is a great jnaani and his statement i=\r\ns perfect. However, one\nwho is not at Buddha&#39;s wavelength can easily misund=\r\nerstand it. If an\nobserver exists and observes &quot;void&quot;, that is different. W=\r\nhat we are\ntalking about here is the absence of observer, i.e. merging of o=\r\nbserver,\nobserved and the act of observing into one, without ANY distinctio=\r\nn\nwhatsoever between them. Is &quot;void&quot; the right word to describe that state\n=\r\nor is &quot;everything&quot; the right word? Is there a good way to describe it?\nProb=\r\nlem is that the word &quot;void&quot; may make people imagine a scenario where\nthere =\r\nis an observer, but a void to observe.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2  =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2 =C2 =C2  http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  Films that make a difference:\nhttp://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n&gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  Spirituality:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; --- On Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@... wrote:\n&gt; From:=\r\n rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi\n&gt; To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, December 29, 2009, 1:27 PM\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I understand the exa=\r\nmple given in that superb mail, yet some confusion\nexist (in my understandi=\r\nng) .\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; See, Sri Ramakrishna, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Sama=\r\ndhi said\nhe cannot describe it in words like the salt doll example provided=\r\n by\nHari.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadan=\r\nti&quot;, which\nmeans\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot; .\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; True. Now I see this line in different ways - 1) As different saints\n=\r\nhave mentioned different sadhanas/paths to achieve God. 2) Secondly as\nyou =\r\nmentioned, that Truth is One, but saints call it differently.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; From=\r\n=C2 from the diamond analogy I understand that if=C2 X reaches a\ncertain fa=\r\nce of the diamond and Y reaches another face of the diamond,\nthey percieve =\r\nit differently, thought both faces are the same diamond,\njust different asp=\r\nects. This is OK. This can be equal to savikalpa\nsamadhi and may be experie=\r\nnced differently depending upon the\nindividual.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Now\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; As yo=\r\nu break through any face of the diamond\n&gt; &gt; and jump into the interior of t=\r\nhe diamond, you no longer perceive\nthe faces=C2\n&gt; &gt; of the diamond or the w=\r\norld outside.

Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2  the same? I thought, which=\r\never face of teh\ndiamond you chose as your entry point, the middle of teh d=\r\niamond should\nfeel and look exactly similar. Please correct me if I am wron=\r\ng in my\nunderstanding.=C2 =C2 And yet these three spiritual gaints have spo=\r\nken\ndifferently of their realizations.

Then I wonder why these three pe=\r\nople - saints of highest order\n- try to describe it when all descriptions a=\r\nre from within duality...\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Considering the above, I understand the w=\r\nisdom (theoritically) of why\nRamakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalpa Sam=\r\nadhi.=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I also wonder whether=C2 the three saints, Sri Ramana Maha=\r\nrishi, Sri\nAurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking from teh same realizatio=\r\nn of=C2\nthe One/Truth, or was it different kinds of realizations.

I can observe them&quot;) disappears, what is the basis for any obje=\r\nctification in the Supreme Cosmic Essence? If there is no objectification, =\r\nhow can there be any experience or observation? If there is no observation =\r\nand experience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa samadhi?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Bottomline is that there is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa samad=\r\nhi. Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: &quot;When I am in Nir=\r\nvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about the &quot;ex=\r\nperience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the observation of an I-ness as=\r\n it is being torn down or being reconstructed, i.e. just before or after Ni=\r\nrvikalpa samadhi but not *during* it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is es=\r\nsentially the problem with &quot;describing&quot; Nirvikalpa samadhi!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In terms of the diamond analogy quoted by Kishore, what =\r\ndifferent yogis are saying about the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi say=\r\ns more about the path they are taking into the inside of the diamond, rathe=\r\nr than describing the inside of the diamond itself. One may think &quot;nothing =\r\nreally exists apart from Brahman - all this I am perceiving is a delusion&quot;.=\r\n Another may think &quot;all I perceive is actually Brahman&quot;. Another may think =\r\n&quot;all that I perceive is actually a minute part of Krishna&quot;. And so on. Once=\r\n one is able to focus I-ness on a specific thought and everything else disa=\r\nppears from the mind, one is in samadhi. Once that I-ness also disappears, =\r\none is in Nirvikalpa samadhi. However, one can only describe the last thoug=\r\nht on which I-ness was focused prior to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirv=\r\nikalpa samadhi itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some yogis prefer the stag=\r\ne just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a trace of I-ness is left in an inte=\r\nnse focus on one thought, to Nirvikalpa samadhi itself. In the former, ther=\r\ne is an experience and bliss - some rasa (juice). In the latter, there is n=\r\no experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbs=\r\np;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp=\r\n;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Buddha is a great jnaani an=\r\nd his statement is perfect. However, one who is not at Buddha&#39;s wavelength =\r\ncan easily misunderstand it. If an observer exists and observes &quot;void&quot;, tha=\r\nt is different. What we are talking about here is the absence of observer, =\r\ni.e. merging of observer, observed and the act of observing into one, witho=\r\nut ANY distinction whatsoever between them. Is &quot;void&quot; the right word to des=\r\ncribe that state or is &quot;everything&quot; the right word? Is there a good way to =\r\ndescribe it? Problem is that the word &quot;void&quot; may make people imagine a scen=\r\nario where there is an observer, but a void to observe.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2=\r\n&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nb=\r\nsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp=\r\n;=C2&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@=\r\n... wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Da=\r\nte: Tuesday, December 29, 2009, 1:27 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I understand the example given in that superb mail, yet=\r\n some confusion exist (in my understanding) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; See=\r\n, Sri Ramakrishna, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Samadhi said he canno=\r\nt describe it in words like the salt doll example provided by Hari. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa =\r\nvadanti&quot;, which means&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call diff=\r\nerently&quot; . &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; True. Now I see this line in differen=\r\nt ways - 1) As different saints have mentioned different sadhanas/paths to =\r\nachieve God. 2) Secondly as you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints ca=\r\nll it differently.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From=C2&nbsp;from the diamond =\r\nanalogy I understand that if=C2&nbsp;X reaches a certain face of the diamon=\r\nd and Y reaches another face of the diamond, they percieve it differently, =\r\nthought both faces are the same diamond, just different aspects. This is OK=\r\n. This can be equal to savikalpa samadhi and may be experienced differently=\r\n depending upon the individual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As you break through any face of the diamond&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n and jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the face=\r\ns=C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the diamond or the world outside. There are no =\r\nlonger any objects or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attributes.=C2&nbsp; There is no I-ness=\r\n or It-ness or experience. The experiencer, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experienced and e=\r\nxperience all merge into one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) This seems logic=\r\nal and is also the main cause of my confusion. When=C2&nbsp;we say that we =\r\nenter the middle of the diamond, when duality is no more, then how can it=\r\n=C2&nbsp;be experienced differently by different people? Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2=\r\n&nbsp; the same? I thought, whichever face of teh diamond you chose as your=\r\n entry point, the middle of teh diamond should feel and look exactly simila=\r\nr. Please correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;An=\r\nd yet these three spiritual gaints have spoken differently of their realiza=\r\ntions. If duality itself does not exist, then how can the field of possibli=\r\nty at all arise? Which means, how can there be a difference in the &quot;percept=\r\nion&quot; of the same One final Truth?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Not to menti=\r\non the query about whether, that which is transcendental in its basic natur=\r\ne (Truth/One/Middle of the diamond),=C2&nbsp;can=C2&nbsp;at all be=C2&nbsp;=\r\ndescribed from within the field of duality? Then I wonder why these three p=\r\neople - saints of highest order - try to describe it when all descriptions =\r\nare from within duality...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Considering the above,=\r\n I understand the wisdom (theoritically) of why Ramakrishna refused to desc=\r\nribe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I also wonder w=\r\nhether=C2&nbsp;the three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri Aurobindo and Lo=\r\nrd Buddha were speaking from teh same realization of=C2&nbsp;the One/Truth,=\r\n or was it different kinds of realizations. By this I mean, can it be possi=\r\nble that there are different intermediate or not properly documented stages=\r\n of samadhi apart from the standard=C2&nbsp;savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS: I can understand that maybe Buddha did not men=\r\ntion a void per se, he probably mentioned that there is nothing - for lack =\r\nof any better words -=C2&nbsp;and stopped further discussion.
