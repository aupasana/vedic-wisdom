I was actual=\r\nly \nfascinated by the &#39;Kriya Yoga&#39; mentioned in the book and there arose \na=\r\n deep desire to learn this Kriya yoga. I came to reading the \nchapter on &#39;B=\r\nabaji&#39; in the same book. In the very chapter, Yogananda \nhas mentioned that=\r\n Babaji is living since many centuries and he is \nstill present in physical=\r\n form. Anybody who sincerely asks for \nspiritual help, he/she will be helpe=\r\nd by Babaji even today. Reading \nthe above, I instantly close my eyes and d=\r\neeply prayed Babaji. I \nprayed that if you are still there guiding spiritua=\r\nl people then \nplease help me for learning this Kriya yoga.\nAnd to my pleas=\r\nant surprise, within a month I was introduced \n(accidentally/ unplanned way=\r\n) to Sudarshan Kriya Yoga of Art of \nLiving organization by Sri Sri Ravisha=\r\nnkar. Few more such inner \nexperiences happened which convinced me that Bab=\r\naji is there and \ngave me enough faith in Yogananda and Sri Sri Ravi Shanka=\r\nr&#39;s \ngreatness as real yogis.\n\nMy strong opinion is that if one goes by med=\r\nia (Print or electronic \nor internet), there are all the chances that most =\r\npeople will be \nconfused and would not be able to decide about somebody&#39;s c=\r\nharacter \nor caliber. Even Swami Vivekananda in his time was accused for ma=\r\nny \nwrong practices in USA and U.K. hence personally, I rely upon my own \nh=\r\neart and own experiences. I always stay far away from Print as well \nas TV =\r\nreports. Big NO NO. to News channels. Most of them are \nspreading nonsense.=\r\n They have become script writer rather than \nauthentic news providers. Even=\r\n, random and reckless opinions of \npeople in general is many a times misgui=\r\nding/confusin g.\n\nSame way, for my Beloved Thakur, I relied on the same way=\r\ns. After I \nread Gospel, I was drawn in to events which ultimately took me =\r\nto My \nGuru of this life (It took 4 years). And it can not be a coincidence=\r\n \nthat my Guru is also very very much attached to Thakur Ramkrsihna. I \nrat=\r\ne Ramkrsihna Kathamruta as the Best `darkness dispelling&#39; book I \nread till=\r\n date and now spiritual books also doesn&#39;t interest me \nmuch. Enough of rea=\r\nding, now it&#39;s high time for *Doing*. \n\nHence my input to all those serious=\r\n spiritualist, who are also \nseriously confused&#61516; , that listen to yo=\r\nu heart, Pray for the clarity, \nMeditate, keep doing Sadhanas and observe t=\r\nhe chain of events \nhappening around you. Those are the best ways to get th=\r\ne clarity \nabout any spiritual person or future spiritual Guru rather than =\r\n\ndepending, more than required, upon Media and such external inputs \nwho ha=\r\nve hardly any sincere spiritual interest.\n\nI clarify here that I am an almo=\r\nst a novice who is struggling in the \npath of spirituality but still felt t=\r\nhat my own inputs out of \nexperience may help few.\n\nSpiritually yours,\nUtpa=\r\nl \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Lakshmi Kary &lt;lakshmikary@ ...&gt; =\r\n\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hare Rama Krishna\n&gt; Dear Narasimha.\n&gt; Sorry I got my people and=\r\n lineages all confused! Was reading \nabout too many people lately.\n&gt; \n&gt; Als=\r\no last night I saw a documentary on religious leaders, \ncults etc.\n&gt; People=\r\n want to see God so badly they are very eager to push \nanyone who is willin=\r\ng to claim to be special up on a pedestal.That \nhappened with my ex , he go=\r\nt up there,felt it wasn&#39;t right and tried \nto climb down, but his&quot;disciples=\r\n&quot; didn&#39;t want him to.\n&gt; They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his p=\r\nurity, and \nall sorts of cover ups.\n&gt; God and Jesus are living in some many=\r\n places. Sometimes there \nare several people simultaneously claiming to be =\r\nJesus in any psych \nunit across the world/\n&gt; Its amazing where and to withi=\r\nn whom people see &quot;God&quot;.\n&gt; Isnt a spiritual master, guru, living like a mor=\r\ntal in all \ncapacities while telling others how to find realization sort of=\r\n \nhypocritical and bizarre?\n&gt; \n&gt; There is one fellow who used to be a heroi=\r\nn addict and now he \nsays he is Jesus and has a huge following. they are wi=\r\nlling to do \nwhatever he says and they give him money and all sorts of thin=\r\ngs.\n&gt; Yesterday I went on the Internet, and looked at some many so \ncalled =\r\nyogis, preachers etc\n&gt; IN the USA I cant begin to tell you the number of re=\r\nligious \nleaders that were revered as &quot;God&quot; or some other incarnation.\n&gt; In=\r\ndia is no different, perhaps worse because people have a \nnatural respect f=\r\nor sadhus , yogis etc and more yogis can get away \nwith pretending to be a =\r\nrenunciate.\n&gt; I believe God appears in different forms in different places =\r\nand \ntimes to attract people who are looking for him and to associate \nwith=\r\n his devotees..\n&gt; Now that Documentary TV program and your posts got my min=\r\nd \nswimming.\n&gt; What are principles of religion? What is dharma, What is the=\r\n \npurpose?\n&gt; Now if there were no laws or rules, social or religious and \ne=\r\nveryone did what they felt like, we would be living in a hell. At \nleast in=\r\n Kali Yuga.\n&gt; What was the point of Jesus?

Maybe they have j=\r\nust accumulated \nthe power to manipulate physical matter.\n&gt; Unless a person=\r\n is pure- it is hard to see who else is pure.\n&gt; And even then, well intenti=\r\noned people are deceived all the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; People have given up everything=\r\n they owned and moved into under \nground tunnels because their leader( an i=\r\nncarnation of this or that) \nsaid the world was ending.\n&gt; Or, time and time=\r\n again, some swami turns out to molest kids, \nand or do all sorts of things=\r\n when no one is looking..\n&gt; &quot;The Do as I say , don&#39;t do as I do&quot;...\n&gt; &quot;He i=\r\ns so pure he doesn&#39;t have to obey the rules like everyone \nelse.&quot;\n&gt; Whose t=\r\no say who is pure?\n&gt; I think someone who is 100% serving their GOD day and =\r\nnight, at \nall times and practicing what they preach has got to be pure....=\r\n\n&gt; Self realization after much thought and years \nmeditating/chanting is si=\r\nmple i found... its the realization ,the \ncomplete understanding of our rel=\r\nationship to God and to everything \nand everyone else in our conscious and =\r\nunconscious universe.\n&gt; But then by the time I die , I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have eve=\r\nn more \nrealizations.\n&gt; There was a big article in TIME magazine with some =\r\npersonal \nletter of Mother Theresa that she didnt want shown publically tha=\r\nt \nshowed her apparently having doubts(privately in her heart) I guess \nas =\r\na way to try and discredit her.\n&gt; Was she a saint, coming to India and push=\r\ning her views on the \npoor?People go in circles debating her worth .\n&gt; And =\r\nI guess these are the things I&#39;m here for in this life, \nwhich is different=\r\n than other peoples path.\n&gt; I keep hoping astrology can &quot;reveal&quot; the real s=\r\naint the real \nsadhus..etc\n&gt; Suffering helps one think about these things.\n=\r\n&gt; Best wishes\n&gt; Lakshmi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Bu=\r\nt Ramakrishna \nParamahamsa stands out in one way. He is one master who mast=\r\nered \nevery single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga \n=\r\nand even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, \nKaali an=\r\nd several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikalpa \nsamadhi, where th=\r\nere is no &quot;experience&quot; . He was in sahaja samadhi \nalways. He was able indu=\r\nce tremendous experience in people by mere \ntouch or mere look. Yet he was =\r\nsimple like a child and had zero ego \n(that is why he could do all that!!!)=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on their sishyas and have no \nabilit=\r\ny to recognize the true nature and dharma of each sishya. They \nforce sishy=\r\nas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the form they \nworship and walk =\r\nthe path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight \ninto the true nature of e=\r\nach sishya and gave specific instructions. \nHe taught totally different man=\r\ntras, totally different forms and \ntotally different paths to different sis=\r\nhyas. He even taught \ncontradictory things to different sishyas. When one s=\r\nishya who \nneeded to mend his aggressive attitude roughed up somebody for \n=\r\ninsulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With your attitude, \nyou did =\r\nnot defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You should \nlearn to be cal=\r\nm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru \nin a good stead and n=\r\not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who \nneeded to mend his soft demea=\r\nnor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by \nsome people and came away silently, =\r\nhe scolded him &quot;shame on you.\n&gt; Shastras say that you should kill one who i=\r\nnsults your guru. How \ncan you ignore such wrong behavior? You should give =\r\nthem a piece of \nyour mind.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritual sadhana does not mean just chan=\r\nting a mantra or \nrepeating a procedure everyday for a certain period of ti=\r\nme. \nSpiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one transforms \none=\r\nself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every action \nand ever=\r\ny thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for \nintrospection an=\r\nd transformation of internal attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, coming back to the poin=\r\nt, Ramakrishna is not a normal \nsadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a =\r\nvery special class of \nsadhakas and he was an exceptional guru to an except=\r\nional group of \nsishyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be =\r\na nobody and would \nbe lower than dirt.

Right action varies from p=\r\nerson to person, from time \nto time \n&gt; and from place to place.

If, based on \none&#39;s mental \n&gt; te=\r\nndencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \nmessage of =\r\n\n&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based \non on=\r\ne&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to \nspread=\r\n the \n&gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.

The time then was such that there was too \nmuc=\r\nh weight \n&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight.=\r\n \nTremendous \n&gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to=\r\n a \ngreat extent, \n&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna b=\r\neing a great \nwarrior, \n&gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people=\r\n he deeply loved \nand \n&gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dh=\r\narma to kill \nthem.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th ce=\r\nntury as one of \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had =\r\nbeen \nArjuna in a \n&gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma =\r\nwas \ndifferent in this \n&gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce mater=\r\nial life despite \nhis \n&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life o=\r\nf a monk and \ninspire \n&gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental det=\r\nachment and \nservice to \n&gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, =\r\nas per what \nRamakrishna \n&gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place m=\r\nay be something \nelse.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The tricky question is: How does one=\r\n decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s w=\r\nords saying &quot;follow your \nown dharma \n&gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in t=\r\nhe light of castism. Though the \nconcept \n&gt; of caste (varna) has been there=\r\n in Hinduism for a long time, the \nconcept of \n&gt; caste mobility was very mu=\r\nch there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived \nby \n&gt; killing birds. He became a =\r\nbrahmana and a maharshi later. \nVishwamitra was a \n&gt; kshatrita and a powerf=\r\nul king. He became a brahmana and and a \nmaharshi \n&gt; later. Basically varna=\r\n shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with \nthe varna \n&gt; of father, because=\r\n that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As \none \n&gt; develops in life, =\r\none gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the misinterpre=\r\ntation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to \nknow your \n&gt; dharma from your=\r\n caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 \ndharmas in \n&gt; the world. E=\r\nach person has individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very=\r\n very very difficult. If one \nis pure \n&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma. In fact, all of us have a \npart of our \n&gt; mind that tells us what our d=\r\nharma is, but it is surrounded by a \nlot of \n&gt; noise from other parts of ou=\r\nr minds which tell other things. Thus, \nwe get \n&gt; confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; We should =\r\nmake the best judgment combining discrimination and \nintuition and \n&gt; decid=\r\ne what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, \nbut doing \n&gt; =\r\nthe best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; \n&gt; More than following dharma, wha=\r\nt is of utmost importance is to \nengage in \n&gt; actions without identificatio=\r\nn. *That* alone ensures that we are \nnot \n&gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. n=\r\not increasing the load. We should \nnot build \n&gt; too much attachment to what=\r\n we are doing. We should engage in the \nbest \n&gt; possible actions (based on =\r\nour best judgment on what our dharma in \nthe given \n&gt; situation is), with a=\r\ns little attachment and self-identification \nwith the \n&gt; action as possible=\r\n. When the action is finished, we should leave \nthe result \n&gt; to god. We sh=\r\nould not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen \nnow&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; work&quot; etc. =\r\nSuch adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication \nthrough \n&gt; untached acti=\r\non) will simplify our ego and purify our \nconsciousness slowly. \n&gt; As we be=\r\ncome purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma \nclearer. \n&gt; The=\r\nre is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to \nsee our \n&gt; d=\r\nharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is \nnot easy=\r\n, \n&gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline is: Even if =\r\none is not following one&#39;s dharma, \none&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; g=\r\nets refined with time if one engages in \naction with \n&gt; little attachment.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are=\r\n the \ninputs. \n&gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and lear=\r\nned men. \nOne can \n&gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is give=\r\nn to one&#39;s \nspiritual \n&gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, o=\r\nne can take the \nwords of \n&gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follo=\r\nw it sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and=\r\n thought \nkilling gurus \n&gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in K=\r\nrishna who \nclarified his \n&gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) =\r\nwas confused about \nhis dharma \n&gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go t=\r\no a secluded place to do \nsadhana, \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and pre=\r\nvailed upon him to stay in \nthe material \n&gt; world and do the work of Mother=\r\n for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one=\r\n is, \nwhat one&#39;s \n&gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in t=\r\nhe judgment \nof what \n&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul =\r\nwith a clear \ninsight into \n&gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfec=\r\nt guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outlin=\r\ne a set of \nprinciples and \n&gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma change=\r\ns from person to \nperson, from \n&gt; time to time and from place to place. Als=\r\no, there are no \nthumbrules to find \n&gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one c=\r\nan refine one&#39;s understanding \nof one&#39;s \n&gt; dharma by increasing internal pu=\r\nrity. By doing various kinds of \nspiritual \n&gt; sadhana (like homam, japam et=\r\nc) and engaging in actions without \nmuch \n&gt; attachment, one can slowly puri=\r\nfy oneself and refine one&#39;s \nunderstanding of \n&gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----=\r\n- \n&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i just finished my Aghora=\r\n series\n&gt; &gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is ver=\r\ny personal.\n&gt; &gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; jitender\n&gt;\n\n \n\n\n      We have the leading experts share adv=\r\nice, tips, and personal experiences here - http://nz.lifestyle.yahoo.com/he=\r\nalth/\r\n--0-2124676834-1222682194=:54160\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size=\r\n:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hare Rama Krishna&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Resp=\r\nected Utpalji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskar.

I was actually &lt;BR&gt;fascinated by the &#39;Kriya Yoga&#39; mentioned in the =\r\nbook and there arose &lt;BR&gt;a deep desire to learn this Kriya yoga. I came to =\r\nreading the &lt;BR&gt;chapter on &#39;Babaji&#39; in the same book. In the very chapter, =\r\nYogananda &lt;BR&gt;has mentioned that Babaji is living since many centuries and =\r\nhe is &lt;BR&gt;still present in physical form. Anybody who sincerely asks for &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;spiritual help, he/she will be helped by Babaji even today. Reading &lt;BR&gt;t=\r\nhe above, I instantly close my eyes and deeply prayed Babaji. I &lt;BR&gt;prayed =\r\nthat if you are still there guiding spiritual people then &lt;BR&gt;please help m=\r\ne for learning this Kriya yoga.&lt;BR&gt;And to my pleasant surprise, within a mo=\r\nnth I was introduced\n &lt;BR&gt;(accidentally/ unplanned way) to Sudarshan Kriya =\r\nYoga of Art of &lt;BR&gt;Living organization by Sri Sri Ravishankar. Few more suc=\r\nh inner &lt;BR&gt;experiences happened which convinced me that Babaji is there an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;gave me enough faith in Yogananda and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;grea=\r\ntness as real yogis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My strong opinion is that if one goes by media =\r\n(Print or electronic &lt;BR&gt;or internet), there are all the chances that most =\r\npeople will be &lt;BR&gt;confused and would not be able to decide about somebody&#39;=\r\ns character &lt;BR&gt;or caliber. Even Swami Vivekananda in his time was accused =\r\nfor many &lt;BR&gt;wrong practices in USA and U.K. hence personally, I rely upon =\r\nmy own &lt;BR&gt;heart and own experiences. I always stay far away from Print as =\r\nwell &lt;BR&gt;as TV reports. Big NO NO. to News channels. Most of them are &lt;BR&gt;s=\r\npreading nonsense. They have become script writer rather than &lt;BR&gt;authentic=\r\n news providers. Even, random and reckless opinions of &lt;BR&gt;people in genera=\r\nl is many a\n times misguiding/confusin g.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Same way, for my Beloved T=\r\nhakur, I relied on the same ways. After I &lt;BR&gt;read Gospel, I was drawn in t=\r\no events which ultimately took me to My &lt;BR&gt;Guru of this life (It took 4 ye=\r\nars). And it can not be a coincidence &lt;BR&gt;that my Guru is also very very mu=\r\nch attached to Thakur Ramkrsihna. I &lt;BR&gt;rate Ramkrsihna Kathamruta as the B=\r\nest `darkness dispelling&#39; book I &lt;BR&gt;read till date and now spiritual books=\r\n also doesn&#39;t interest me &lt;BR&gt;much. Enough of reading, now it&#39;s high time f=\r\nor *Doing*. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hence my input to all those serious spiritualist, who a=\r\nre also &lt;BR&gt;seriously confused&amp;#61516; , that listen to you heart, Pray=\r\n for the clarity, &lt;BR&gt;Meditate, keep doing Sadhanas and observe the chain o=\r\nf events &lt;BR&gt;happening around you. Those are the best ways to get the clari=\r\nty &lt;BR&gt;about any spiritual person or future spiritual Guru rather than &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ndepending, more than required, upon Media and such external inputs &lt;BR&gt;who =\r\nhave\n hardly any sincere spiritual interest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I clarify here that I a=\r\nm an almost a novice who is struggling in the &lt;BR&gt;path of spirituality but =\r\nstill felt that my own inputs out of &lt;BR&gt;experience may help few.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sp=\r\niritually yours,&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40y=\r\nahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisd=\r\nom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Lakshmi Kary &lt;=\r\nlakshmikary@ ...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hare Rama Krishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; D=\r\near Narasimha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sorry I got my people and lineages all confused!

But Ramakri=\r\nshna &lt;BR&gt;Paramahamsa stands out in one way. He is one master who mastered &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;every single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nand even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Rama, Krishna, &lt;BR&gt;Kaali=\r\n and several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikalpa &lt;BR&gt;samadhi, wh=\r\nere there is no &quot;experience&quot; . He was in sahaja samadhi &lt;BR&gt;always. He was =\r\nable induce tremendous experience in people by mere &lt;BR&gt;touch or mere look.=\r\n Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego &lt;BR&gt;(that is why he could =\r\ndo all that!!!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Many &quot;gurus&quot;\n force their dharma on their=\r\n sishyas and have no &lt;BR&gt;ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of=\r\n each sishya. They &lt;BR&gt;force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worshi=\r\np the form they &lt;BR&gt;worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had de=\r\nep insight &lt;BR&gt;into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instru=\r\nctions. &lt;BR&gt;He taught totally different mantras, totally different forms an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;totally different paths to different sishyas. He even taught &lt;BR&gt;cont=\r\nradictory things to different sishyas. When one sishya who &lt;BR&gt;needed to me=\r\nnd his aggressive attitude roughed up somebody for &lt;BR&gt;insulting his guru, =\r\nhe scolded &quot;shame on you. With your attitude, &lt;BR&gt;you did not defend your g=\r\nuru, but brought shame to him. You should &lt;BR&gt;learn to be calm and ignore s=\r\nuch insults. THAT will place your guru &lt;BR&gt;in a good stead and not your agg=\r\nression&quot;. When another sishya who &lt;BR&gt;needed to mend his soft demeanor igno=\r\nred insults of Ramakrishna by &lt;BR&gt;some\n people and came away silently, he s=\r\ncolded him &quot;shame on you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shastras say that you should kill one who=\r\n insults your guru. How &lt;BR&gt;can you ignore such wrong behavior? You should =\r\ngive them a piece of &lt;BR&gt;your mind.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spiritual sadhana doe=\r\ns not mean just chanting a mantra or &lt;BR&gt;repeating a procedure everyday for=\r\n a certain period of time. &lt;BR&gt;Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by=\r\n which one transforms &lt;BR&gt;oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. Tha=\r\nt way, every action &lt;BR&gt;and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an o=\r\npportunity for &lt;BR&gt;introspection and transformation of internal attitude.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a norm=\r\nal &lt;BR&gt;sadhaka or a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of &lt;BR&gt;sis=\r\nhyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Without his [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobod=\r\ny and would &lt;BR&gt;be lower than\n dirt. I would not be able to say anything in=\r\ntelligent &lt;BR&gt;or meaningful in spiritual matters. Those who are impressed/i=\r\nnspired &lt;BR&gt;by something I write should be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pa=\r\nndit &lt;BR&gt;and to Sri Ramakrishna for showering their grace using me as an &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;instrument and not to me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW, you are all free to forwa=\r\nrd my posts that you like to &lt;BR&gt;people who may be interested in spiritual =\r\ndiscussions.

It is dangerous to follow &lt;BR&gt;someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; el=\r\nse&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Following the path of dharma basically means=\r\n engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;&gt; action/duty. Right action varies from perso=\r\nn to person, from time &lt;BR&gt;to time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and from place to place. It is =\r\ndependent on what nature expects &lt;BR&gt;from you, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; which in turn is ba=\r\nsed on who you have been in the\n past, what &lt;BR&gt;actions you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did in=\r\n the past while identifying with the action, who you &lt;BR&gt;affected in the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what &lt;BR&gt;d=\r\nebts you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you ac=\r\ncumulated &lt;BR&gt;until &lt;BR&gt;&gt; now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If, based on one&#39;s menta=\r\nl tendencies and karmic debts, nature &lt;BR&gt;wants a person &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to kill e=\r\nvil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s mental &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the &lt;BR&gt;me=\r\nssage of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. I=\r\nf, based &lt;BR&gt;on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature w=\r\nants a person to &lt;BR&gt;spread the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ritual of homam in the world, that=\r\n becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based &lt;BR&gt;on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental tendencies an=\r\nd karmic debts, nature wants a person to make &lt;BR&gt;a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; money a=\r\nnd construct a temple,\n that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to =\r\nkill his &lt;BR&gt;gurus, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such t=\r\nhat there was too &lt;BR&gt;much weight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth=\r\n to be relieved of some weight. &lt;BR&gt;Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; destruction was to =\r\ntake place and civilization destroyed to a &lt;BR&gt;great extent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to we=\r\nlcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great &lt;BR&gt;warrior, =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to =\r\nkill &lt;BR&gt;them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the =\r\n19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Y=\r\nogananda had been &lt;BR&gt;Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; previous life, according to Rama=\r\nkrishna) , his\n dharma was &lt;BR&gt;different in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; new time and plac=\r\ne. He was born to renounce material life despite &lt;BR&gt;his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aristocra=\r\ntic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and &lt;BR&gt;inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and &lt;BR&gt;service t=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nRamakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be s=\r\nomething &lt;BR&gt;else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The tricky quest=\r\nion is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some peo=\r\nple have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your &lt;BR&gt;own dharma &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;concept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long t=\r\nime, the &lt;BR&gt;concept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmik=\r\ni was a shudra who lived &lt;BR&gt;by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; killing birds. He became a brahman=\r\na and a\n maharshi later. &lt;BR&gt;Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kshatrita and a pow=\r\nerful king. He became a brahmana and and a &lt;BR&gt;maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; later. Bas=\r\nically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with &lt;BR&gt;the varna &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As &lt;BR&gt;o=\r\nne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one do=\r\nes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which t=\r\nells you to &lt;BR&gt;know your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreove=\r\nr, there are not just 4 &lt;BR&gt;dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the world. Each person has =\r\nindividual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very ve=\r\nry very difficult. If one &lt;BR&gt;is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;=\r\ns dharma. In fact, all of us have a &lt;BR&gt;part of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind that tell=\r\ns us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a &lt;BR&gt;lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nois=\r\ne from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, &lt;BR&gt;we get\n =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; confused.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We should make the best judgment combin=\r\ning discrimination and &lt;BR&gt;intuition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; decide what is our dharma=\r\n and follow it sincerely. We may be err, &lt;BR&gt;but doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the best we=\r\n can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; More than following dharma, wh=\r\nat is of utmost importance is to &lt;BR&gt;engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions without ide=\r\nntification. *That* alone ensures that we are &lt;BR&gt;not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; accumulating=\r\n new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should &lt;BR&gt;not build &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the &lt;BR&gt;best=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma i=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;the given &lt;BR&gt;&gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-=\r\nidentification &lt;BR&gt;with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; action as possible. When the action is=\r\n finished, we should leave &lt;BR&gt;the result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to god. We should not th=\r\nink &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen &lt;BR&gt;now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; work&quot;\n etc. S=\r\nuch adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication &lt;BR&gt;through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; untac=\r\nhed action) will simplify our ego and purify our &lt;BR&gt;consciousness slowly. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly =\r\nenable us to &lt;BR&gt;see our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incu=\r\nrring new karmas. This is &lt;BR&gt;not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but not as difficult as pe=\r\nople think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not followin=\r\ng one&#39;s dharma, &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refine=\r\nd with time if one engages in &lt;BR&gt;action with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; little attachment.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s inte=\r\nllect and intuition are the &lt;BR&gt;inputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Another external input is =\r\nthe words of scriptures and learned men. &lt;BR&gt;One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; derive one&#39;s =\r\ndharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n &lt;BR&gt;spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the &lt;BR&gt;word=\r\ns of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and th=\r\nought &lt;BR&gt;killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a gur=\r\nu in Krishna who &lt;BR&gt;clarified his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda) was confused about &lt;BR&gt;his dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and wanted to ren=\r\nounce the world and go to a secluded place to do &lt;BR&gt;sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rama=\r\nkrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in &lt;BR&gt;the materia=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One wh=\r\no is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, &lt;BR&gt;what one&#39;s &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;of what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul wit=\r\nh a clear &lt;BR&gt;insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n inner core, such a guru can give=\r\n perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline is th=\r\nat I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of &lt;BR&gt;principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; decla=\r\nre that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to &lt;BR&gt;person, from &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no &lt;BR&gt;thumbr=\r\nules to find &lt;BR&gt;&gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s u=\r\nnderstanding &lt;BR&gt;of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma by increasing internal purity.
