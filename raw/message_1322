They =\r\nalso conduct online classes and \nyou can view their ashram as they have web=\r\ncams.\n\nShe in this life considers Shri Ramakrishna Paramhans as her guru an=\r\nd \nhad visions of him from a very early stage. Her biograpghy has many \ndet=\r\nails.\n\nHer web site has all the information about the books.\nI consider the=\r\n books from them a gold standard in presentation, \nquality and content.\n\nI =\r\nuse their books for all/any pooja I do like Satyanarayan vrath \nkatha, Shiv=\r\n Pooja, Laxmi Pooji, Chandi Paath, Hanuman Pooja etc.\n\nBy the way Sant Shre=\r\ne Mota was a realized soul, I know very little of \nhim, except that he was =\r\na great saint.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, A=\r\nshwin Rawal &lt;a.rawal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Miteshji, I have first time heard the =\r\nname of Shree Ma of North \nEast.
