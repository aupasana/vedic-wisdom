There are external Rituals and/or direct mental processes (such as Ha=\r\nvan, continuous Vichara for instance) which has capacity to take one relati=\r\nvely quickly to goal (fast Burning of Karmas and hence more and more detach=\r\ned actions, reduction of Ego sense of me & Mine and all such fundamentals) =\r\nas compared to some other Spiritual Sadhanas.

Otherwise it does =\r\nnot help. And the only parameters of judgement is to objectively see what c=\r\nhanges are happening in our surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are w=\r\ne less angry, more equanimous, etc etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; The field of experiences - vi=\r\nsions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it can be genuine and plen=\r\nty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spiritual people have=\r\n never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand these things properly=\r\n, but some pattern is observable.=A0 Not all experiences are what they seem=\r\n to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of experiences, not =\r\nbeing able to adequately determine which is genuine and which is non-genuin=\r\ne. This is the world of=A0 astral plane, driven by the overlapping shealths=\r\n of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik =\r\nterminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlapping and =\r\nnot discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=A0 is possible here. E=\r\nvery higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation in this realm, b=\r\nut limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of varies charact=\r\ner and hue who can very easily create an\n&gt;  expereince for a sadhaka to del=\r\nude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/aura of a higher=\r\n deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him/her for its=\r\n own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower extreme of which causes=\r\n, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driven by attractio=\r\nns, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, ange=\r\nr (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the other extreme t=\r\nhis layer can, if=A0 properly channalized as is done in genuine Vaishava Bh=\r\nakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah=\r\n&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path. \n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experi=\r\nence&quot; is good and authentic only to the extent that it helps to modify and =\r\ntransform your waking surface personality. That is the only true test. Rest=\r\n all the range of experiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent of =\r\nYogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury without=\r\n substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the interme=\r\ndiate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away b=\r\ny the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross this realm,=\r\n and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang on tightly t=\r\no the fundamentals. \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards \n&gt; =A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimA=\r\npannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam=\r\n ||[7:24] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pat=\r\nhak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday=\r\n, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM \n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought \n&gt; \n&gt; Dea=\r\nr Rajarshi, \n&gt; \n&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!
