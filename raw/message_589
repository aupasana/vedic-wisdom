Pleas=\r\ne remember that the energy in the ashes is\n only a&lt;BR&gt;*part* of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\ne energy generated. Some energy is also within the person&lt;BR&gt;performing hom=\r\nam &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and helps to purify the person. Giving some part back to the na=\r\nture&lt;BR&gt;is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; very good idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast=\r\n/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homa=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 01, 2008=\r\n 7:18 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] questions w.r.t.
