There is no significant change within society without such a written wor=\r\nk as a guide. &quot;The Dharma Manifesto&quot; is that book for our era.\n\nThe concept=\r\n that is encapsulated in the word &quot;Dharma&quot;, which in the ancient Sanskrit l=\r\nanguage means &quot;Natural Law&quot;, is predicated upon the recognized need for the=\r\n organic and munificent sacralization of culture and of all human concern, =\r\nas well as the manifestation of the highest potentials attainable by each h=\r\numan person in society. &quot;The Dharma Manifesto&quot; is designed to serve as a sy=\r\nstematic revolutionary manifesto signaling the beginning of a wholly new er=\r\na in humanity&#39;s eternal yearning for meaningful freedom and happiness.\n\nDha=\r\nrma Sun Media\nPaperback $16.23\nEbook $12.10\n274 pgs\n\n\nAvailable Here: http:=\r\n//www.dharmanation.org/?page_id=3D125\n\n\nAum Tat Sat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
