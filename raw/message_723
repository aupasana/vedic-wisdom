Doing it in the open is =\r\nactually\n&gt; &gt; better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain =\r\ncan\n&gt; &gt; cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is\n&gt; &gt; extinguis=\r\nhed by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a=\r\n homa kundam with bricks and sand at the\n&gt; &gt; bottom. Use a square shaped hu=\r\nma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio f=\r\nile, should one\n&gt; &gt; repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audi=\r\no?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while listening attentively (not ca=\r\nsually).\n&gt; &gt; Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention foc=\r\nused is\n&gt; &gt; as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is=\r\n chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane\n&gt; &gt; matter in the mind. Sup=\r\npose person Y is listening to it with focus and\n&gt; &gt; thinking of the mantra =\r\nand its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing\n&gt; &gt; for person X and yet pers=\r\non Y may benefit from the mantra. The word\n&gt; &gt; mantra means &quot;one that prote=\r\ncts the mind&quot;. One can say a mantra or\n&gt; &gt; listen to a mantra, to be protec=\r\nted. The key is control over the mind\n&gt; &gt; and keeping the mind focused on t=\r\nhe mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between meditation a=\r\nnd homam. Mantra\n&gt; &gt; is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it=\r\n is submitted in\n&gt; &gt; the external fire as well in a homam. So making some e=\r\nxternal sound\n&gt; &gt; (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chan=\r\nting or just\n&gt; &gt; listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bach=\r\nelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other\n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. An=\r\nybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) has been\n&gt; &gt; performed can =\r\ndo it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow th=\r\ne yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever\n&gt; &gt; rules one&#39;s guru sets, =\r\none should follow them strictly. At the\n&gt; &gt; minimum, one should eat only ve=\r\ngetarian food on the day of homam and\n&gt; &gt; take a bath before homam. Another=\r\n rule I will recommend is to avoid\n&gt; &gt; eating any solid food 2 hours before=\r\n homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do=\r\n homam for\n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility and =\r\nallow them\n&gt; &gt; to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru a=\r\nnd perform\n&gt; &gt; homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the pro=\r\ncess until\n&gt; &gt; the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through=\r\n homam and\n&gt; &gt; other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up and make the person\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one desires no sp=\r\necific material benefits (and ready to\n&gt; &gt; receive whatever god gives) and =\r\ndoes homam for spiritual progress, I\n&gt; &gt; am willing to help, even if it mea=\r\nns some suffering for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam=\r\n? or any day would be fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best =\r\nis a Chaturthi morning. But any\n&gt; &gt; day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish trave=\r\nled\n&gt; &gt; together to several places (on a specific project). We ended up doi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). Before th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; only in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment\n&gt; &gt; com=\r\nplex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is\n&gt; &gt; going=\r\n to rain heavily in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just\n&gt; &gt; smiled.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. Af=\r\nter we\n&gt; &gt; offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas,\n&gt; &gt; clo=\r\nsed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa\n&gt; &gt; kundas =\r\nuntil fire in the two homa kundas went off and then packed\n&gt; &gt; everything a=\r\nnd went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but\n&gt; &gt; we were told =\r\nthat a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi.\n&gt; &gt; In fact, rain =\r\nfollowed us on that trip as we covered the north, east\n&gt; &gt; and west of Indi=\r\na. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished\n&gt; &gt; our task in that=\r\n place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Vel=\r\naga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few\n&gt; &gt; questio=\r\nns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the r=\r\noof top of a house(3-floors) ?\n&gt; &gt; Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arran=\r\nging red bricks, with sand base be used\n&gt; &gt; instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Ca=\r\nn bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam?
