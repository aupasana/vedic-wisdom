A lot of \n&gt; people are starving without food to eat. As t=\r\nhose who can afford food \n&gt; waste the limited food that is available, that =\r\njacks up food prices and \n&gt; makes it even more inaccessible to starving peo=\r\nple. This is already a \n&gt; serious problem according to scientists and I am =\r\nafraid will get much \n&gt; worse in coming decades.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given this, wasting f=\r\nood is a really really really terrible sin in \n&gt; today&#39;s times. Please don&#39;=\r\nt waste food. This includes:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Cooking more food than you need and t=\r\nhrowing it away,\n&gt; (2) Serving more food than you can eat in your plate and=\r\n throwing it \n&gt; away\n&gt; (3) Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and =\r\nletting them get \n&gt; spoiled\n&gt; \n&gt; Please treat Mother Annapurna (personifica=\r\ntion of food that sustains us) \n&gt; with respect, love and humility (rather t=\r\nhan arrogance, contempt and \n&gt; pride). World (and we) needs her blessings a=\r\nnd kindness.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; On a similar note, some ladies d=\r\no rituals where chick peas soaked in \n&gt; water, fruits etc, sweets etc are d=\r\nistributed to other ladies. I have \n&gt; seen so many ladies casually get thes=\r\ne food items, let them rot and then \n&gt; throw them away. The notion that giv=\r\ning food to people is good karma is \n&gt; based on the assumption that they ac=\r\ntually eat it or use otherwise. If \n&gt; they waste it, it is bad karma for bo=\r\nth parties.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please do not accept any food that you cannot use. Also, d=\r\non&#39;t \n&gt; distribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, feed homeles=\r\ns, \n&gt; needy people. Doing rituals with no common sense and just for the hec=\r\nk \n&gt; of it, is not good. Such rituals produce no results whatsoever. Blindl=\r\ny \n&gt; adhering to traditions that are doing no good really, is like dressing=\r\n a \n&gt; corpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use common sense and do \n&gt;=\r\n *real* good to others and the world, than engaging in fake *symbols* \n&gt; th=\r\nat in reality harm the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the strong language, but I do =\r\nsee many people abusing Mother \n&gt; Annapoorna and I think this is terrible f=\r\nor the world. This needs to \n&gt; change.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
