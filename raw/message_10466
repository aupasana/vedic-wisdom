This is a\n great time for worshipping divine mother, for =\r\nChandipath,\n Chandi homam, any prayers of Durga, prayers of Rama, Sundara\n =\r\nkanda etc.\n \n \n \n *        *        *\n \n \n \n Many people apply tithi of sun=\r\nrise to the entire day. This\n is IMHO applicable for celebrations/poojas th=\r\nat primarily\n take place in the morning at sunrise time (which is the case\n=\r\n traditionally with most poojas).\n \n \n \n But some poojas (e.g. Satya Naraya=\r\nna vratam) happen at\n sunset and you have to see tithi at that time. For\n M=\r\nahashivaratri, shastras are clear that Magha Krishna\n Chaturdasi should be =\r\nactive at midnight when the special\n pooja is to be done.\n \n \n \n In general=\r\n, you are better off checking the tithi at the\n time of your pooja, esp if =\r\nyour pooja is happening way after\n sunrise.\n \n \n \n Navaratris are centered =\r\naround the evening time pooja (name\n itself has ratri =3D night). Ideally, =\r\nyou should check the\n tithi at sunset and not sunrise. In my reckoning also=\r\n,\n navaratris start on 24th itself in India too.\n \n \n \n Where I live (near =\r\nBoston, MA, USA), it is 24th either way.\n Sukla pratipada starts in the nig=\r\nht and active at sunrise of\n 24th and at sunset too. So navaratris clearly =\r\nstart on 24th\n (Wednesday).\n \n \n \n However, someone people who blindly foll=\r\now Indian calendars\n are thinking that it starts on 25th. Depending on the\n=\r\n definition used, one can argue 24th or 25th for India, but\n it is 24th eit=\r\nher way in US.\n \n \n \n Best regards,\n \n \n \n Narasimha\n \n --------\n \n Astrolo=\r\ngy & Spirituality Resources:\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n \n --------\n \n=\r\n \n \n &gt;________________________________\n \n &gt; From: &quot;Durgesh Mishra durgesh.m=\r\nishra@...\n [vedic-wisdom]&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n \n &gt;To: ved=\r\nic-astrology@yahoogroups.com;\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n \n &gt;Sent: Tues=\r\nday, September 23, 2014 3:19 AM\n \n &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Navratra fast b=\r\neginning\n \n &gt; \n \n &gt;\n \n &gt;\n \n &gt;  \n \n &gt;Respected Gurujan,\n \n &gt;\n \n &gt;\n \n &gt;As you=\r\n might have already noticed that Navratra is\n beginning from 25th Sept,2014=\r\n, as per most of the calendars\n in India.
