The priest you mentioned below simply showed poor judgment and understanding.\n \nWhen one blows air into homa kundam directly from mouth, small amounts of one&#39;s saliva and one&#39;s germs get into homa kundam. That is a very bad idea.\n \nWhen one must absolutely blow air, Vimalananda suggests blowing through hand or some other object, i.e. you blow onto your palm and the air reflects at a slight angle and goes into homa kundam. That is better.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI never blow air. When fire is getting smaller, I offer ghee, sesame seeds or wood to make it bigger. One need not wait so long that fire is about to extinguish. One should make it bigger earlier.\n \nIdeally, there should be fire in a bigger part of homa kundam than smoke. If fire has gone out in a bigger part of the homa kundam and there is smoke and if fire is present in a smaller part of homa kundam, that is inauspicious and ineffective. Lord Vishnu specifically taught that homam should be done with more fire in homa kundam than smoke.\n \nThus, the habit of waiting till fire becomes so small that it comes close to extinguishing, is a bad one to start with. One should maintain a bigger fire always.\n \n*        *        *\n  \nWhen a sadhaka with a very thin kaarmik pipeline does something, the result is seen very soon. So, if one starts a wrong practice, one will see the result soon and learn one&#39;s lesson. When someone with a very deep kaarmik pipeline starts engaging in a wrong practice, the result may be seen much much later. By that time, one may have done that wrong thing too many times.\n \nIn the old days, priests used to do intense sadhana and burn their karmas. Even if they did something wrong, they would quickly figure it out and correct themselves. Many priests of today have very deep kaarmik pipelines, do not do much sadhana and the Nature&#39;s feedback system is broken.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen a priest or someone respectable does something incorrect, one can speak out if one thinks there is a reasonable chance of benefit from speaking out. Some priests are open-minded and understanding, but some are egoistic and they do not want to be corrected by laymen. If one questions a priest and the priest becomes angry, can one remain calm or will one start to feel guilty or scared? If so, one should not question. One should not do something, unless one is prepared for the consequences.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- pinky s &lt;shakti.axapta@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Respected sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the inspriration of &quot;Do Homam Yourself&quot; from Pujya Sri PVR Narasimha\n&gt; rao garu, i thought it would be a gud idea to perform mahalakshmi homam\n&gt; during sravana month friday and approached a brahmin priest for the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lotus flowers dipped in honey, Bilva fruits, Bilva leaves and other flowers\n&gt; were offered during the homa with 16 times recital of Srisuktham. With the\n&gt; virtue of knowledge gained from your previous posts, which essentially said\n&gt; that any sattvic material can be offered to gods in the homam fire, i took a\n&gt; piece of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a great\n&gt; spritual experience. i felt that i gained a lot of positive energy from the\n&gt; homam. i strongly felt that my offerings reached mahalakshmi devi directly\n&gt; through the homakunda. Such is the impact of your teaching about\n&gt; Homam-significance on me! Thank you, sir.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest&#39;s action during\n&gt; homam. When the homam fire was weakened and about to extinguish, the priest\n&gt; has blown air through his mouth directly into teh homa kundam to increase\n&gt; the intensity of flames in it :(\n&gt; i have heard from my grandmother that blowing air through mouth into a\n&gt; flame/fire is equal to spitting on it and its a very unholy act. Since then\n&gt; i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that my &#39;fire\n&gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledge may not be relevant\n&gt; for the homam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed to\n&gt; be well experienced in performing homams.\n&gt; \n&gt; PLease comment something about this and enlighten us with your knowledge so\n&gt; that i will be careful from next time. Also, if there are any other\n&gt; ingredients specific for mahalakshmi homam, please suggest us.\n\n\n"}}
