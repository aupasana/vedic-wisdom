Excellent visualization leads to one being =\r\na better Mantra Drashta!!!!\n\nThe Nath yogis say for example &quot; One is not ab=\r\nle to travel to Kashi Vishwavanth and wishes to offer Mental Pradakshina to=\r\n Lord Vishwanath . He should visualize the Temple its surroundings in all i=\r\nts glory with all its intricate details and the important point is it shoul=\r\nd take the same amount of time it would take in the real world &quot;\n\nIf one ha=\r\ns to do a mental homa the visualization similarly would have to be equally =\r\ndetailed with each step happenning mentally and it taking similar amount of=\r\n time.\n\nI think theoretically the effect of Mental homa would be manifold e=\r\nxcept that due to impurities in the nadis of one not used to sadhana it is =\r\nmuch better to do external homa for many years and sharpen that visualizati=\r\non .\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Dh=\r\nananjay S Ghole &lt;dghole1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Gam Ganapataye Namah ||\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing a homam mentally - that was the topic=C2=A0I=\r\n was thinking about this morning. \n&gt; Can I do a homam mentally?=C2=A0Can yo=\r\nu please elaborate on the procedure?

Thus, worship of deities, demigo=\r\nds, \n&gt; xians, supernatural beings (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as =\r\npracticed in \n&gt; these folk religions were not replaced by Confucian philoso=\r\nphy but they \n&gt; co-existed. Moreover, Confucianism stressed honesty, ritual=\r\ns and rites (which \n&gt; extended to proper social behavior), sacrifice and fi=\r\nlial piety.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, even if Chinese may not explicitly believe in a spec=\r\nific definition of \n&gt; God, an implicit concept of god has influenced the ev=\r\nolution of the value \n&gt; system, philosophy and culture they so faithfully f=\r\nollowed.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, communist rule changed things.

That is why\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not deserve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the s=\r\nervice of paramhamsas now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid our understanding of th=\r\ne word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swan is supposed to abl=\r\ne to remove water from milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt;(absolute swan) i=\r\ns one who can extract out the bad in a person and leave him \n&gt; &gt;with the go=\r\nod that is already in him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who \n&gt; &gt;can=\r\n interact with ANYONE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;into an ideal person. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated w=\r\nith \n&gt; &gt;drunkards and womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed th=\r\nem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks the world does not deserve one&#39;s services an=\r\nd lives in a cave, \n&gt; &gt;one may be great and realized, but not a paramahamsa=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, look at Parasara&#39;s directives on=\r\n finding a paramahamsa. He said \n&gt; &gt;Mercury in 5th from karakamsa makes one=\r\n a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not \n&gt; &gt;Jupiter?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jupiter i=\r\ns wise, but Mercury is flexible and adaptive. Mercury can identify \n&gt; &gt;with=\r\n anyone. Mercury is compassionate and can place himself in the shoes of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;anyone and think/feel like that person. That is also why Mercury is the ka=\r\nraka \n&gt; &gt;for good communication skills. A good communicator can visualize f=\r\nrom the angle \n&gt; &gt;of his audience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna once identified=\r\n with grass so strongly that when a crow walked on \n&gt; &gt;the grass, there wer=\r\ne bloody scratches on his body. Such ability to identify \n&gt; &gt;with someone e=\r\nlse is needed for transforming someone else. That is why Parasara \n&gt; &gt;menti=\r\noned Mercury for Paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //There is =\r\nno dearth of Chanakyas even today. There is, however, not a \n&gt; &gt;single \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandragupta now. Few &quot;experts&quot;, if any, know that Chanakya was a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;paramhamsa \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhu.

Ho=\r\nwever, the \n&gt; &gt;bottomline is that it is never possible to articulate this k=\r\nnowledge perfectly, \n&gt; &gt;using vaikhari. Knowledge like this can be digested=\r\n and absorbed only though \n&gt; &gt;experience and not through reading or hearing=\r\n words spoken in vaikhari.

Your keyword in &quot;What a gyani does&quot; is &quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma =\r\nof a Gyani. \n&gt; &gt;It is very difficult to understand KARMA, as Gita says. Pro=\r\nper definitions of \n&gt; &gt;Karma, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are needed. Since nobod=\r\ny can live without doing \n&gt; &gt;something, as Gita says, what is Akarma in fac=\r\nt? Whatever be the mode or type of \n&gt; &gt;action of a Gyani, it is done withou=\r\nt any desire of fruit for self, and \n&gt; &gt;therefore the actions of a Gyani sh=\r\nould not be included in general Karma. The \n&gt; &gt;Karma which does not produce=\r\n phala for the performer is Akarma. Brahmasutra \n&gt; &gt;speaks of four types of=\r\n Moksha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //What a self-realized person does is dependent o=\r\nn the previous history of \n&gt; &gt;that soul and what Nature expects from one.//=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Both YES and NO! A self-realized soul has to bear whateve=\r\nr is written in \n&gt; &gt;his/her birthchart for THIS LIFE. But a self-realized s=\r\noul burns away his/her \n&gt; &gt;entire previous history of Karmas and Samskaaras=\r\n and therefore does not NEED \n&gt; &gt;rebirth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Liberated souls =\r\nand incarnations of divine agencies come again and again \n&gt; &gt;NOT for obeyin=\r\ng Prakriti blindly, but for Loka-samgraha, for which the entire \n&gt; &gt;Creatio=\r\nn was created. They gain nothing in return. Rgveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas \n&gt; &gt;=\r\ntapati Tapyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa for gaining something materia=\r\nl or \n&gt; &gt;spiritual. But why the Surya is performing Tapa? What Surya will g=\r\nain? \n&gt; &gt;Loka-samgraha, because the Surya perceives all other souls as its =\r\nown parts and \n&gt; &gt;wants their well being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; //to remain in d=\r\nuality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, and \n&gt; &gt;yet remain i=\r\nn oneness with the underlying oneness//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is the p=\r\nroper way of living in this world for a self realized \n&gt; &gt;soul. There is no=\r\n alternative in this world. One cannot remain in perpetual \n&gt; &gt;nirvikalpa s=\r\namadhi in this world. But it is not proper to call the former as a \n&gt; &gt;&quot;hig=\r\nher state&quot;. It is not advisable to discuss real Samadhi in a public fora. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;These things are taught by a spiritual Guru to the disciple according to=\r\n the \n&gt; &gt;propensity and ability of the latter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you have=\r\n used the term &quot;higher state&quot;, let me say that the highest state \n&gt; &gt;of sam=\r\nadhi is indeed that type of samadhi which was attained in battlefield by \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;entire dynasty of Rama, and for sometime by Arjuna. It is &quot;Yoga of the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Rajarshis&quot; according to Gita, which had vanished from this world after Ik=\r\nshvaku \n&gt; &gt;dynasty and was temporarily given to Arjuna after a long absence=\r\n during entire \n&gt; &gt;Dvapar yuga.

If the veil of delusion=\r\n is removed, there is no duality and \n&gt; &gt;all is ONE uniform and undivided c=\r\nonsciousness, known variously as Aatman or \n&gt; &gt;Brahman or Narayana or Sadas=\r\nhiva. This one uniform and undivided consciousness \n&gt; &gt;is known as &quot;unmanif=\r\nested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality, where there are many \n&gt; &gt;different ob=\r\njects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that went through \n&gt; &gt;som=\r\ne modification and manifestation. It is known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;are Brahman only.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Normally, living in the domain =\r\nof duality without being deluded by some \n&gt; &gt;aspect of duality or the other=\r\n is near to impossible. Remaining in duality with \n&gt; &gt;a perfect understandi=\r\nng of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving \n&gt; &gt;all those ob=\r\njects of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion for \n&gt; &gt;any s=\r\ningle object of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;to reach the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in wh=\r\nich there \n&gt; &gt;is no duality and no objectification - and become absorbed in=\r\n that state \n&gt; &gt;forever. That is the advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi&quot; and what \n&gt; &gt;happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, mahar=\r\nshis have described higher states. It is possible to be in \n&gt; &gt;oneness with=\r\n manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It is \n&gt; &gt;po=\r\nssible to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all=\r\n obejcts \n&gt; &gt;and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or r=\r\nepulsion for any \n&gt; &gt;object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the s=\r\nenses is not the problem. \n&gt; &gt;The tendency of mind to be find some attracti=\r\nve and find some repulsive is the \n&gt; &gt;problem. It is possible to remain in =\r\na state where there is neither attraction \n&gt; &gt;nor repulsion for any object =\r\nis possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a state is experienced by very few b=\r\neings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, \n&gt; &gt;Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state =\r\nalways. Swami Vivekananda also \n&gt; &gt;experienced it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ris=\r\nhis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are always \n&gt; &gt;ale=\r\nrt to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality an=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt;yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attra=\r\nction and \n&gt; &gt;repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much do =\r\nanything. But \n&gt; &gt;because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything,=\r\n it means one has no \n&gt; &gt;personal ego and one has no reason to do anything =\r\nfor personal ego. Then one \n&gt; &gt;becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) a=\r\nnd implements the wish of nature \n&gt; &gt;through one&#39;s actions, which are perfo=\r\nrmed without any attachment or personal \n&gt; &gt;identification. One who has a p=\r\nersonal ego can do limited things. One who has a \n&gt; &gt;very very small ego ca=\r\nn do great things. One who has no ego can do ANY thing. \n&gt; &gt;But such a bein=\r\ng does things that are desired by Nature - the natural order of \n&gt; &gt;the uni=\r\nverse. They can change the course of history of nations and planets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rishi in this state may engage in various actions of great=\r\n consequence \n&gt; &gt;for the world. Yet, there is no attachment with the action=\r\ns. He is just an \n&gt; &gt;unattached instrument of Nature.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIf one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested \n&gt; &gt;Bra=\r\nhman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thu=\r\ns, he will \n&gt; &gt;freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. A=\r\nmsa of such a rishi \n&gt; &gt;may even be born again as a separate person, just a=\r\ns a process running in a \n&gt; &gt;computer may spawn off a separate thread to do=\r\n some focussed task. Even if the \n&gt; &gt;computer process has finished all the =\r\ninitialization and early work, the newly \n&gt; &gt;spawned thread has to go throu=\r\ngh initialization etc again. Similarly, the person \n&gt; &gt;born with amsa has t=\r\no go through the process of overcoming weaknesses and \n&gt; &gt;realizing self al=\r\nl over again. When a Vivekananda is born from the amsa of a \n&gt; &gt;rishi, he m=\r\nay have to struggle initially and overcome the weaknesses and realize \n&gt; &gt;s=\r\nelf all over again. But he is the amsa of an ever free and liberated being =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt;will find his way again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a liberated ris=\r\nhi, with the force of his liberated consciousness \n&gt; &gt;and with the force of=\r\n his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of \n&gt; &gt;Nature perfo=\r\nrming actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego \n&gt; &gt;drivi=\r\nng those actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna specifically said s=\r\nix of his disciples were ever \n&gt; &gt;liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The full message can be read at:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rishis&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ..spiritual Guru of Swami Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramhamsa..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vasishtha, Viswamitra and Rama w=\r\nere all gyanis.

When \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekanada, before he became worl=\r\nd famous, had gone to Kasi, he was \n&gt; &gt;bitterly \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed =\r\nby the &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city on various issues. \n&gt; &gt;Then a young =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and decided he will=\r\n leave Kasi \n&gt; &gt;and never \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return to that city untill he =\r\n&quot;falls on society like a thunderbolt&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;Well, that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is=\r\n precisely what he did. He fell on Indian society like a \n&gt; &gt;thunderbolt, a=\r\nfter \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which those very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, aski=\r\nng him to come and \n&gt; &gt;grace \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their city! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let us keep our fingers crossed and not=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 focus on emtpy \n&gt; &gt;speculations, rather \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwait for the most interesting coming=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 decade =\r\nto unfold in all \n&gt; &gt;its=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 sound and fury.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, w=\r\nhat would be your name and religion and \n&gt; nationality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though religion usually stays the same=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt;it CAN \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change. Nationality can of course change to=\r\no. Job, skills, external \n&gt; &gt;nature, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks, gender, even=\r\n yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can \n&gt; &gt;all change \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, the se=\r\ned of one&#39;s new birth is formed at the time of one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;death. As \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s connection is severed with the body, the last \n&gt; &gt;desires/=\r\nthoughts/ponderings \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the mind become the seed for the =\r\nnext life. Nature chooses for one \n&gt; &gt;a future \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course th=\r\nat allows one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by \n&gt; &gt;one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous karmas and debts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If o=\r\nne is able to not entertain ANY desire as one element after \n&gt; &gt;another \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt;spiritual sadhana \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we see =\r\nyou again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall recognize you, IF WE=\r\n EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I and you like each other a=\r\nnd your rebirth and my rebirth meet \n&gt; &gt;each other, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they=\r\n will start off taking a liking to each other. If I and you \n&gt; &gt;dislike eac=\r\nh \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other,=\r\n they will \n&gt; &gt;start off \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disliking each other. This will=\r\n happen without either being \n&gt; &gt;consciously aware of \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\no one was and who the other person was, in the last life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and s=\r\no \n&gt; &gt;person is a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and s=\r\no person is a rebirth of \n&gt; &gt;Paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, =\r\nthe answer is complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reborn person may n=\r\not look like the old person or do similar work \n&gt; &gt;or have \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; much *external* similarity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; one. \n&gt; &gt;A=\r\nfter all, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife princ=\r\niple), while Krishna \n&gt; &gt;had thousands \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wives. Rama wa=\r\ns a great warrior and killed Ravana in the biggest \n&gt; &gt;war of his \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times. Krishna was a key player in the biggest war of his time, b=\r\nut \n&gt; &gt;did not take \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a weapon at all. The game can be dif=\r\nfent in each coming..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul, it can=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;become a trap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna explicitly tol=\r\nd Sarada Mata that he would be back after \n&gt; &gt;100 years \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand that everybody else who came with him would have to come back \n&gt; &gt;with =\r\nhim. When \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he sai=\r\nd they did not have a \n&gt; &gt;choice! Even \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda=\r\n said once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once more. \n&gt; &gt;The Master \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I am to come back once more with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you =\r\nhave \n&gt; &gt;to come \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;,=\r\n he replied, &quot;souls like that \n&gt; &gt;have great \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power, Mada=\r\nm&quot;. On another occasion, Ramakrishna said that people \n&gt; &gt;would get \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberated en masse during his next coming and that would be the=\r\n last \n&gt; &gt;opportunity \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time to come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarna=\r\ntions of \n&gt; &gt;Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since then. One of them is wron=\r\ng (or perhaps both!). Another good \n&gt; &gt;saint \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested t=\r\nhat she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai \n&gt; &gt;Baba said \n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he identified a particular young man as the reincarnatio=\r\nn of \n&gt; &gt;Swami \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded b=\r\ny Sarada Mata and more than \n&gt; &gt;twenty \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disciples of a ve=\r\nry high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, \n&gt; &gt;they nearly \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next century. N=\r\none \n&gt; &gt;of the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded b=\r\ny people of such caliber or \n&gt; &gt;fit the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of=\r\n a great \n&gt; &gt;soul! It is not \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are lying. They m=\r\nay simply be deluding themselves and of \n&gt; &gt;course ego is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; the root of delusion!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, is it necessa=\r\nry to recognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, \n&gt; &gt;given that X \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Y are different and play a different game? A small discussion on =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;this point \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s examp=\r\nle can be found in:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though external factors like nationality, religion, name,=\r\n job, looks, \n&gt; &gt;gender etc \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can change, some internal fa=\r\nctors may remain the same. Moreover, who \n&gt; &gt;one likes, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwho one dislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, etc, \n&gt; &gt;may =\r\nremain \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; essentially the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim \n&gt; &gt;empe=\r\nror Akbar \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and =\r\nthe other was a Muslim. \n&gt; &gt;However, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both were very brav=\r\ne, unafraid of death, inherently spiritual, had a \n&gt; &gt;refined \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous connections =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;with \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised=\r\n when his mother was \n&gt; &gt;hiding at a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajput household, b=\r\nefore moving to Delhi. Despite being a Muslim, he \n&gt; &gt;actually \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; helped the Hindu causes (to the extent possible at that time) by \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;putting an end \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to barbaric practices like killing defea=\r\nted Hindu kings and all Hindu \n&gt; &gt;priests in \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conquered p=\r\nlaces. He promoted acceptance of other faiths, canceled \n&gt; &gt;pilgrimage \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taxes on Hindus and even came up with his own religion of hu=\r\nmanity \n&gt; &gt;towards the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end of his life by integrating va=\r\nrious religions. In one life, he \n&gt; &gt;tried to save \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; India=\r\n from invading barbarians. In another, he was born as a cultured \n&gt; &gt;man am=\r\nid \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; barbarians and tried to save India by changing the wa=\r\nys of his own \n&gt; &gt;people. There \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a subtle continuity i=\r\nn the agenda at a deeper level!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;=\r\njyotish_vani@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Lokesh_ji,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As nearly ALL of do except this &quot;BABAJI&quot; Ch=\r\naracter described in \n&gt; &gt;Lahiri Mahashay \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(no connection=\r\n with the ayanamshaa that is causing lot of problems \n&gt; &gt;for many!), \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yukteshwar and Yognanda and Kriya Yoga -- shall probably die =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt;hopefully be \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;born again -- here is a simple que=\r\nstion from a simpleton:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, wha=\r\nt would be your name and religion and \n&gt; &gt;nationality, when we \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;see you again and do you know how we shall recognize you, IF WE EVE=\r\nR \n&gt; &gt;MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not being FLIPPANT at=\r\n all but just reminding you and myself \n&gt; &gt;how evanescent \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;each of us truly ARE!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rohiniranjan\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
