Meditation alone is true worship. Hence one sh=\r\nould constantly worship the Lord of the three worlds by means of meditation=\r\n. How should one contemplate him? He is pure intelligence, he is as radiant=\r\n as a thousand suns risen together, he is the light that illumines all ligh=\r\nts, he is the inner light, the limitless space is his throat, the firmament=\r\n is his feet, the directions are his arms, the worlds are the weapons he be=\r\nars in his hands, the entire universe is hidden in his heart, the gods are =\r\nhairs on his body, the cosmic potencies are energies in his body, time is h=\r\nis gate-keeper and he has thousands of heads, eyes, ears and arms. He touch=\r\nes all, tastes all, he hears all, he thinks through all though he is beyond=\r\n thiniking. He does everything at all times, he bestows whatever one thinks=\r\n of or desires, he dwells in all, he is the all, he alone is to be sought b=\r\ny all. Thus\n should one contemplate him.\n=A0\n&quot;The Lord is not to be worship=\r\nped by material substances but by one&#39;s own consciousness. Not be waving of=\r\n lamps nor lighting incense, nor by offering flowers nor even by offering f=\r\nood or sandalpaste. He is worshipped by self-realisation alone. This is the=\r\n supreme meditation, this is the supreme worship: the continuous and unbrok=\r\nen awareness of the indwelling presence, inner light or consciousness. Whil=\r\ne doing whatever one is doing - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating=\r\n, moving, sleeping, breathing or talking - one should realize one&#39;s essenti=\r\nal nature as pure consciousness.\n=A0\n&quot;One should contemplate that the Lord =\r\nis the intelligence in the body. The various functions and faculties in the=\r\n body serve that intelligence as consorts serve their lord.
