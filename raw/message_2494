Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow hi=\r\nm to &quot;serve god&quot;?\n\nIt is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *wel=\r\nl*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devot=\r\nion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal perso=\r\nn may think various things in mind even when serving god. There is some sel=\r\nf-centeredness and ego even in serving god.\n\nThe god in your homam fire is =\r\nnot an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, =\r\nyou are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire an=\r\nd honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one =\r\nthing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre=\r\n-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that =\r\nyour mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and mor=\r\ne, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On=\r\n practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows=\r\n with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestatio=\r\nn of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This li=\r\nmited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than u=\r\nsed up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinit=\r\ne, all your desires and other thoughts\n will vanish and you will be able to=\r\n single-mindedly focus on that divinity.. Some precautions will help you in=\r\n the journey.\n\nKarmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in yo=\r\nur homam fire are basically being received in your internal god. If he has =\r\nenough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to g=\r\nrant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes him we=\r\naker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!\n\nOf course, when you=\r\n are offering things in fire, you yourself may have some unnecessary desire=\r\ns which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil=\r\n and there is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra=\r\n slow down?\n\nThus, this is not a matter of political correctness and being =\r\nnice.\n\nHowever, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people=\r\n very closely connected to one karmically, like wife, children and parents.=\r\n Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affec=\r\nt son&#39;s desires already (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned fami=\r\nlies). So there is no significant drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n=\r\n\nBottomline:\n\nIf some people are so close to you that you want to allow the=\r\nir karmas and their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you =\r\ndown, then allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do no=\r\nt allow specifically, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be=\r\n directly affecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!=\r\n\n\nUsually, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation bett=\r\ner..\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tar=\r\npana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -\n\n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wr=\r\note: \n&gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside =\r\nof your immediate family.

What t=\r\nhis namboodiri did is the correct way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire=\r\n as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle you=\r\nr internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identificat=\r\nion is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that externa=\r\nl fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that pers=\r\non to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be a=\r\nllowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wif=\r\ne or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the =\r\nentire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a=\r\n person with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces =\r\nand work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be=\r\n possible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all, if=\r\n you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will =\r\ndie. If you guard it and let it grow\n very\n&gt; &gt; big, it can give flowers and=\r\n fruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working t=\r\no burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning=\r\n) caused by them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol=\r\n is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fi=\r\nre and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s inter=\r\nnal fire with external fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However=\r\n, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not understand much abou=\r\nt fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is p=\r\nractically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much =\r\nas one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings =\r\ninto you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you=\r\n make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fir=\r\ne (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a=\r\n strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire wi=\r\nll become strong and burn various vaasanas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) There are differen=\r\nt methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaas=\r\na are usually standard. Do not worry about these things and do what you are=\r\n used to or what you are more attracted to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I said many times, =\r\nthese nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a par=\r\nticular body part has a higher significance than just tough a part and sayi=\r\nng it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is =\r\npossible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle=\r\n perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentially a forma=\r\nlity. I can tell you that this will not block you..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (3) They shoul=\r\nd be shown in the video.

Through your mental focus, you are projecting the li=\r\nmited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to =\r\nfocus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there =\r\nis actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many =\r\nother things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, a=\r\nccess and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it.

My questions is, is th=\r\nis where all deities reside(inside)? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapat=\r\ni, am I just bringing out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is t=\r\nhere one single, universal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exis=\r\nts in the universe, and I am trying to invite him into the fire?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I remember a line from Vimalananda where he says, initia=\r\nlly we create the deity in the astral body&nbsp;so that this deity (the one=\r\n we projected)&nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;may &lt;/EM&gt;lead us to the real deity who exists outsi=\r\nde in the universe.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Did I understand the proce=\r\ndure correct?

Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why no=\r\nt allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but =\r\nserving god *well*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded=\r\n focus and devotion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A m=\r\nore normal person may think various things in mind even when serving god. T=\r\nhere is some self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The god =\r\nin your homam fire is not an external god, but your own internal god. Throu=\r\ngh your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of god i=\r\nnside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. =\r\nI want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinit=\r\ny inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zero=\r\nes) the divinity that your\n mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focu=\r\nsing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it =\r\nfor focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can focu=\r\ns on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is t=\r\nhe limited manifestation of god inside you that you are able to focus, acce=\r\ns and perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed=\r\n to grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity gr=\r\nows and becomes infinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish a=\r\nnd you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precaut=\r\nions will help you in the journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people who=\r\n are making offerings in your homam fire are basically being received in yo=\r\nur internal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the power=\r\n of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just d=\r\no it. But that makes\n him weaker and who knows whether the desire was worth=\r\nwhile?!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yoursel=\r\nf may have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progr=\r\ness. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let som=\r\neone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, this is not a ma=\r\ntter of political correctness and being nice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, there is alre=\r\nady a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to on=\r\ne karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect hu=\r\nsband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atle=\r\nast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no signifi=\r\ncant drawback to allowing them to share fire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If =\r\nsome people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and the=\r\nir desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow =\r\nsuch people to\n offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specific=\r\nally, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly affect=\r\ning your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Usually,=\r\n that would be immediate family, but you know your situation better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ve=\r\ndicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://vedicastro. home.comcast.\n net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in=\r\n.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnarayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:narayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;narayan.iyer=\r\n@ gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family.

What this namboodiri did is =\r\nthe correct way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as =\r\nyour internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your in=\r\nternal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identification =\r\nis (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that external fi=\r\nre or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person t=\r\no your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allow=\r\ned for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or=\r\n parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the enti=\r\nre world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a per=\r\nson with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and =\r\nwork on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be pos=\r\nsible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all, if you=\r\n start plucking leaves,\n flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die=\r\n. If you guard it and let it grow very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; big, it can give flower=\r\ns and fruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep work=\r\ning to burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditi=\r\noning) caused by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But some people use fire =\r\nin the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in the=\r\nir homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly=\r\n identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does such things, it can=\r\n be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this approach do n=\r\not understand much about fire and do not have a strong identification with =\r\nthe fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and they do not ben=\r\nefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or hand=\r\nle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastr=\r\nous at\n worst.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start y=\r\nour own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mi=\r\nnd, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the =\r\nsubtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Wi=\r\nthout your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various=\r\n vaasanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods for b=\r\neeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually s=\r\ntandard.. Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to or wh=\r\nat you are more attracted to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said many tim=\r\nes, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a=\r\n particular body part has a higher significance than just tough a part and =\r\nsaying it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sound=\r\n is possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s\n s=\r\nubtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentially a =\r\nformality. I can tell you that this will not block you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; (3) They should be shown in the video.

I will eventually put a=\r\nll of them up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast.\n net&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedi=\r\ncast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath=\r\n.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@ =\r\n.&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 01, 2009 6:10 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Query related to Maha Ganapathi Homam&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaskaram PVR Narasimha Raoji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I am a big fan of the Maha Ganapathi Homam and I have\n seen it b=\r\neing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; performed at our home as a kid many times=\r\n.
