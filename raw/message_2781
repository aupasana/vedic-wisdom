Can homam be done two times a day? Will that give faster results?=\r\n\n\n2. Presently I am doing homam on a daily basis. Due to woman issues every=\r\n month I get a break of 7 days after which when I start the homam I feel th=\r\ne continuity is lost. I feel I have to start fresh. I have seen you mention=\r\n in the forums that homam should be done on a weekly or daily basis. Do you=\r\n think I will still get the benefit with breaks in between ? Is there anywa=\r\ny I can keep the continuity going? \n\n3. I have an energised mahalakshmi yan=\r\ntra which I pray on a regular basis. How should I care for it when I go on =\r\na vacation? Shall I carry it with me whereever I go so that its not neglect=\r\ned? Also can I use it in homam? \n\nThanks,\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSudha\n\n\n"}}
